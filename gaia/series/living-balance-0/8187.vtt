00:00:01.243 --> 00:00:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm

And I am so pleased to bring

in Balance" back and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.890 align:middle line:84%
She has new wisdom and
new light to share.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
"Remembering the
Language of God:

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The Forgotten Path,"
that is the title,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and the author we have with us,
Angela Trafford, and welcome.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Georgia.

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah!

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a wonderful new
book that you have just

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
created and published
for us, and there is much

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have learned
since the first book

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
that you wrote for us before.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so true.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And being a student
of life, I am learning

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
every moment of each day.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were on
our program before,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and we called it "Miracles
and Self-Healing."

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the healing process
is continuing for Angela?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and living in the
land of the miraculous.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Something new happens every day.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, now let's just
look at this new book,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
"Remembering the
Language of God."

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, what is the language of God?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The language of God and the
title "Remembering the Language

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of God" simply is stating
that each of us is born with

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
a primordial gift of the
divine within ourselves,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and we lose the connection to
that gift through childhood

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences of the lack
of unconditional love and even

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:90%
abuse in our childhood.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
grow up, we attract

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:90%
destructive relationships.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And so each of us
reaches a point

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
in our life where the suffering
is so intense that we've

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
attracted crisis in our
life, and that is the time

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to go within, and we can act
and feel the pain of our lives

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:84%
because only through
reconnecting with that pain

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the feelings
can we connect with God

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:90%
as human beings on this earth.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's, really, each person
comes to their moment of truth

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
when they're forced to look
again at their own divineness

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's too harsh
out there in reality?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, because
their life experience

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and the destructiveness of their
relationships has not brought

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
them the fulfillment and the
happiness that they expected.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to expand
ourselves in order

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to embrace another
point of view,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and transform ourselves-- first,
with the conditioning of what

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught, and
then opening the heart

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the pain
that will lead us

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:90%
into the language of God.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And the subtitle is
"The Forgotten Path."

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So we forgot our divineness.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
We forgot that essence of the
bubbly, blissful, childlike

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:90%
part of our lives.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, and we have
forgotten this because we are

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
living in an age of technology
and most of us have become very

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:90%
intellectualized.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we are out of
touch with our true feelings

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and living life
according to what

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught to believe
by our parents, by our society,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and by our churches.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to go to the
next step of our evolution,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
we have to open
our hearts to what

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe is the
experience of God that

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
is ongoing for each one of us.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's a point
in our evolution

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have to learn how to
do this because we've lost our,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
not the gift, but
we've lost the way,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and it is really the way
of love that we've lost.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And being intellectualized
in our ego, most of us

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
get lost in that control.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
really learn what it

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
means to experience
the humility,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the gratitude, the unconditional
love that is the way of love.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as I was
reading the book,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:10%
I was feeling badly for you
because I thought, gosh,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:10%
you have created a wonderful
counseling service that you do

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:10%
called self-healing,
and people come to you,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:10%
and you work with
them, you counsel them.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:10%
But people come to you when
they're in a lot of pain,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and much of what
you have learned

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:10%
about these difficulties is
that people come to you when

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:10%
they are in need, and you
have learned techniques

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:10%
that can help them self-heal.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and I feel very
fortunate that I am in that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
position where people do come
to me when they're in pain

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
because people become very
real when they are experiencing

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:90%
the pain of our lives.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably
noticed yourself

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
how much in illusion
people are today.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
People have all
kinds of conceptions

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of what spirituality is,
religious conceptions of what

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:90%
god is all about.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when people face
mortal illness, when

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
they face divorce, separation,
when people fall in love, when

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
life comes in and
intrudes on our plans,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that's when we are
forced to open our hearts

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
life is really about.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is that it is not

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:90%
what we were taught to believe.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And so then we have to find out
what is the reality of life,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and that's our challenge.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this happen to us
once or does it happen again

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and again?

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it like we wake up to a
point, and then we're OK,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
or are we going to be
then challenged again

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to look within?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are always
challenged each day.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Each choice you
make is a challenge.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But some of us are aware
of that and others aren't.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference between
being unconscious and then

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
becoming a conscious
human being.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we are
challenged each day.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have to
reach the point of crisis.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
If we find ourselves and open
our hearts on our path in life

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and truly learn how to
love first ourselves

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and then how to share that love
with our fellow human beings,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:90%
that's quite, to me, the task.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of each one of us
that's born onto this planet

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
is to learn that.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But you can't learn
that without feeling

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the pain that is part of life.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So our lessons that are hard,
they really then are our gifts

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
if we move past them, if we
don't stay in the victim mode.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to move out of the
victim though, don't we?

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we do.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to learn
how to go within and feel

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the emotional honesty that
allows us to [CHUCKLES]

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
turn some of the
experiences in our life that

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:90%
would be hurtful into our good.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I always say that I've
been spinning straw

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
into gold for the past
13 years, and that's

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
the art of living as far as I'm
concerned, it's how to do that.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And your story for the people
who have not met you before--

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
the first book that you
wrote is "The Heroic Path."

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And you-- just tell us that
story because it is beautiful

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%
of the way you healed.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's quite a story.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to try and put it
in as few words as possible.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I was living an
unconscious life,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in denial of my feelings like so
many of my brothers and sisters

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
until I finally crash-landed
into the reality of my life

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
through the
experience of cancer.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had to face
the fact that I

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
was going to die without
ever having lived.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
I wanted to live

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and that it was my
responsibility that if I wanted

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
to live, that I had to take
responsibility for my life

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and be responsible
for the choices

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
that I had to make in
order to heal my life.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself going
within through prayer

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and journaling and
expressing my feelings

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and standing up for
myself in my life,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and that was the start of it.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And going through many,
many painful experiences

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
in trying to heal
of cancer and then

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
in losing my children
through a custody

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
battle with my
abusive ex-husband

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
forced me to surrender my life
to God and to let go of my life

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to God and to ask God
to show me how to live.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So you were empowered that
you had to take responsibility,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:84%
you had to make choices that
took the control of your life

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
back so that you could be the
person that you wanted to be.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I had to let go and surrender
my life in order to take back

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:90%
my life.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like Jesus said, "He who
loses his life, shall find it."

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is interesting how--
and you have to know when you

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:84%
need to surrender and just let
go and let God and just go with

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
the flow and then when is
it time to take it back.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes power.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Desperation causes a lot of--

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --suffering to a
point of desperation too.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened to me,
where I just literally caved

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
in and fell on my knees
in my living room floor

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and surrendered my life to God.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, in
finding out that I

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:84%
had lost the custody
of my children

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and have the
occurrence of cancer,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I began to go within
through meditation, prayer,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and visualization
and start to get

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
in touch with the
reality of my life

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and had an experience where
I felt a white light moving

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:90%
through my body, healing me.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, God
really healed me

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:84%
through a miracle in
opening to this white light.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had a healing which
changed my entire life

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and put me on a path
of miracles where I now

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
recovered the custody
of my children

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and have been with my children
for the past seven years

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and then also--

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Healed of cancer.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> --healed of cancer and
got on the path of recovering

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
my purpose of life, which was
to start my work, self-healing,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and to teach people how to love
and that love beginning with

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
our own hearts for each
one of us inside ourselves,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
which is what I think
we have really lost.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of us
can love other people,

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's hard to go
within and love yourself.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But that is the
beginning point.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:90%
We have to forgive ourselves.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
We have to love ourselves.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the healing
starts with the self.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we are better
lovers and healers

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
to others if we have
gotten back to that point.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's the only way.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
We can really [CHUCKLES]
be that to anybody else

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
because I've really learned
that you can only teach people

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
by example, and having a loving
life is the best example.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you keep coming
back to the word love,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and that is the essence
of the message, is it not?

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the whole
message because--

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking
about this to somebody

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
this morning, to my publisher,
and she was telling me

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
about how she was taught
that people can't change,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and I also have.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I introduced my book with saying
something my mother always used

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to say, was that, a leopard
can't change its spots,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and another belief,
all life is suffering.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, these are all beliefs.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.552 align:middle line:90%
>> And they aren't true--

00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to
move beyond that.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> --because you can change,
but it only happens through love

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.158 align:middle line:84%
and opening the heart
and finding that love.

00:11:53.158 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going
to take a break.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back, you
have learned many techniques

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that will help us healing
because you have remembered

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:90%
the language of God.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
If you will stay tuned, we'll
be right back with Angela.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.417 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're just joining us, we're
talking to Angela Trafford.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
She is an author, which
has really fun things that

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
are happening to her.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Also, a film is going
to be filmed of you

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and your story and your life.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
American artists out
of Atlanta, Georgia

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is-- now I'm about to
sign a contract with them,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
interested in the books

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and in this journey
that has brought me

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to such a point of miracles
and fulfillment in my life

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and trying to learn about what
constitutes human happiness.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And so that's very exciting.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And also, you have a radio show.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'm going to
have my own radio show,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
KCCF out by Phoenix,
Arizona which is in Arizona.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to start
at the end of this month,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very excited
about all these things.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's what happens when
you in the land of the miracles

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.798 align:middle line:90%
and on your path in life.

00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
You never know what's
going to happen next.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things we
always have to share about you

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is that you have credibility
because the American Medical

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Association says so.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely, say that again.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You have been honored
by being recognized by AMA.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this happened
two years ago,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that the American Medical
Association designated me

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
an expert in
alternative medicine.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They honored me with
that designation

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
because so many of the people
that were coming to the doctors

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and were healing would tell
the doctors that they were also

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
coming to see me.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I became recognized which
was a really wonderful feeling.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I wondered if you
would share with us some

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of the techniques that
you use with people.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said specifically
one of the things

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that you address is addictions
and addictive behaviors.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell
us that people can

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
be doing toward doing
self-healing, our audience,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
for example, or
people they love?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say first
to start out with prayer,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and that prayer is the most
important thing because when we

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
pray, we are actually
making that connection,

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
we are seeking to make that
connection to the voice of God

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that is within each one of us.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And also meditation
because meditation

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
quiets down the voice of the
ego, the voices of the mind

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then be more
attuned to the inner voice.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.803 align:middle line:84%
And another very powerful
tool is journaling.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you mentioned
that you did that,

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and that helped you so much.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, journaling really
saved my life through a lot

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of the painful years of my
life, and actually sitting down

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and writing down my feelings
and then of course writing down

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
my dreams and seeing
what the unconscious,

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
what God was trying to reveal
to me through the symbolism

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:90%
of the dream.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then the self-awareness
is enhanced by journaling.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
You quiet the mind, and the
good information comes through.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You pray and you
open to the divine.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are all steps that
anyone can take no matter

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.077 align:middle line:90%
what is going on in their life.

00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It's towards self-healing.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
As long as we want to be
aware because a lot of people

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
come to me, and they say God
deserted them in their lives.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, God is inside
of you and all around you,

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
but you have turned from God.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most of us
have done through the suffering

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:90%
and the abuse of our lives.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So who deserted him.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and we've
become cynical.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> When we come back, that's
what we can always do,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and we could come back
always just by opening.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Just by opening
and by asking.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that most of us
feel reluctant to ask for help,

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and we've lost the faith
in God and in ourselves

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
that help is available
and that help is possible.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we
have become hopeless

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
when there's so much
hope all around us.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The addictive behaviors--

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
we're not just talking
about drug addiction,

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
but we are addicted--
as people, we

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
can become addicted to things
outside of ourselves, anything

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that we allow to control us.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we come
back to addiction--

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
are you dealing with a lot
of people who are facing

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:90%
their addictive behaviors?

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they have to.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of us
have become addicts.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:90%
We're in an addictive society.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And I define addiction
a heroic path,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
us being out of the
light of God's love.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And so what does that mean?

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It means that we're in darkness.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you come out
of the darkness?

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to be humble.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to find humility.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to become grateful.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, the
most important thing

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is you have to get in
touch with your pain,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
and not just the pain of your
life, but pain as part of life

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And through our
addictive behaviors,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we seek the stimulation
that will deny that pain,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have
to feel that pain,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and so we then
become blocked off

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
on both the light and the
love that will heal us

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and will give us a sense
of happiness and well-being

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I always say that,
there is pain in life,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%
but that misery is optional.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Yes, so it is how
we respond to it, is it not?

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as the people
that you're working with,

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and you can be then alternative
medicine in a complimentary way

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
because you're dealing
with how they're thinking

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
about their physical
disease, and then

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
the medical doctor is
dealing with the disease

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
as it has developed.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Is that kind of you're
working together?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I am helping
people find themselves,

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
their essential nature,
give birth to themselves,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and find their way out of
destructive relationships.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
That's another very
important issue.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's a lot of
abuse that you say is going

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
on in our society.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's child abuse, sexual
abuse, or emotional abuse,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
we're allowing ourselves to
be in negative relationships.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because we feel
too guilty and because we

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have any way out
of these relationships.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
destructive entanglements

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
become bondages that are
addictions in themselves,

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and so a person can
become an addiction.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You hear of people,
women especially,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
going through abusive
relationships,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and then they get out of it, and
then they go back to the abuser

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
again and keep on
repeating the same cycle,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.613 align:middle line:90%
repeating the same pattern.

00:18:54.613 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There really isn't anything
we can do about the abuser.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is
outside of our control.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we can take
control of our lives again,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.550 align:middle line:84%
surrender, let go,
and we can get out

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:90%
of that negative relationship.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's our
responsibility to ourselves.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But most of us have been
brainwashed by society

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to feel that we have
to stay with people

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and heal them when
that is totally wrong.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> But we can't.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:90%
We can't fix them.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe create a space for
another person to become better

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
or to heal themselves and we
cannot harm another person,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
but you really can't fix
the other person, can you?

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
right, Georgia.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
take our power back,

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
we have to realize
that, and then

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
assume our responsibility
to our own selves

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and take our focus
off the other person

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and put our focus
on our own pain.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have in the
back of the book--

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and I really like it.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
In the appendix,
you have all sorts

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
of affirmations and meditations
and positive things,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and you make reference to
the awakenings that we have,

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
the passages of time
that you call something

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
the path of life chart.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
What is that that
we're going through?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The path of life chart came
to me when I was sitting out

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
by the water in the
back of my house.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, God
started speaking to me,

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and I ran and got a pencil,
and I started writing it down.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And [CHUCKLES] that
path of life chart

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
started to be written down
as an expression of how

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
we are whole at birth and
totally in touch with life

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and have an open heart and how
through our painful experiences

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:84%
with our parents in childhood,
start to lose part of ourselves

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and then grow up and
attract those same types

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
of parental figures
into our lives

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
until we reach a point in
life where we're in denial,

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's when tragedy and
crisis comes into our lives.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have set
up a pattern then.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and living
life based on fear instead

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of the trust and love that
will move us forward in life.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.985 align:middle line:84%
>> And the good news is we
can move forward in life.

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:06.785 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:06.785 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And that is the good news.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really want to
convey, is that we can change

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and we can change our lives.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Life is not meant to be about
suffering, that we are meant--

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
for the soul to find its
own joy in our lives,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
but we have forgotten that.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to remember,
we have to close our eyes

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and go within and take the next
step in our evolution, which

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is opening the heart and feeling
the feelings that will connect

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
us to God, so we can all
become divine children

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and have an expression of
life that is one of love

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and self-esteem and happiness
instead of this suffering that

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
is so prevalent in
our world today.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
That is so well said.
