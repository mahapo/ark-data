00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill, and
we have a very special program

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.770 align:middle line:10%
for you.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We do have the honor of having
with us two wise men of Peru.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.870 align:middle line:84%
They are bringing the
ancient teachings to us,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the condor
coming to the eagle.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:38.903 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.903 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
We have had programs
where we have

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
been able to introduce to you
some of the major religions

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It is always wonderful to
go back to the ancient times

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and know how those traditions
and those religions

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:90%
are really helping us today.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And it is an honor to have with
us two gentlemen from Peru, who

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
have brought the wisdom
and the tradition

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.263 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient anchors and
through today, the gifts

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
that they are sharing.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
welcome both of you.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It is wonderful
to have you here.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
We have Dr. Theo Paredes
who is the anthropologist.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have Ruben Orellana,
who is the archaeologist.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have been
trained in the academics,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
but your heart is with the
teachings that you have learned

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
healing traditions.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Is this so?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Peru is a
particular country,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
like also Ecuador and Bolivia,
and some other countries like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
even Mexico, I
think, and here, too,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
where the old culture
is still alive.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Particularly in
Peru, we might say

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that maybe 60% of
the population are

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
natives, which are the direct
descendants from the Inca time.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We still speak the Quechua,
which was the main language

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So before we went to
a school or before we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
went to start our teachings
from the academy--

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> --all this wisdom and
knowledge were surrounding

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:90%
So we grow with it.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, as children it
was part of your life.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of our culture,
our life, our tradition.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we went into the
university, the only thing,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
we start to put some frames
to see what was going on,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:90%
but it is part of our life.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So the culture of your
country and the history

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Incans and so forth
then actually was just framed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
through your work
at the university.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
what I think, too.

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:55.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, we do have a map of Peru.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%
And both of you are from Cusco.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Cusco, yes.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is the capital.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's also known as
the Navel of the World.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that because it's center?

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but the
explanation from this,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
in some ways it comes
from two points.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:10%
One, that any culture,
any human group in order

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:10%
to start something new,
they look for a place,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:10%
for a center, from where they're
going to begin to organize what

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:10%
for them is the chaos.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So it became to
be the axis mundi.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one explanation.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The other one is that
people who was before us,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
they were more
related with nature,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
with the laws that
commanded nature.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were looking
for a place such as Cusco,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
which is a vortex of energy.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> A vortex?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a power center, sure.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So they called
this the navel.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were long ago
ahead of what is going on now,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
because also the Dalai
Lama says years ago

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that the center of
energy of this planet

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
has been changing or
moving from the Himalayas

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:90%
into the Andes area.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So it confirms that these
people knew where they were

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
looking in order to make
a settlement to start this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, well, we have been
hearing about Machu Picchu

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:10%
as being one of those places
that people are drawn to.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:10%
They absolutely
love Machu Picchu,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and we have a picture here
of the Andes behind it.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And Machu Picchu is one
of those power centers

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.886 align:middle line:90%
that people are drawn to.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Machu Picchu is a crystal city.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Crystal city, yes, uh-huh.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the geological
composition of this place is

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
the white granite stone.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And we when you take the
granite stone, you find quartz.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Like [INAUDIBLE] inside
there's a composition

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:90%
to this geologic area.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu with
this is very special,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
because you find
a lot of crystals

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
in the walls, in the floor,
and everyplace around.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And the crystals move
a very special energy

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:90%
with high frequency.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And Machu Picchu, too,
is in a very high place.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And around you have
the many, many apus.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
"Apu" in our language,
that's ceremonial hills.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And each one, too,
is a vortex of energy.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Picchus, that is the
original name to the city,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:90%
not Machu Picchu.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Just Picchu.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Machu Picchu is the
name to the one hill.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Picchus in general, because
around you find all these

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:90%
hills.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Each one is a vortex of energy.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You are more or
less in the middle

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to this energy from this
area close to Cusco.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, your responsibility
in your job is that you are

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
a consultant, and you
work with Machu Picchu.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You have found additional
information about it

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
as you have studied?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, years ago,
many years ago,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I am the chief archaeologist
from Machu Picchu from this

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:90%
national park.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But I started my
archaeology work in 1975,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
in exploring and digging
in this national park.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And in 1987, I discovered
a new archaeological site

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
around to Machu Picchu, because
the information about the city

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
is referenced is the
last city of the Incas.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> The last city of the Incas.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In some way,
but it's not true,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
because around you find
many a small village.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And to Machu Picchu
come in seven Inca trails.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not only one.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I explore, and
I find one more

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to connect the Urubamba Valley
to the next valley is Lucumayo.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a nice,
beautiful Inca trail.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
This are the proof it's
not an isolated city.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.765 align:middle line:84%
This city is in connection
with many others.

00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have some Incan art,
which is absolutely beautiful.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm thinking about
with what you have said,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and here we have some of the
Incan art that has been found.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Naymlap.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Naymlap is the figure
which is in the left side now.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the gods
from the north of Peru.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> He is like the Viracocha,
who was a wise man who came.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
He's a mythical
hero, that he came.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And he started to teach all
the knowledge to our people.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
This Naymlap is from
the north part of Peru.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And he came, and
he made a kingdom,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
which name was Yampellec,
which now became Lambayeque

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:90%
in Spanish, that we Lambayeque.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.275 align:middle line:84%
And for us, the
hero was Viracocha.

00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:24.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I've seen then,
from what you're talking about,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:84%
too, the crystal city has
the crystals buried in it.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So there's still the beauty
of the natural environment,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.002 align:middle line:84%
but then there is some
of the wonderful artworks

00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
from the Incas that
you still have,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
too, that are probably
in the museum in Cusco?

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
And something which
makes us very proud

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
is that recently,
there has been--

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
well, not so recently,
but maybe 10 years ago,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
they found what
the archaeologist

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
has been calling the
second most important

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:90%
find after Tutankhamen.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very, very big find
about the Senor of Sipan,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:90%
the Lord of Sipan.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Which really was a huge
pyramid, a clay pyramid.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And under 14 meters, they
found this royal tomb,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
which is very, very impressive,
with all these ceremonial--

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:90%
with all these people around.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
digging and finding more.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
They call now the
second Lord of Sipan,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:90%
which were in this big pyramid.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the second
to Tutankhamen's.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's very impressive.

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very impressive.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I mentioned at the
beginning of this,

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:90%
the condor and the eagle.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And there is the prophecy
that South America represents

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
the condor or the heart,
and North America the eagle

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and the head, and that there
is a message that is coming,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
as the Dalai Lama
had said, there's

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
so much power now in the Andes.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
But do you feel that there is
like a message of love that

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
is coming from South
America to North America,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and that's why people are
so thrilled to have you here

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:90%
with us doing your teaching?

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> That something is
happening we cannot deny.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That some changes in
the mentality of the world,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:90%
it's happening.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
We can see this.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Even now, we call a new age.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:24.444 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so it's not because we
just are the new generation,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
who has more consciousness
about the Earth or whatever.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I think we have such
a biological clock

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in our body, which
move according

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:90%
to the time with the Earth.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we are linked
to the Mother Earth.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time for us to open
this biological Clock that's

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:84%
why we are looking and searching
for this spiritual growth,

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.462 align:middle line:90%
because the new time is coming.

00:11:00.462 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mentioned the condor,
and you have a beautiful--

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and if you would
show us the condor.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
You have a symbol.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.267 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that
the condor represents?

00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you could hold it
up so that we can see it,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely beautiful.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is a shell, a
[INAUDIBLE] shell which has

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:90%
been carved.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It maybe has 800 or 900
years old, this piece.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you can see from one
side and from the other side.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's absolutely gorgeous.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And for us in our cosmic
vision, we have three levels.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:90%
We have an inner world.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
We have this world.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:90%
And we have a high level world.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But in this, in the inner world,
is the cosmic womb, the Mother

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Earth, where everything
is transformed.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes back there
and becomes something new.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I wanted to--

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:90%
we're going to take a break.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I thought
was such a blessing

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
is that at the beginning of--
before we started this show,

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you actually did a blessing,
and you did a chanting,

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and you brought in
the energies for us.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We want to talk more
about that energy, too.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:90%
But we need to take a break.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay tuned,
we will be right back

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.622 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient
teachings of the Andes.

00:12:24.622 --> 00:12:26.982 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:26.982 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:10%
If you are just
joining us, we have

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:10%
been talking with two
of the wise men of Peru,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:10%
an anthropologist
and archaeologist,

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and they were explaining
to us about the condor.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is a consciousness that
is the higher consciousness.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And bridging the world between
the physical and the spiritual,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
all of us want to be raised to
that higher consciousness that

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:90%
is represented by the condor.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And we are so pleased
again, Theo and Ruben,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:90%
to have you with us.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking about the
shaman and the teachings that

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:90%
are so ancient.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.192 align:middle line:84%
And you said that's
just one of the tribes,

00:13:02.192 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
but we have the Q'ero, you
said are the most well known

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:90%
of the shaman of Peru.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to remember
the name to the Inca empire.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
The name of the Incan
empire is the Tawantinsuyu.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Tawan is "four".

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Suyus are regions.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is the empire
to the four regions.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And you have many
different ethnic groups

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
in this moment in Peru, in
between to Peru and Bolivia.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And all these knowledges from
the Inca and pre-Inca time come

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
with oral tradition.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And you have many
different communities.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:10%
You have the Q'eros.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
They handle all these knowledges
and preserve some tradition

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:90%
from the Inca time.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:10%
But you have other group,
too, very important

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:10%
around the Titicaca Lake.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the Collas.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And here in this place, the
priests, the name to the priest

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:90%
is Kallawayas.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.907 align:middle line:84%
In general, descent is
from all these persons,

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:90%
this is the shamans.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But in our country,
each one have a name.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> In Quechua, that is a paqo.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:90%
In Aymara, that is Kallawaya.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have the same,
too, in the jungle.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
jungle, you have all

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:90%
the different ethnic groups.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Like these people is
working, too, with the plants,

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
medicine plants of the jungle.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have the same
because these places,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.635 align:middle line:84%
these Incan places
are really huge.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And now it's in different
countries, right?

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:90%
You have Edcuador.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You have Peru.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:90%
You have Bolivia and Chile.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Chile,
you have the machis.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a woman.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.535 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a shaman woman.

00:14:41.535 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, the shaman woman.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just gonna ask you, if you
were to define it in English,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:90%
how would you define shaman?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it the holy man?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Is it the healer?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it the teacher, in
the case of the woman?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
In each of the oral traditions
that are passed down

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.618 align:middle line:84%
through the time
of the Incas, each

00:15:01.618 --> 00:15:03.035 align:middle line:84%
have come to the
different tribes.

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:90%
And what is the shaman?

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:90%
What is their role?

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the shaman is the
man who has been reaching two

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:90%
things--

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
the harmony in himself,
and the harmony between him

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and the nature and
environment worlds.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I see.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's the one who can
share this with other people.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Because healing, health,
good luck, whatever you name it,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:90%
it is nought but our money.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
If everything's in harmony,
everything fits in its place.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> If it is in harmony.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> There was an absolutely
beautiful blessing that you

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
gave us, and we do
have it on tape.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You could not begin the
program without the blessing

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
of the space, and
can you tell us?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be pulling up a
tape here of what we had done.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
We have the mesa, is
what it is called.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.795 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the layout
of the crystals and things.

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about what

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:90%
we're going to see on this?

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
We think that the Mother
Earth is a live being.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we go, we
don't have frontiers.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't have borders.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:90%
We are yes in the Mother Earth.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But each place
has its own energy,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:90%
its own spiritual energy.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we take
for granted that we

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
are the owner of this property
or the owner of this land,

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:90%
we are not owners of nothing.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We are just here
to share what we have.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> This beautiful planet, this
beautiful time that we call

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:90%
our life.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we live in
the past and in the future.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:90%
We doesn't exist.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The past is already gone,
and future doesn't exist.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to live in the present,
which is our best gift.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
call it "present."

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
So we open this mesa with
these little objects, which

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
carry some kind of energy, or
it has been from the elders

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.100 align:middle line:90%
like this condor.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So with this, we ask in this
space to the energy that is

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
handed this space
to allow us to work.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
We ask for the permission
to sit here, to be with you,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and to bless all of
us, or everything

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
that we are doing here.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And it is not but to reach
with the chanting and with this

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
object some
frequencies of energy,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
so we can reach in this
level with our feeling.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes our mind
goes faster, but when

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we start to learn our
self, our intuition,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
we start to perceive that there
is something more than that.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's this ceremony,
basically what has been done.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Opening this space for us.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, as I told you,
we usually begin each

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
of our programs with a prayer.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:90%
But you did that so beautifully.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You created a sacred
space here for all of us

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:90%
in blessing this area.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was all
also, you said, as

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
if you were asking
permission to share,

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
but you had to first
bless the area.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And the chanting and
the rhythm, that has--

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We have this kind of perfume,
that we call this florida

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.920 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you go to any
place and you have flowers,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or you put perfume, you are
talking about frequencies.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Perfumes come in frequencies.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you spray
wherever you go this perfume,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.060 align:middle line:90%
you change the frequency.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's very nice
to have flowers.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice to have perfume.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice to smile.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Because then you start
to change the energy which

00:19:04.947 --> 00:19:06.072 align:middle line:90%
surrounds you.

00:19:06.072 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.207 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
spraying of the water was,

00:19:09.207 --> 00:19:10.457 align:middle line:90%
the florida, the flower water.

00:19:10.457 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And the rattling,
and the rattling,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
it is because man has been
discovering that through

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the rattle, through drums, and
the voice are able to change

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies, and it's
able to reach into you.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't know why
we give a rattle to a baby.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And say, OK, give
a rattle to a baby.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And the baby starts
to rattle them.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And they say, OK, it gets
calm, and it gets happy.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't know that the
baby when it's rattling is

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
changing the frequency of
energy around it, around them.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:90%
So they become calm.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how it works.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, now, see, I had never
thought of the baby rattle,

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:90%
but it does.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It changes that energy.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about so much today

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:90%
really is energy, isn't it?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And the healing energy
and this whole idea

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of the energy that both of
you create where you go.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
people are so honored

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to have you come and share
your wisdom with them.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We share what somebody
else has been sharing with us.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think also, and here
here's the beautiful mesa

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:90%
is what you call the lay.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wish we could have
even seen how beautifully you

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:90%
set each piece at its place.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And each one, I'm sure, has a
very special and sacred aspect

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to IT a purpose
that it fulfills.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the mesa
is like the cosmos.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In your mesa, you can
represent all the cosmos.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:84%
You have the left side,
you have the right side,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:90%
you have the middle part.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.622 align:middle line:84%
So you have the left
side, which is the past.

00:21:05.622 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You have the middle part,
which is the present.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have the right
side, which is the future.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But then you have
four directions,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
which is the four
directions of the universe,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:90%
which is the four seasons.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And you have a middle part.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle part is
the center, where you are.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And this center is connected
with the inner world,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:84%
with the Mother Earth, and
with the Cosmic Father.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:90%
And you are in between of them.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been an
absolute blessing,

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and I am so honored to have
had you with your ancient

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
teachings, sharing
with us today.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, Rube.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.265 align:middle line:84%
>> And we would love to have
you be in touch with them.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you will
stay tuned, we'll

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.954 align:middle line:84%
let you know how
you can do that.

Richard Bassil is our contact

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:10%
and he was kind enough
to bring them to us.

are coming here to the United
