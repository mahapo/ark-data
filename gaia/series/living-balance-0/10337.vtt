00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want to welcome you
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:84%
We are in our series of the
great religions of the world.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And we do have the Swami
Yogeshwarananda with us today

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:10%
who has a foundation
in Hinduism,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:10%
but also has studied all of the
great religions of the world.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:10%
And I've asked him to
share with you nirvana.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So come join us, "Living
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Every year or two, we
are treated with a visit

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
from the Swami Yogeshwarananda.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:10%
He does come to our area by
way of, this time, Switzerland

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.070 align:middle line:10%
and then California.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we are very honored
to have him with us.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Swami.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you very much.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I have asked if you would
share today on the subject

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
of nirvana.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:10%
And you said, well,
with your background

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:10%
and having studied both
Buddhism and the Hinduism,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:10%
which approach what I like.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And I said, tell us
both, how they are alike

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.262 align:middle line:10%
and how they are different,
and what is nirvana?

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, nirvana means a
state of enlightenment.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You get to your own blessing
state of existence in which you

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
experience a state of wonderful
beingness, which is so distinct

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and cut away from our normal,
human empirical existence

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
That's a state wherein you
experience total bliss wherein

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
you get to know everything.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:90%
You're all-knowing.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And you are absolute
in your existence.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
When I use the word
absolute, it means

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that you are self complete
in every sense of the term.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Swami, are we all
striving toward nirvana?

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Are some people
aware that they are?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Is that a goal of
the human condition?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes that is the final
goal and the final state.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is, most of us

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
are going through
it unconsciously,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
while a few who have
understood the significance

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of human existence tend
to proceed towards it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
more consciously and
want to accelerate

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
their movement towards it.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in talking with someone
about the basics of Hinduism,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
they were explaining that some
people are bad and act badly.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people are good and
their behavior is good.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:90%
And then there is the devoted.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Now if you were to look
at people like that,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:10%
is it the devoted that
are aware that they

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.645 align:middle line:10%
are on this journey
toward enlightenment?

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Not necessarily.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you get
a wide spectrum

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:90%
in the human character.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who are
proceeding towards nirvana

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are
more truth conscious

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
or who are devoted
with all their heart

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and being in trying
to experience

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
the state of nirvana, or
the enlightened state.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.871 align:middle line:84%
You may call it the
godly state of beingness.

00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Now when we have talked
about nirvana before,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:10%
some people have explained
it, there are no real lows,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:10%
there are no real highs.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:10%
It is a middle road.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, where is the definition of
that being at that middle road?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
You make it sound
absolutely blissful.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact, the way
towards it is the middle path.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Lord Buddha very beautifully
termed it as the middle path.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is a psychological
middle path, not

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:90%
the physical middle part.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But the psychological
state wherein

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:90%
you maintain your balance.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're leading a very
balanced and serene way

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.165 align:middle line:84%
of living, which will
eventually lead you to nirvana.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So our show could be,
instead of living in balance,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.974 align:middle line:90%
we could just be nirvana.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that is right.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's like the ultimate
goal of the living in balance

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
would be defined or
explained as nirvana.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact he's very
intriguing to know that that is

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the definitions given
in the "Bhagavad Gita" 2,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the middle path, wherein it
mentions Samatvam Yoga Uchyate,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that means the state
of mental equipoise,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
or the state of mental balance
with which one is living

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
one's life is the way
or the road to nirvana.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we sometimes
drift in and out of it?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we sometimes
experiencing it?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we go
back to the mundane

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
or we are still
learning our lessons?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it a place that
you are always?

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Or do you drift back and forth?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at the moment, we
are not drifting into it.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But what we are doing
is that basically we

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
are from a human perspective
or human level of living,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:90%
at times we are balanced.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
The human race is balanced.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
Individuals are balanced.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And very often they
are imbalanced too.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But the whole key
or the whole idea

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is that one should keep on
living our life in a very

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
balanced, serene, calm
manner so that eventually

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and finally we would get into
that ultimate state of balance

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Would we stay here in
this plane, in this planet,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.946 align:middle line:84%
in this life if
we reach nirvana?

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> When you reach nirvana,
what happens is that the whole

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
universe collapses
and disappears.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And a intriguing
question arises.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
If the whole universe
disappears, then where are we?

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But the remarkable thing
is, the whole universe

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
is or exists in
space and time where

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:90%
there is movement and change.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
While the state of
nirvana is that which

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is beyond space, wherein
there is no time,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and wherein there is no
movement, because it is full,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.044 align:middle line:84%
it is total, it is
absolute, beingness.

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Now are you then, because
you have devoted yourself--

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and let's tell, some people
have not met you before,

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
so we have to know your story.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I refer to you as the
Swami from Sri Lanka.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, which used to be Ceylon.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So, Sri Lanka.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:10%
And from there, that's
where you were born,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:10%
but you really did
your spiritual work

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:10%
in the Himalayas.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:10%
Tell us a little bit
about your journey

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.435 align:middle line:10%
that brought you to this
understanding of nirvana.

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was young,
I was a seeker after truth,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
what the truth of
life is all about.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, by God's grace, I
got into the spiritual life

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and went over the Himalayas to
live the life of a hermit monk.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And during the
course of my life I

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
began to appreciate and
understand the purpose of life

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and what the state of
nirvana is all about

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and how to proceed towards that.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.815 align:middle line:90%
And that has been my life.

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well according
to your resume,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:90%
it was 25 years that you spent.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's about 35 now.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> 35 now.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And you actually did
then, as an ascetic,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.565 align:middle line:90%
you spent time in the cave.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
You actually spent time in not
poverty, but without support,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
except from the
generosity of the people.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that how the ascetic lives?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right in fact, the
support structure of the Indian

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
society is very congenial and
conducive to lead the life

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:90%
of a hermit or an ascetic.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
The society is very
supportive and recognizes

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
people who sought and to
lead a spiritual life.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of
it what happens

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is that, who knows
out of 1,000 hermits

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
one could flower out into
a beautiful holy being

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:90%
who has attained nirvana.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And so just in case,
the people then

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:84%
are willing to support the
lifestyle of the monks.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.569 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:10%
>> But what you've said is
that Hinduism is the basis

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:10%
for your philosophy.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:90%
But why did you go beyond that?

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.332 align:middle line:84%
What was it about you
as a seeker of the truth

00:08:47.332 --> 00:08:49.415 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted to know
the other great religions?

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we don't confine
ourselves to any particular

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We make access to the available
knowledge found in the world.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it is only
right and proper that we

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
go into all traditions
from which one

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
could derive the maximum
input and knowledge

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And the remarkable thing is that
what has been briefly mentioned

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:84%
in one tradition, certain
aspects get better

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
explained in another tradition.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And what has been mentioned
in a third tradition, just

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
only merely being just given
a simple passing reference,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
gets well-expounded
in another tradition.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So it is therefore very good
to go into all traditions

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.836 align:middle line:84%
so that one could become
the richer for it.

00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And so that was your approach.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, I had no bias or
particular inclination towards

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:90%
any particular religion.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I was not concerned of
religion, not in the least.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
All that I was concerned was
to know what the truth of life

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So I broke the religious
barrier when I was young itself,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
as I had no interest
in religion,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
but only in God and
the truth of life.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh I see.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So with a religion
meaning a structured place

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
or with a religion with
certain dogmas, certain rules,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
you were only looking
for what you considered

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to be what was the truth.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What was the truth.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> The wisdom.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Because a religious
structure encompasses

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
many facts, many features,
its theological doctrines,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
its ritualistic approach,
its belief system,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
which may be relevant
or non-relevant,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and its varied practices, which
equally also may be relevant,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
may not be, its
conventions and practices.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I was concerned of was
the truth it was bringing out,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.395 align:middle line:90%
the final truth of life.

00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Now the one book that were
mentioned first is a book that

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:10%
then was an outgrowth of this
wisdom that you had gained,

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:10%
and it is called "The
Yoga for Understanding."

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes "The Yoga
of Understanding"

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is an explanatory commentary
on a chapter of the "Bhagavad

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Gita" wherein wisdom
knowledge is brought out.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the first thing
that usually a person,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual seeker
or a truth seeker

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.635 align:middle line:84%
should seek for is
wisdom and knowledge.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I was going to ask you,
I know that you've spent all

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:10%
those years in the
cave and so forth,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:10%
but might it be possible for
us to take a few shortcuts

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:10%
to enlightenment, some
techniques that might help.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay tuned,
we will be back with Swami

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and some steps
toward enlightenment.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
If you are just joining
us, we are talking

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:90%
with the Swami Yogeshwarananda.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
He is philosopher
and he is author.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Three of his books
that we have we're

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about,
in addition to our techniques

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:90%
toward enlightenment.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And of those three books
that we have mentioned

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that he is the author of, he has
shared his wisdom in his life

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:90%
as he has traveled the world.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is what he
determined was his role when

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.985 align:middle line:90%
he left the Himalayas.

00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And how did you know
you were to write?

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Was it just time was
that as the author?

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact, each one
expresses his own nature.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So when the time has
come, you give expression

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to what you understand
and what you know.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had mentioned
the first book.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was what I
mentioned the title,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:90%
"The Yoga for Understanding."

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And you said no, it is "The
Yoga of Understanding."

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And you might even
have changed the title.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact,
understanding, yes,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
it's a yoga of understanding.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:90%
One has to understand.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And order for the
understanding to transpire,

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:90%
one requires wisdom knowledge.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So we could even say it's
a yoga of wisdom knowledge.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:53.587 --> 00:12:55.545 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you said
we must acquire first.

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> First.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So that is our homework then.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.803 align:middle line:84%
In fact, once you have
the wisdom knowledge,

00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
you would know where to
proceed and how to proceed.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.773 align:middle line:84%
And where you are and
what you are right now.

00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So after wisdom and knowledge,
then we move to the action.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.735 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the words
for action, is it karma?

00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:16.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And people have a
misunderstanding too of karma.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were to define
that, again, for us,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked you
this before, karma is--

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Karma is a very wide word.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
We could say that it's a series
of life experiences and life

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:90%
actions that we go through.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.895 align:middle line:84%
In life, it could
be said to be karma.

00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we use it in the
Western sense, we'll say, well,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:90%
that's your karma.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
As you sow, so shall you reap.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's a result of
the action that you

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:90%
take is what happens after.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But the laws which govern
the karmic effects on people

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:90%
is far more complex than that.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not merely an action
and reaction as it is popularly

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the cause and effect.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it's
used in the West,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%
but it's much wider than that.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more wider than that.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.673 align:middle line:84%
It's not only used in
the Western tradition,

00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%
but in the Asian tradition too.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it's some far
more complex than that, wherein

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
the entire human character
is brought out to be unfolded

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
in the scheme of living life.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And that which governs
and regulates them,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the factors is, of
course, the cause and effect.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But there is another factor
which is even more strong.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is each person's
psychological makeup,

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
which is also a very
great contributing factor

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
towards the unfoldment
of karmas in one's life.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I remember I asked you.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was so pleased with
your explanation of dharma.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I understood it then
to mean that our dharma was

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
our purpose, was our gift,
was our natural talent,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and what we were supposed to
express here in this lifetime.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a law of being for each
individual as per his nature.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the
individuals law of being.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Law of being, which is unique
to each person as each person

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is so uniquely structured
in character differently.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So as they are trying to
find their purpose in life,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
if they know what
their law of being is,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
then personally then they
can fulfill that purpose.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in order to know
what their law being is,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
first of all, they must
understand themselves.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So they have to psychoanalyze
and understand themselves.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So the process
of psychoanalyzing

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and understanding oneself is
wherein you become your own

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:90%
guru.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And thereafter you
could guide yourself.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Because who is the person
who knows yourself best?

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It's yourself.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So who could guide
yourself the best?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It is you.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Tell me of the message
in one of your other books,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:10%
"Mind and the State of No-Mind--

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:10%
the Journey into the Self."

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:10%
Is that part of our
purpose being here?

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:10%
Must we always learn to
know ourselves again?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:10%
In fact, from the mind, we
get to the state of no-mind.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And the state of no-mind
and the state of nirvana,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
wherein you transcend the mind,
transcend existing in a body,

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.831 align:middle line:90%
and you go beyond the mind

00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:24.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> But we must start first.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So through the mind, you
proceed beyond the mind.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.011 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to the no-mind
state, you lose your mind.

00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's good.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very good.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we reach "The
Wholistic View of Life."

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
We look at life differently.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's another one of
your books, "The Wholistic

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
View of Life."

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact, the wholistic
view means that in order

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to have a perspective and
a vision of the whole,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:90%
which is the one truth.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So once you have a
vision of that one truth,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
thereafter you could meditate
on it or the final truth

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and experience it, realize
it within yourself.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
So for that the vision of the
whole, vision of the one truth,

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.546 align:middle line:84%
has to be discerned
as to what it is.

00:17:13.546 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let us go back just
a moment to the nirvana,

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
because how would you express
from your studies of the great

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:84%
world religions the difference
between the Hindu and Buddhist

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:90%
perspective of nirvana?

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact, a very
slight emphasis is given,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:90%
though it's one and the same.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhist word is nirvana.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:90%
The Hindu word is nirwana.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
While the Buddhists tend to
give it a negative connotation,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the Hindus are a little more
positively affirmative on it.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So as the Hindus stated more
on a positive basis as absolute

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
bliss, while the emphasis in the
Buddhistic tradition is that it

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:90%
is the emptying of the universe.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
The universe is not there,
nor is the individuality

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:90%
of the person.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So neither the individual,
the so-called individual soul

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:90%
is not there.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
The person who aspires
for nirvana, when he

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
attains nirvana, is not there.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Then at the same time,
along with the person,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the individual, the universe
is a counterpart of his,

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:90%
it's a counter opposite of his.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So the universe too, it
fizzles and disappears

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
at the time of nirvana.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So at the state in nirvana,
neither the universe

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
nor the individual
is there, but a state

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of beingness which is
beyond these two is there.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that is
mentioned or indicated

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Buddhistic tradition.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
While in the Hindu
tradition, it's a little more

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
positively affirmed
and stated that nirvana

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is the state of absolute
existence, absolute knowledge

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.525 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and
absolute bliss.

00:18:55.525 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So something one
would want to attain.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And I asked you if there are
any shortcuts to enlightenment

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.305 align:middle line:84%
and nirvana and
bliss, or techniques.

00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I was being a little silly.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are shortcuts
and there are no shortcuts.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the shortest cut
is to keep quiet, be still,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and know thyself.

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you can be mentally
silent, mentally quiet,

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that state of quietness
we lead you to nirvana.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, when
all the agitations

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and the agitations
of the heart subside, then one

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:90%
enters nirvana.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
So that is a short way--

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to keep quiet.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So one must then
find that quiet place.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Quietness within oneself.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And if we hear that chatter.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a matter
of practicing?

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Can you get better at it?

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to just have
intention and put your energy

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
to that?

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.423 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:58.423 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We must consciously
make an effort

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to put a stop to
our mental chatter

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and to get into a
meditative state.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
In a meditative
state, you become

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
acutely or consciously
aware of the truth of life,

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.505 align:middle line:90%
which is there within you.

00:20:12.505 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, just very briefly,
we have a few minutes left.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
As a swami, you
are a vegetarian.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you don't need
to do all the Hatha yoga.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, not at all, not at
all because spiritual life is

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:10%
primarily a mind science.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And it deals with the
mind, go beyond the mind.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But your exercise,
you love to walk.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Just because you love to walk?

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.705 align:middle line:84%
And it's good for the
body and the mind too.

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now as far as the robe,
everything you have on is

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
in the shades of the orange.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the orange
is the color of fire.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And fire purifies.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's symbolic.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So the symbolism then.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
then in the orange

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.695 align:middle line:84%
gives you that
reminder to yourself.

00:20:57.695 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you travel now, you
will leave us and you will go

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
home to Sri Lanka on
your way home to India.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in fact, I'll be passing
through Colombo on my way

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to India to the Himalayan
mountains where I live.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you are there, then
you'll be able to come back

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
from society into
your quiet place.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it easier to be
quiet in the Himalayas?

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because it's easier to
be quiet there because we have

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
no activity, at least some of
us don't have any activity.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore it's
very conducive

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:90%
not to be involved with society.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But to be by oneself is very
desirable in the long run

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.465 align:middle line:90%
to get into nirvana.

00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But we are very
pleased that you do

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
leave India annually
or every other year

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and come to share your
wisdom and your light.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to
be in touch with Swami,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
there is a telephone
number here in the States

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
that you can connect with.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And we would love to hear from
you at Shakhi-Hill Production.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:90%
So stay tuned.

In studying the great
religions of the world,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
it is really a
gift to have those

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
who have dedicated their
lives to an understanding

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge and the
wisdom come and share

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
their light with us.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
We are so pleased to
have had the Swami

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Yogeshwarananda with us.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are so glad that you
were there as our audience.

Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

happy, and peaceful.
