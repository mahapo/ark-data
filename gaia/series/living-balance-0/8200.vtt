00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia Shatki-Hill,
and I'd like

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.020 align:middle line:84%
to welcome you to "Living
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Today we will be meeting a
woman of vision, Jan Price.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
She has had a
near-death experience,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and she has been instrumental
in bringing healing meditation

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.680 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Come join us-- "Living in
Balance on Shatki-Hill."

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.053 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Jan Price is a woman of vision.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
She has written a
wonderful book that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
has shared some wisdom,
"The Other Side of Death."

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And also, she is
part of the energy

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
behind a global mind-link of
peace throughout the world.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Jan Price.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It is wonderful
to have you with us,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked you if you would
share some of this absolute

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
wisdom that you gained from
a near-death experience.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And the near-death experience
occurred, oh, what?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Three or four years ago?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:90%
Four and a half--

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
December the 30th, 1993
is my second birthday.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I've
been born again.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was truly probably
the most fabulous experience

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't change
it for anything.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I know something
now that I always believed,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.405 align:middle line:90%
but I know it now.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one thing that was
interesting about your having

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
gone to the other side, many
people who have written books

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
about it had not already
been on a spiritual path.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But you have spent
the last 20, 30 years

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
of your life on
a spiritual path,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and really probably
maybe a little bit more

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:90%
prepared for the adventure?

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:10%
It was not a shock to me
from the very beginning.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
As many others have experienced,
the first thing I realized--

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
first, I realized
that I was dead was

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
when I was above
the body observing

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:90%
what was going on down below.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And this didn't
surprise me at all.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I understand that others
who have had this experience

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
have found that
very frightening,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
because they had no idea
that they weren't the body.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've known for a long
time I'm not the body.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm much more than that.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So as I observed the EMS
attendants working on me

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and saying, gee, we've
lost her, I thought, oh.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in the body anymore.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.327 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be really
inconvenient for John,

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't know
where everything is.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I knew,
I was being lifted up

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
into this unbelievable
blue light.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
that blue light.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And just so-- for the
people who don't know,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
John is John Randolph Price.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
He is your husband and
your partner in life,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.893 align:middle line:84%
and you worried about
leaving him behind.

00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was like, he doesn't
know where everything is.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't have
everything in order.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Poor guy.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be tough.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.475 align:middle line:90%
He can't find it all.

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But you went to this
beautiful blue light,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and you said it
was this fabulous--

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like a sea of love.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It was complete and
utter contentment,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:90%
a feeling of wholeness.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I would have gladly
stayed there forever.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It was just moving into
this space that's divine.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then quickly,
golden rays of light

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:90%
started to move through it.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And they brought up memories
of a lifetime, little vignettes

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and scenarios from the moment
I was born all the way through,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and showed me some
patterns, guilt patterns

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and things that had contributed
to the heart attack, which

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:90%
is what I had--

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:90%
the massive heart attack.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, the
guilt had built up,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and eventually that caused
the arteries to clog.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.023 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- it showed
me how this happened.

00:03:53.023 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
things that we all

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
need to be aware of.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't hold on to
guilt. Of course,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
most of it's
subconscious, but we work

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:90%
on letting those feelings go.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.807 align:middle line:84%
>> So you saw the causes that
had brought you to that point.

00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So there was an awareness
that you already--

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
you were already in a learning
situation, and the blue light,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:90%
the gold light-- yes.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You could see it just
by showing you these little

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%
incidents through your life.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I moved into another space
that was brighter and clearer.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the most
wonderful thing happened.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
My dog, Maggie, who had
died three weeks earlier,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:90%
came to meet me.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.398 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know that even your
daughter questioned why would

00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:90%
the dog come to meet you?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, she says, don't
tell anybody that mother.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%
No one will believe you.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> But Maggie was love.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Maggie was unconditional
love, and you had not

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
released that connection.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Love comes out to greet you.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But she was my guide through
many, many dimensions.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we finally
realize is that there's not

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
There's lots and lots
of places to do life,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're all wonderful.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's an unending adventure.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And we go where we'll
be most comfortable.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll use that word
consciousness again.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
takes us to the place

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that is most suitable for us.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a sense, what I got is
you sort of then realized you

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:84%
had created what would be your
own kind of heaven that would

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.345 align:middle line:90%
be heavenly to Jan?

00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Or realm or level or dimension?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that's
one way to put it.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
You definitely--
consciousness continues

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to out-picture on every
plane of existence,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
just like it does here.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We create our own situations
in this physical world

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
where we are masquerading
as human beings.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
to us in life here

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
is based on our belief system.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing in
the other dimensions.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But you also went to
a beautiful place.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Was it the temple of knowledge?

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's it.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've never heard anyone
describe that before.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly enough, I found
someone else who's been there.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, there's
probably several.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
There is a International
Near-Death Society

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that has meetings
in different places.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And we heard of one
in Methodist Hospital

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
in San Antonio, which is where
they airlifted me after they

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:90%
brought me back to life.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we thought
we'd check that out.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And we went, and it was
a wonderful experience.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I found-- and this
relates back to your earlier

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
question about being
prepared for it--

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:90%
most aren't.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Most people are very frightened
about their experience.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%
They're confused about it.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It causes family
problems because people

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:90%
think they're nuts.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And as each one shared their
story, they came around me

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and they would-- tell us
what happened with you.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.785 align:middle line:84%
And this woman is
saying, oh, oh, oh.

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
She could hardly wait for me
to finish so she could say--

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, you went there, too?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
She said, yes.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:90%
What did it look like?

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So I described the temple of
knowledge that I had visited.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:90%
And she's shaking her head, yes.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
She'd been to the same place and
had the same experience, which

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
was wonderful for both of us.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:06.187 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
finding the phenomenon

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.180 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experience
is happening so much more

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
because of the abilities
of our medical people

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:90%
to bring people back.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
As these techniques have
developed over the years,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
they can bring people back if
they get to you soon enough.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think our 911 system
of handling emergency calls

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and the wonderful
medical technicians

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that are trained in these things
that can get to you quickly.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
had come to our house,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and we'd gone through
the death experience,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and they'd gotten the defib--
what do you call those electric

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
paddle things--

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Defibrillator.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --on me several times and
gotten the heart beating again,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:90%
they radioed for a helicopter.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And so they zoomed me
to the soccer field

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
at the high school, and
the helicopter landed.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And in just a few moments,
we were at the high school.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, even though
they brought me back,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
if they hadn't gotten me to
that heart center that quickly,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the story would
have ended differently.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So then there is a need
really for the groups to come

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
together of all of the people
who've had the near-death

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
experiences to share that, but
also for the people who are not

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable with and don't
have the family support.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.963 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there are even
conferences and gatherings.

00:08:28.963 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Helping them to understand
what's happened and to share

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.180 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, more and
more people are having them,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
and so it's becoming more known.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But there-- in the
past, years back, people

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
were afraid to talk about it.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's been happening forever.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Always, it's gone on.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the best
part of the other side?

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
What was the best part of your
having gone to the dimension?

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I suppose the greatest
adventure for me was the temple

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us more about that.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a beautiful,
white, Grecian-type building.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.792 align:middle line:84%
And it had many
arches around it.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I didn't even see
all of it, it was so huge.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But I-- there were many
paths approaching it.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I came into it, there
was sort of a porch area

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:84%
around it where
people were sitting

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in different groups talking
about different subjects.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And as I moved through
there, I could see, oh,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
there was a group of musicians
that were performing.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
There were writers
in a discussion.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, I would be
drawn to that group.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Different people doing
different things--

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
the creativity
continues whatever plane

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
you're on, because that's
our nature to be creative.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, too,
that on these planes,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
information is sort of sent
down into this physical plane

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that we live on, and
ideas are picked up

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
from people on other planes.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how many
inventions and discoveries

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.037 align:middle line:90%
and new philosophies develop.

00:10:11.037 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the same time in
different parts of the world,

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an energy
that comes then from above us

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and is put out there,
and different people

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:90%
can tune into it?

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.383 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:10:22.383 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:90%
That was a good explanation.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So many times, there will
be simultaneous inventions

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
or great discoveries at
different parts of the world

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:90%
by different people.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
They picked up on that
energy that's being sent down

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:90%
from another level.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But as I moved further into
the temple, there were--

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I call them wise ones--

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
people stationed at
different intervals.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of like you
could approach them and talk

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawn to
one in particular

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and did go and visit with
this beautiful, masculine-type

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing he said to me

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is, we know all your
questions, and you'll

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.813 align:middle line:90%
have all the answers.

00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You have all the answers.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'll have
all the answers.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you cannot know.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And I visited with
him for a while.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:10%
And then he suggested
that I move on

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:10%
into the center of the
temple and know for myself.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So I moved through various
shades of golden light

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
to a point where it just
became crystalline clear.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.045 align:middle line:90%
>> That just sounds beautiful.

00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a break,
and when we come back,

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you
came back to us

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
means that you had
something to share with us.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay tuned, we'll
be right back with Jan Price.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are just joining us,
we're talking with Jan Price,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
a woman of vision.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
She has been sharing with us
the adventure that she had

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%
in her near-death experience.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know why
you decided to come back,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and what else you learned
in your adventure there?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So what did you learn that
you needed to bring back?

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.908 align:middle line:84%
And what did you feel
as you were there?

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In the center of this
temple of knowledge that I was

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
speaking of earlier, I had the
experience of truly becoming

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
one with all that is,
that which we call God,

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.836 align:middle line:84%
of seeing my own
individual soul.

00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was awesome to know
how great and wondrous

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:90%
we truly are--

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
myriad lifetimes,
myriad experiences

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
on various planes
of life, and to know

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that this ongoing
activity of life

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
does never end for any
of us, and that we are

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:90%
more than this physical body.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We are more than the thinker
part, the brain computer.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a mind that's
much faster than that.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I feel now that
I came back to share

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
this to be an instrument of
love, an instrument of peace,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and a healer of
fear, so that people

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
can begin to dispel that
dread, that idea that we end

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and there's no more to us.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's maybe
the most important thing that

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:84%
happens when someone has
a near-death experience,

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
if someone re-experiences
a death in a past life,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:90%
the fear goes.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Because fear is so blocking to
our growth and to our feeling

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, fear is
what causes illness.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It's what causes any of the
maladies of the physical body,

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.972 align:middle line:84%
or any of the emotional
problems in life.

00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Any of these things is.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
We can let go of fear, and
the original fear was the fear

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:90%
that we would cease to be.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we realize
that that can't happen--

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.998 align:middle line:90%
>> That we don't cease to be.

00:14:03.998 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're a wonderful,
beautiful energy--

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The near-death experiences
that are happening

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and the other beautiful
spiritual openings that are

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
happening with people are
harbingers of what is to come

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
when we live as the true
light beings we really are,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and the way we were
in the beginning.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You see, death is not
a natural process.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:90%
It was never supposed to be.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But we created that, and so
it's something that we're--

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and we were supposed
to come and go at will.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we
did in the beginning.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll remember
and do that again.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And I came back to tell this.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the message,
then, is that there is love,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
that we can let go of the fear,
and that it's not a frightening

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:90%
experience at all.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other realm is
wonderful and beautiful.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, for people
who don't know you,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
you are the president/CEO
of Quartus Foundation.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about the work

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.227 align:middle line:84%
that you have been
doing before and after

00:15:01.227 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:90%
the near-death experience.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Quartus began
with John's first book--

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
my husband--

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:90%
"The Superbeings."

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't plan
to do Quartus,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but as he was writing
the book, he just

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:84%
intuited these words--
call your group Quartus.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he put it
in the manuscript

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
before it was going
to the printers,

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to have
this group called Quartus

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and to write for
information about it.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.604 align:middle line:90%
I said, you can't do that.

00:15:28.604 --> 00:15:29.812 align:middle line:90%
>> There isn't a Quartus yet.

00:15:29.812 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> There isn't a group.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm
supposed to do this.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I know I am, so it's going in.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what are we going
to do if someone wants to know?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'll
figure that out.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Letters started coming
in after people started

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
buying the books,
and so we realized

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
it was to be an organization
on spiritual research

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
and communication.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It's truly a shared experience
that we're all doing here.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're growing together and
understanding the more of us.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
Quartus is about.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And we did it through
books, through tapes,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:90%
through seminars.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We have a monthly Quartus report
that people can subscribe to.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:84%
We have healing groups
that work with others

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to come through any challenges
that they have in life.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And we have a lot of fun.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I saw-- what I've seen as
far as the different workshops

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.342 align:middle line:84%
that you offer, you really take
people at a beginning level who

00:16:27.342 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
are first taking
their first steps,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
but also the spiritual
research that you've done

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
has really opened you to some
very powerful, sophisticated,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
ancient wisdoms that
people can tap into, too.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Very definitely.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There is something that you
have done to change the world,

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and you need to share this.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:90%
World Healing Day.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, World Healing Day, which
I was so thrilled to be a part

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:90%
of the first one.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You were?

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm glad to know that.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.413 align:middle line:84%
And there are millions of
people who participated.

00:16:56.413 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about that.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's truly, of
course, an ongoing event.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But in 1983, we were
flying back from a workshop

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
we'd done in Alabama.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And on the plane, John just--

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
these ideas started
to come through it

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:90%
was time to do world service.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was working
on a book at the time

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:84%
that eventually became what we
call the Planetary Commission.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Planetary
Commission was the beginning

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:90%
of World Healing Day.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was for
people all over the world

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to come together at
the same moment in time

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
to release their
energy for the healing

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and harmonizing of this planet
and all forms of life hereon.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And we didn't think that
that might be a difficult thing

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
to do, because we
didn't think about it.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So John wrote the book, and
we went around telling people

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
these ideas.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And the first-- it was to be
on December the 31st of 1986

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
at noon Greenwich time, because
that's the only time that it's

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
the same day everywhere.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So we released the
idea to people.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But what was amazing is sort
of like maybe everybody had

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
something encoded in
their brain that went off

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
when they heard the
words, because it

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:90%
was a grassroots movement.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
People picked it up and
took it around the world.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it happened,
over 500 million people

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
came together on December
31, 1986 in Greenwich time

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to release their energies
for harmony and peace

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And they did it in many ways.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.608 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't say, this
is what you have to do it.

00:18:42.608 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
procedure you have to do.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, everybody,
do your own thing.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So we had 77 different
countries involved.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Every major religion to
some extent was involved.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:90%
And we had people in Red Square.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They surrounded
the Eiffel Tower.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.420 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii, they were sending
flowers out onto the water.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:84%
In Tahiti, sailboats
went out into the--

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
it was just an
unbelievable-- whole stadiums

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
were filled in our country,
here in the United States.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The King Dome in
Seattle was packed,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and whatever the
one is in Denver.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.737 align:middle line:90%
And we were just amazed.

00:19:24.737 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, well we gathered--

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It was awesome.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --on the Gulf of Mexico
in Fort Myers beach.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.008 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
probably a group

00:19:30.008 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:90%
of about maybe 20, 25 people.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was Tai Chi,
and there was just

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful
meditation in motion.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about that,
and here we are years later,

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:90%
and this is an annual event.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing was the
shift that happened worldwide

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:90%
toward peace and healing.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Berlin
Wall went down.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.173 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the breakup
of the Soviet Union.

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:90%
So there's all these things.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, people immediately
point out all the little wars

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:90%
that are going on.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But, you know,
those have to come up.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
They've been ancient
feelings of feuds and hatreds

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and resentments.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
As a spiritual energy comes
in, it pushes all the things

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.035 align:middle line:84%
unlike it to the surface so
that they could be healed.

00:20:19.035 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And they need to be, so
that's what is happening then.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:21.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They're playing out
those old things.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:90%
They are being released.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
That energy is being released
so that it can all be healed.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But groups have formed
around the world

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
doing wonderful things that
they weren't doing before.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to hear
these ideas from pulpits

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that would have never
spoken them before,

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:84%
from organizations and
governments that never thought

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
this way before.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And had you ever thought,
when you were on that airplane

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
flying back from Alabama, of how
overwhelming it would be from

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:90%
the very beginning?

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is an annual event.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes it is.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people call it a
Festival of Synchronicity,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because it is at the
same time, as you said,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
but a global mind-link
is the other way.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But it is the power of the
energy of all the people coming

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:90%
together for the same purpose.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It really is.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And some people do it by
themselves in their homes.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people come together with
organizations or other groups.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter how you do.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to this idea
that energy follows thought.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
What we're really doing
is we're sending energy

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
into the group-- race
consciousness, which

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:90%
starts to make a change there.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
It's lightening up.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:90%
It's brightening up.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The dark pockets
are being dissolved

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:90%
so that we can live in harmony.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely beautiful.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
You have served the planet
very well with that.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And we thank you, Jan Price,
for the beauty of what

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
you have done and the role
that you play with the Quartus

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, with the book
that you have shared, too.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, that is "The
Other Side of Death."

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have come back
to be our teacher.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And we would like
you to know how

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:84%
you can be in touch
with Jan if you would

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:90%
like at Quartus Foundation.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And we would love to
hear from you also

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
here, "Living in
Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:06.994 align:middle line:90%
So we will be right back.

>> So Jan Price has shared
her wisdom and her light.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:90%
She is a woman of vision.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
She has also brought
information to us

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
from a higher realm that
can help heal our lives,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and also working for the
planet on a daily basis, too.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
with us on Shakti-Hill.

May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
