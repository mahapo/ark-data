00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want to welcome you
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Once again, our arts
and entertainment series

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
brings to someone oh so
special, and from Scotland.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.350 align:middle line:90%
What a delight.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Today, Jean Redpath
sings just for you.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:84%
There is a quote from
"Edinburgh Times" that

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
said, "to call Jean
Redpath a Scottish folk

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
singer it's like
calling Michaelangelo

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:90%
an Italian interior decorator."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I loved that.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the pleasure of
having her with us today.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Jean Redpath.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.327 align:middle line:90%
I love that quote, too.

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that great.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.535 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, by this point, I
should have been paying that

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.905 align:middle line:90%
man royalties.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I read that.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's perfect.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And you are appreciated at home,
and here, around the world.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
I just keep moving.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:90%
That way, I can't be too sure.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and I read that you are
now in your 29th year of tour.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:10%
And you haven't
taken a stop yet.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:10%
You started in 1961.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.325 align:middle line:10%
And you're just on the road.

00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know, I'd prefer
not to think of that too much.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:90%
It's tiring.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Doing is fine.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:90%
But thinking about it is doing.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and I love the fact
that you go back to times with

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:10%
Bob Dylan in Greenwich Village.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of where
you started sharing

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
your music with America.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
He was just a little spindly
kid looking for a place

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to crash in New York at
the same time as I was.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.405 align:middle line:84%
But as they, say,
baby, look at us now.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but your
heart is in Scotland.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Your music is from Scotland.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I read, too, you have
made it your life's work

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to study the folklore, the
mythology, Scotland's history.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And you're a storyteller?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you said I
was appreciated at home.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
about my life's work.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Not so very long ago, one of the
old boys who has looked after

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
the family-- and he's
actually an optician--

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.755 align:middle line:84%
stopped me in the street
and said, oh, yeah,

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
you're home again, are you?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Home again.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Aye, aye.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Still singing?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, aye.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:90%
I told him I'm still singing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
He says, isn't now about
time you got a job?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not so sure about this
appreciation in Scotland.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Singing is not work.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And doing what you love,
of course, as you know,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
is not work, either.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I've never regarded
it as a life's work.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I stumbled into it.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And I liked it.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So I stayed there.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you just
had fun with it.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And also you've
loved the information

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
as you studied about the
history, the folklore.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And you just were
enthralled by it?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's-- well,
I grew up with it.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a source of
some of the most colorful

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:90%
expressions.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
To use one of hers, my
interest in the music,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't pay dear for it.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't pay very
much for the interest.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with it.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that's
been a problem, of course,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is I'm working with what is
basically a foreign language,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And out of that has developed a
performing style that gives me

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
a chance to make a
lot of commentary

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
about Scotland, to pass on
a lot of spoken information,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and also to translate what
I'm about to sing, or not.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
I were to launch

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
without explanation and sight
unseen into (SINGING) there

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
[SCOTS] never big nor small,
Montgomery's the farmer's name.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And the place is [SCOTS] Hall.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
[SCOTS]

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:10%
The dairy maid we have
the new is [SCOTS]..

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
For the milk she
milks in the morning.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:90%
By then, her time is [SCOTS].

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:10%
[SCOTS]

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:10%
(SPEAKING) After you get used
to tapping your feet to it,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:10%
you then start to wonder what
the blazes I'm singing about.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:10%
>> What did she say?

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a bothy ballad.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
It's off one of the farms
very close to where I grew up.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But your heart also lies
with much of the national

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:90%
bard's poetry and song.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's Robert Burns.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Indeed.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You have honored him.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And he has honored
you with his words.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.106 align:middle line:90%
And you have shared.

00:04:21.106 --> 00:04:23.356 align:middle line:10%
>> I think I may have known
the man at some point one.

00:04:23.356 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Of a kind.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:10%
He was a collector.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:10%
He was an author.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:10%
He was-- although
he never claimed

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:10%
to be-- a consummate musician.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Because he could
talk intelligently

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
about the vocal music,
the fiddle music,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
the pipe music of the late
18th century in Scotland.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you can ignore
the high profile--

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
he gets maligned for his
being a [INAUDIBLE],, you know?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he was one of the
very few of his class, I think,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
who actually owned the children
that he had outside of wedlock.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It was not-- it wasn't popular.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't fashionable
to do that.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> He was colorful.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> He was colorful.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:90%
He was also brutally honest.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:10%
But you said he had a real
sense of love and life.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And your music is about
love, and life, and death,

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and the stories,
yes, of Scotland.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, I have to share
that I just found out,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
with my niece doing
the family tree,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have some of
the Scottish in us.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I am part of
the McIntosh clan.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we call you
McShakti now, too?

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You may.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I loved about it,
which was so special to me,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:90%
is I have visited Scotland.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%
We went into Inverness.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was because I wanted
to spend time in Findhorn.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that's
where the family castle is.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
went home to Findhorn.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and I never knew.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
But I loved it, and I
just wanted to go back.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.483 align:middle line:84%
And we have gone
back different times.

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, that's
where the McIntosh

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
originated, apparently,
in that part of Scotland.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody should go
at least twice, Georgia.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the first time
is just a taste of it.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.485 align:middle line:84%
I say I'm an undercover agent
for the Scottish Tourist Board.

00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But a cue for a song,
lovely invitation

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to Scotland, to anybody
that wants to come there.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do have a
beautiful portrait of you.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have been honored in
your homeland, and in addition

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to being named in
the United States

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
a Kentucky Colonel by
the governor of Kentucky.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:90%
A BME is a--

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the MBE.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The MBE is a Member
of the British Empire.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and so that was
the Queen honoring you.

aside for actually all artists

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:10%
of one sort and another.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Shand, the great
Scottish country dance man,

Hugh MacDiarmid, the

The Nasmyth Burns
is in there, too.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But basically, you're a
scholar, educator, performer.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And you just love
to share the music.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And talk.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And talk.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And they say you're
a bit of a comedian.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, no, no, no, serious
to the end, to the end.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the other quote.

Scottish philosophy, you're
not here to have fun.

[CHUCKLES]

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, it's difficult
to explain sometimes why some

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
of the things come
out of a Scot's mouth.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And it has a great deal to
do with, for whatever reason,

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:10%
we have embraced a rather
punitive form of Puritanism

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.116 align:middle line:10%
or Presbyterianism.

00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
the basis for it

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is you're not here
to enjoy yourself.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be a
peculiarly joyless approach

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't approve at all.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But it does explain a
lot of the dry humor that

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%
comes out of Scots.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.408 align:middle line:84%
The humor is the driest thing
in the country, actually.

00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
If you've been there, you
know about the weather.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:90%
But we were very lucky.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:90%
We had beautiful weather.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Of course, that's nice.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but it--

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
as you watch and you see
all the beauty of Scotland,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and the Highlands,
and the way the clouds

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
just drift down and up

greenery, Georgia, it's mold.

>> Oh.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] It's beautiful mold.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:90%

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It has molded
beautifully, yes.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It's lovely.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And we have two of your CDs.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you have
30 or 40, but the two

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:10%
that are your latest
are "Now and Then"

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:10%
and "Still the Night."

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell me a little bit
about the music that Jean is

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
doing now today.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
What are these-- what are
you sharing with these?

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those are about as
different as chalk and cheese.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:90%
"Still the Night" is--

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:84%
for my sins, I was
asked to do a Christmas

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
program two or three years
ago at this point in New York.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the invitation
came through,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, wonderful,
I haven't tried that.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And it stopped me
dead in my tracks.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
There are no Scottish
Christmas carols.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it,
Christmas carols, by and large,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
are about Mary and the child
Jesus, which is, again,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:90%
basically Catholic in concept.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:84%
We had something called the
Reformation in Scotland,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
where the cult of Mary died
a death in the 16th century.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.632 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that, yes,
there were Christmas carols.

00:09:20.632 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And then in Middle Scots,
and most of the tunes

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:90%
have been lost.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Since then, we have
borrowed mostly

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.562 align:middle line:84%
from the English and the
continental tradition.

00:09:28.562 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it would
be a real challenge

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
to try and put together
a collection of winter

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
solstice, of Christmas and
New Year carols, music.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And one enterprising gentleman
translated the New Testament

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
into Broad Scots, which also
is rather lovely to listen to,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:84%
just to hear what the language
sounds like, because I

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:90%
don't sound like this at home.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I have to
have a via media

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.553 align:middle line:10%
so that people can
smile at my accent

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:10%
but still have a
chance of understanding

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:10%
what it is I'm saying.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is your
American version.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my American accent.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:90%
We do appreciate that.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:90%
And then you said--

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.392 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's "Still the Night."

00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:10%
The other one is, [SIGHS]
it's sort of an overview.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a look at the
material that I've

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
known since, you know,
Hecate was a pup,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all the way through to
the contemporary stuff

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:90%
that I'm singing now.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
There are singer-songwriters
that I admire a great deal.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And just a cross-section
of the material I'm

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
still with, hence the title,
the traditional material that's

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.213 align:middle line:84%
been with me for 50 odd
years at this point,

00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and the contemporary stuff
that still has something that I

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:90%
would like to say as well.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, OK.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And some of the message that
you're sharing now is what?

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:84%
If you had a philosophical
like one-liner,

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
what was-- does Jean want
to share with her music?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been asked
many times what I said.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever
asked me what I sang.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So I-- if you're ever in
trouble expressing yourself,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:90%
try singing.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the universal language.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It needs no
explanation at all.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a
foreign language, even

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
if the words don't
mean anything,

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:90%
the message will reach you.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, people have
said this in all sorts of ways

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:10%
and all sorts of languages.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:90%

And it'll do just that.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:10%
And with that, we
will take a break.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.016 align:middle line:84%

appreciated for sharing.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
our local mountain, Georgia.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:90%
It's 980 feet high.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is oilseed rape
in the foreground,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
which is a great cash
crop at this point.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:10%
That's the-- one of
the local pubs, where

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:10%
you get a wonderful pub lunch.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
That word is
pronounced ken-ocher.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to [THROAT RASP]
it, Kinneuchar.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:10%
And the whole area
is mixed arable.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a very tailored,
very tidy-looking county

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:10%
at this point.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:10%
There's very little
rough ground.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But right round the edge
are these wonderful fishing

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:90%
villages.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And as such, the county used to
be called the beggar's mantle

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
fringed with gold,
because all of the economy

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:90%
was based on the fishing.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing in the
middle of the county at all.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's a wonderful expression.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah, I like that.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we see Caledonia,
Caledonia was or is--

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>> An old name for Scotland.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so we're-- it's
just interchangeable?

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Hail Caledonia.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:10%
It's now a very poetic
usage of the word, yes.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And I told you that I
had been told that it was

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:10%
the unicorn that was the
national animal of Scotland.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And you said, no.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
To-- in some, for some of
the spiritual, metaphysical,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:90%
or unicorn lovers.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:10%
You can claim the unicorn
anywhere in the world, I think.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that he, she,
or it would be thrilled.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The royal standard is the
Lion Rampant, rather than

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:90%
the unicorn.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not quite sure
whether the unicorn is there

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:10%
as courtesy to both
countries or not

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:10%
on the royal crest from Britain.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:90%
But we can claim them.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's going to
tell us we're wrong?

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and when-- do you
write any of your own music,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:90%
any of your own words?

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:10%
Or are you always doing
the classical folk

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:10%
songs that have been handed
down for generations?

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No to all the above.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I have tried my
hand a couple of times.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I have any great
talent for writing songs.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:10%
More important, I've never
found any great need to.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.517 align:middle line:84%
One of the great strengths
of the tradition,

00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and why it's there
in the first place,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Scots are these
incredibly emotional people,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.695 align:middle line:84%
who would die rather
than admit it.

00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And it has to go somewhere.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And where it's gone
is into the music.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what it
is you want to express,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.988 align:middle line:84%
there is a song that will
do it within the tradition.

00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
there are many things

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.590 align:middle line:84%
that are now being discussed
in song that were not

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:90%
part of a tradition at all.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:10%
There are songs, for
instance, (SINGING) Nancy

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:10%
with the golden hair,
rattled young and dead,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:10%
absolved of all necessity
to earn her daily bread,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:10%
is about a young woman who has
died of an overdose of drugs.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, Edinburgh is
not free of that, either.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's lovely to have this
romantic notion of Scotland.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
But we have all of the
same problems there

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.513 align:middle line:90%
that exist elsewhere.

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
That would never have
come out of a tradition.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:10%
It was written by a
contemporary Scottish poet.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:10%
So anything that says what
I would like it to say,

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:10%
depending on the audience,
and the situation,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:10%
and as I'm fond of saying,
the state of my liver,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:10%
then that's what's
going to pop out.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The writing of songs,
no, I will leave that

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to people like Eric
Bogle and Judy Small,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:90%
who do such a wonderful job.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And I also read about too
that you don't like to really

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
set your performance and plan
ahead of time what you're going

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to be singing because you want
to respond to your audience?

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I suspect that without
ever having put a name to it,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:10%
ever trying to
define what it was,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:10%
my approach to programming
is almost purely intuitive.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:10%
And I've taken to
telling audiences now

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.533 align:middle line:10%
that I don't make up
a program because you

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:10%
can take the same
group of people,

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:10%
and put them in the same
hall at the same time

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:10%
two different nights, and
you have a different animal.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:10%
So I gauge-- smell the air, as
it were, and choose my program,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:10%
which means if they don't
like what I'm singing,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.775 align:middle line:10%
it's their fault.

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They have to
take responsibility.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But apart from anything else,
it keeps the repetition factor

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:90%
down very low.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:84%
My idea of absolute
hell, Georgia,

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.933 align:middle line:84%
is a 28-year run
on Broadway when

00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
you know exactly what
you're going to be doing

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
at 10 past 9:00 every night.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how people
stay sane doing that.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But you said you
use your intuition.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:10%
And one of my favorite Scottish
friends, Laura Anne Walker,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:10%
is an intuitive.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And she said--

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I know Laura, fine, yes.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:10%
>> She says that it is so
natural to the Scot to just be

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:10%
intuitive.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It is true to their nature.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's part of their being.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said they don't
even talk about it

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%
or think about it.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They just have a nice
connection with each other.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to use the
telephone all the time.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> That's certainly
true in my family.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
My mother was one of 12.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And she and her sisters, I'll
swear, worked by bush telegraph

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.745 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:18:16.745 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I also worried about-- this
is one of the reasons I

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:90%
left the country, I think.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I would worry about visiting
somebody in St Andrews.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:10%
By the time I drove
home all of 14 miles,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:10%
my mother would meet me with,
I believe you had coffee

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.472 align:middle line:10%
at Kate's.

00:18:29.472 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was without
the telephone.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
what was going on,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
but I thought a little bit
of distance was a good thing.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.305 align:middle line:10%
>> Because it might be a little
harder to connect on everything

00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:38.642 align:middle line:10%
you're doing with mom, right?

00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So how much time of the
year do you get to spend

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:10%
in Scotland?

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:10%
>> At this stage, I cut out
three months in the summer.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're just about to
leave for the summer.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm starting to get
just a little twitchy.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get
squirrely after I've been

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:90%
gone for seven or eight months.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And I need to go home
and touch the ground

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:90%
for a while, so three months.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.572 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a wealth of
CDs that you have created.

00:19:05.572 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't whether our
audience has seen them yet.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are about
30 or so, maybe about half

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of which you brought us.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And are you up to 40 now?

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Or where are you in your--

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> 42 recordings, I think.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that are 21 CDs.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to piece
together about 19 of them

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.797 align:middle line:90%
from what I had in the house.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I frequently don't have
all of my own stuff.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't quite know why.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I make them so that I
can learn the songs.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's silly
not to have them there.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you travel, what
is it that you want to know--

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:84%
them to know about this Scottish
philosophy, and the folks,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
songs, the stories,
and so forth?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:90%
What are we sharing with them?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.098 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.098 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that I've
ever stopped to wonder.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's marvelous music.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I think if I
present it properly,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
everybody will love it.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think maybe the
underlying message

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:90%
is, we may be very different.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
We may sound very different.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But all full, we're
all exactly the same.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
One responds very readily
to joy in somebody else.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And one responds equally
well, and probably even

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.020 align:middle line:84%
more readily, to
sadness, to loss,

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, is something
that is so hard to express.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:90%
And music does so well.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever has
to wonder why you

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
are singing about the loss
of love, life, or liberty,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:90%
or any combination thereof.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.605 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
we can all relate to.

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:31.605 align:middle line:90%
>> A universal language.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, from the
heart is how you sing.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.503 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you do, yes.

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, we only have
about a minute.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Is there a parting little--

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --song we might share?

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Come by the hills
to the land where life is

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:90%
a song.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And sing while the birds fill
the air with their joy all day

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:10%
long, where the
trees sway in time,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:10%
and even the winds sings in
tune, and the cares of tomorrow

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:10%
must wait till this day is done.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:10%


00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.500 align:middle line:10%
I think that takes us so
we can just maybe look

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:10%
across the hills and
the valleys of Scotland

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:10%
and just get a little
bit of a feeling for it.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, come back.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, have to.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Y'all come back, you hear?

languages, can you not?

00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:42.005 align:middle line:10%
Well, this has been delightful.

00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:42.805 align:middle line:10%
>> Indeed.

00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:10%

and I appreciate it.

If you would like to be in
touch with Jean Redpath,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:90%
please stay tuned.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.715 align:middle line:90%
We'll let you know how.

00:21:49.715 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:10%
And you know we always
love to hear from you,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:10%
and we always respond.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.059 align:middle line:90%
And then some parting thoughts.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it is in the
universal language of song

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that Jean Redpath has
shared with us today.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And really, because it
does come from the heart,

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and we do understand the
love, the life, the death,

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
the romance, and some of
the tragedies of life,

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
it is through song
that we can share that.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And I love it when
it is tradition,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and it is the folk songs, and
we just get to experience them.

Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
