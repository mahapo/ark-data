00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.540 align:middle line:90%
to Living in Balance.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.189 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited about today's
show, "Oh, the Energy."

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's about
energy, your energy,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's called Energy Medicine.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about the
chakras, the meridians,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.395 align:middle line:84%
even about guardians,
our spirit guardians.

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about a lot of fun things

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and have demonstrations on how
you can bring yourself back

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:84%
into balance or how you
can energize yourself.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.982 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:29.966 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The author is Donna Eden, and
the book is "Energy Medicine."

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:90%
And I absolutely loved it.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those that you
can use as a reference, that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
can remind you of what you
might need to do to come back

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
into balance, even
what you can do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:90%
to stop from getting that cold.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So I am so pleased today
to welcome Donna Eden.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We also saw that you have a
video, and I watched the video.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And your energy was terrific.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, you have
chosen the right topic.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about the subtle energies.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.602 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole list
of names for it.

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But what are we talking
about when you're

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
talking about our energy?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, energy is like the
infrastructure of your body.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And everything is energy also.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
body is not solid.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But we are made up of lattice
works of force fields,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and you can affect
those force fields.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And all around the world,
people use energy medicine--

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:90%
call it different things--

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
but they use energy medicine
as their healing techniques.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not as accessible
to Westerners.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
have a passion about

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is to make energy medicine
accessible and tangible

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to everyone because
we gain everything

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.397 align:middle line:90%
to know how to heal ourselves.

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's fascinating.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.647 align:middle line:84%
We do have a list of all
the different names and all

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the different cultures, and
I was very much surprised.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
They're called subtle energies,
but it's "chi" in Chinese.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:10%
We have "prana," and
we have the "yesod."

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:10%
The Native Americans
have a name for it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:10%
It's as if every culture has a
name for the subtle energies.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:10%
But I was very much
surprised, you ended with,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:10%
in the Western
culture, Holy Spirit

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:10%
was our life force,
our energy, and that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.824 align:middle line:10%
was amazing to me, yeah.

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, I see
energy as the life force.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is not something
I normally talk about

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
on television, but I
do see energy as of God

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:90%
and whatever you call that.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, there is no way
you can work in energy medicine

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
without tapping
into the spiritual.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And you know that this is
something very powerful

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and something miraculous
that can change our lives

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and get our health back.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and that's what
you've devoted your life to.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have been doing
this for many years.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're what I
would call an empath.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Now you're intuitive.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You have-- you feel
other people's energy,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and you can know
where they're having

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
issues or problems
in their body because

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:90%
of the shift in the energies.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the only natural
work I could have found myself

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:90%
on this particular path.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I got myself well.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
And, yes, I always felt energy.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
I always saw it.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when I found myself very
sick and getting myself well,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
it was just natural that I
wanted to then go out and show

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
other people how to
move their energy

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and instantly saw that we are
far more empowered than most

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:90%
people know.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was fascinated by
your story because so many

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
people do find their gift
to share after they've been

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
through a disease or, you
know, some sort of trauma.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.377 align:middle line:84%
And you decided to
take some coursework,

00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and you got immediately into an
advanced course accidentally--

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In Applied Kinesiology, so
that's part of what you do.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But it really is
all about energy.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all about energy.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
I have seen energy

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
look different, seem
different, flow differently,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.633 align:middle line:90%
depending on the system.

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then often, because I've
been teaching for the last 20

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
years all around the
world, sometimes I will go

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
into a culture, and
they'll say, oh,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.632 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about "da-da-da."

00:04:48.632 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:90%
They've got a different name.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk
about the chakras.

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple
visuals of the chakras.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And some people still
don't know what those are.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to explain to
us what we have in these, like,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:90%
energy wheels?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's a graphic you can
see that just shows the colors.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the picture shows the
seven main chakras in the body.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
say also that, even

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
though that gave color, I
see color as a little bit

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I see that our chakras
are like our blueprint,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and our energy is as
unique as a thumbprint.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So our colors are different,
and people will often

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
expect to have those colors
that will show up in a book.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And, no, it depends on your
story, your life, your health,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
your vitality, your secrets,
everything that's in you.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So a chakra is both
very spiritual,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.378 align:middle line:84%
but it's very practical
to work with the chakra.

00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have another graphic
of the chakras that actually

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
shows each one are tied into one
of the major glands and systems

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:90%
in the body, too.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore,
that energy center

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:84%
is affected by the
health or disease

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that you would have with that
particular part of the body

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:90%
or organ?

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's exactly right.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Chakras govern the
endocrine system.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you have ups
and downs in your moods,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you can know your chakras
are being affected.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
If you have issues in
your life, for instance,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe power issues
are your issue,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:90%
that's your third chakra.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If you are someone who is
still extremely playful

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and can let go and
have fun, you're

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
somebody who is very strong
in your second chakra.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So each chakra governs a
particular way of being,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and the different
organs in that area

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:90%
are affected by your chakra.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all the way
up through your body

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:90%
to the top of your head.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So then we can also look
then at that as a particular

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
culture's approach, but
we've been able to use that

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:90%
in Western philosophy.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But we also look at
the ancient Chinese

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
because you work a lot
with the meridians.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And meridians-- whereas
chakras spin in a wheel

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:90%
or a vortex, meridians stream.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
They are like energy pathways
or highways, and they pump--

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
they give energy to
the blood and the lymph

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to pump it through your body
and to get life and vitality

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
to all your cells.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And they help toxins
move out of your body.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I was reading
your book, I thought--

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that's why I said, it really
is a good reference book--

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
because I should be
knowledgeable about,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
for example, the heart meridian
or the kidney meridian if I had

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:90%
an issue with that.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I could actually work with
the flow of my own personal chi

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
if I knew what line that was.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So I could like massage up
one side of the body and do--

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'll just
use myself as an example.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a vulnerability
in spleen meridian,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
which I have made stronger
and stronger over the years.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've made it strong by not
only tracing that meridian,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
but tracing it backwards
to empty some of the energy

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing it
forward three times.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And it got stronger
and stronger.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that was
the beginning of my

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
turning my health around, just
focusing on that one meridian.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and when we think
about our immune system,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the lymphatic system, there
are things that we need to know

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that we could just keep
ourselves healthier all

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
the time if we just knew
more about our bodies.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But the patterns, the
energy flow in the body.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's several things.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that
many of the things

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
show you right now,

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.540 align:middle line:84%
many are very
instinctual to people.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And people do them
all the time and say, oh,

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
One of them, I always think,
is when people get stressed,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
they tend to throw their
hand up to their forehead.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I call these the
"Oh, my god" points.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Because you go, "Oh, my god."

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's happening
when you get stressed,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
you lose blood from
your forebrain.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It goes into your body for
the fight or flight response.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So right at the time
when you want your mind

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to work the best, the
clearest, it's checked out.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
The blood is leaving
your forebrain.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why you
often can't think.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you put your
hand to your forebrain

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and hold it long
enough, you will

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
begin to feel the blood coming
back up into your forebrain.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- some people will
put the pads of both fingers.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll see people
with one hand on front, one hand

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%
on back.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.265 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and now where
you instinctually

00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
did it on the side is
you're affecting triple

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:90%
warmer and gallbladder, OK?

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Triple warmer is really
mega fight or flight.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Now this is the extreme, right?

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's the extreme.

00:09:44.955 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But you affect your energies
by placing your hands

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:90%
on your head like that.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, another
fascinating thing you said

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was where, if you have, for
example, a point that's really

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
tender, you need to
massage that because that's

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
another line or a point
where energy is blocked.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So without anybody
energy testing you,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
you can know-- begin
to know your own body

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
by just feeling
around on your body

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and seeing where you're hurt.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a point somewhere
that you can massage.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And you will start
cleaning it up,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.713 align:middle line:84%
and you will begin to feel
that you've got more vitality.

00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I kind of laughed
as I was reading it, too.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.535 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know, I should
never be sitting still.

00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I'm watching television
or if I'm reading or whatever,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I should be rubbing
some part of my body.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I should be massaging
something that would be helpful

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to me, depending on what my
situation is, even if it's just

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to come back to balance
or come back to energy.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know you can make
it like automatic pilot.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
If you learn it and get
it into your habit field,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
it can be like
brushing your teeth.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I have people take
like the chart

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
in my book of the
lymphatics and put it up

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:90%
on your bathroom mirror.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And just note where on
your body you're hurting

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and just make it
like second nature

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.405 align:middle line:84%
to begin to feel these points
and seeing where you're hurt.

00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you said we're
going to energy test.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.843 align:middle line:84%
We can show that in
our next segment,

00:11:10.843 --> 00:11:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and also we're going to see
some kind of fun things.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll stay tuned,
we'll be right back

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with Donna Eden and
Energy Medicine.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.482 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
If you are just joining us,
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today in this
program is Donna Eden,

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and the subject is
Energy Medicine.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
give you techniques

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that you can do that will
bring you back into balance,

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.323 align:middle line:84%
will energize you, if need
be, or help you to heal.

00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to talk about again,

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
we're just going to mention the
meridians acupressure points,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Now those are the same.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The acupressure points
are along the meridian.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So we can--

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
if we learn those
points, we'll know

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
those points that will
help us to allow the energy

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:90%
to flow again.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you don't
have to memorize them.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You can make this
as easy as possible.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But you can learn
the meridian lines,

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you actually don't even have
to go to absolute acupuncture

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
If you just start tracing
along the meridian lines

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.933 align:middle line:84%
or massaging or tapping, you're
going to affect that energy.

00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, another thing
that she had said, too,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.553 align:middle line:84%
and a little point
is in our ears.

00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
techniques you said

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is start your day with
a massage of the ears.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we looked at the
example of the ear diagram,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.467 align:middle line:84%
you would be then
massaging your whole body.

00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> By massaging your ears.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You actually don't have to know
what all of those points mean.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you pull your ears out
in the morning or some time

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of the day when you feel like
you're kind of losing it,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, pull your ears out
and fold your ears forward,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
it empties a lot of the
energy that you've collected.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And so it's an excellent thing.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.852 align:middle line:84%
It's a good wake-up way
in the morning, too.

00:13:08.852 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You have so many
wonderful techniques.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
We do have a tape that
you show, though, how

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:90%
you can tell if you need it.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to tell us a little
bit about energy testing?

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a major part of your
energy medicine, isn't it?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I like to teach energy testing.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's both an
art and a science

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
get the feel of it.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you do, it's a
reliable biofeedback system.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can test all of the
muscles in the whole body,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
but you really need to only
test-- use one test to test

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:90%
how the energy is flowing.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.046 align:middle line:90%
So, let's see--

00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps we should just--
let's do the demonstration.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
They can see how you test.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Then we can talk
about all the ways

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
you can apply it with
everything from herbs to food

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to anything in your environment.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's have a demonstration.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
This was kind of fun.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to show you
just how electromagnetic

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
your energies are and
all of our energies are.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to energy test you by
placing your arm up like this.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to push
up as I push down.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:90%
All right, nice and strong.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to show you
just how I, or anyone, can

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:90%
affect energy.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And my hands are electromagnetic
as well as your body.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to trace up
your energy fields like this.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.997 align:middle line:84%
And now put your arm
up again and push up

00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:90%
with all your might.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.544 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I'm just
going to use one finger.

00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
That's because it was
like I had a magnet.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
It took energy out
of that pathway.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Now if I trace it forward,
it should bring it back.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes
when-- maybe you've

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
been pushing a lot in
your life and taking

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
on a whole lot of
things, your energy

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
has a tendency to run backwards.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to show you
something real interesting.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you just to
walk backwards, about

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:90%
three more steps.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Now place your arm up again,
and I'm going use one finger.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You lose-- and you're doing
this with all your might, right?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.696 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:24.496 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.496 --> 00:15:26.635 align:middle line:84%
You're losing energy
as-- oh, gosh.

00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
You walked backwards.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Walk forward and let
me see what happens.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
You're doing some-- you're
caught in between, OK?

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
You're walking backwards,
you're losing energy.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You're walking forward,
you're losing energy.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Means that it's time to
take a little vacation.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to give
you a technique that

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
can turn that around.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Right here, underneath
your clavicle corners,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
drop into a little
hole and massage that.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I like to cross my
hands because it

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:84%
helps the energy to cross over
and take a really deep breath.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And at these points, they're
called Kidney 27 points, K-27,

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're juncture points for
all the meridians in the body.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And they'll flip
the energy around

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and make them go forward again.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see if you
can both walk backwards and walk

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:90%
forward, OK?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So you walk backwards and see
if you've still got your energy.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I pushed much
harder, didn't I?

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to tell the television
audience that it really worked.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.207 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
just look and see

00:16:33.207 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
if something else
that you might need.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to place
your hand right there

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and hold your arm
real strong, OK?

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:90%
You're nice and weak.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want you to do
is on both sides, just tap.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Breathe and tap.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, enough.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Put your hand right
back there and hold it

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:90%
with all your might.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm pushing
with all my might.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is that tends
to bring your vitality back

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and stabilize it.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.395 align:middle line:84%
So what we did then, you said
that you needed to balance me,

00:17:12.395 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we--
but that's individual.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
That could have happened
to-- someone else

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
may have needed something
completely different.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Needed something
completely different.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But now I'm going to
try not to hit my mic,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to do again
for the people who didn't get

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:90%
to see it up close.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.648 align:middle line:84%
The K-27 is that
Kidney 27 point right

00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
underneath the bone, where
it's like a little indented.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is where you
would do the massage.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:10%
>> And there are three points
for massage, the K-27 meridian,

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:10%
the thymus, and
the spleen points.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In the stress reduction class
that you talk a lot about is

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.177 align:middle line:90%
also thumping the thymus.

00:17:43.177 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> The thymus gland.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I call
these three thumps

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
because if you thump here
and then thump there and then

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
thump what I just
showed you on your side,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
all three together-- this
one gets the chemistry going.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:84%
This one makes your
immune system turn on,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and this one flips
the energies around

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.338 align:middle line:90%
so they're going forward.

00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So that would be something
that we might incorporate

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
into our life, and
it's very easy.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So easy to do as you're
running out the door.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so those three
areas, again, the K-27,

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.083 align:middle line:84%
thumping the thymus, and
then just basically the--

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And tapping
your spleen points.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>> They're called.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They're right in
between the ribs,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
right on the side of your body.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, great.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, I like that.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now there was something
else that we get to do,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.012 align:middle line:84%
that we get to talk about on
this show that, like you said,

00:18:24.012 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
you don't usually talk about
God all the time and so forth.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But we talk about balance
in mind, body, spirit.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And you did mention
that, in your work,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:84%
in working with people
and being intuitive,

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
there are the other
realms, OK, where

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
we do have spirit guardians.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about the
energies that you work with

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and what you noticed
dealing with people.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've had a private
practice for 23 years.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I never go into any
session, any treatment,

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
knowing what's going to happen.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I never plan on a spirit
guardian coming forth.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I go in just
to work on the energy.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But if an energy appears
or comes into the room

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:84%
or I feel like I am being
told something of what to do,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's usually when
it happens, sometimes

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:84%
when I feel like I'm stumped,
I can't figure this out.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Often, if I'm really in tune
with this person's energy

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and the energy
surrounding us, then I

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
will feel sometimes like I'm
hearing exactly what to do.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I will see it.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I will
be told something

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:90%
that makes no sense at all.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But I have learned to
pay attention and do it,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:90%
and it always works.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There is another
aspect, too, with that,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.735 align:middle line:84%
and you call it
protecting the healer.

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I told you.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.902 align:middle line:84%
I'm empathetic, and so
sometimes it's hard for me

00:19:51.902 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to be in an energy when somebody
is like ill or something.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do to
protect the healer?

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is extremely
important because I am very

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:90%
empathetic.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody who merges
with everybody's energies.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So I have had to learn how
to not at all separate myself

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
from people because I've
actually learned how

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and allow that
energy to move through me,

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
but continue it on so
it doesn't stay stuck.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, and
that's the best way for me,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
then fresh new energy
comes through me, too.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like a circuitry occurs,
and I get healed in the session

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:90%
as much as they do.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:34.035 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's-- yes.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You also mentioned just
briefly past lifetimes are

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
a factor that sometimes
affect this lifetime.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Often when I'm, for
instance, working

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
on perhaps cloacals or
grid work or chakras,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
then at that very, very
deep level, sometimes

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
a story or images will
come up that have nothing

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
to do with their life.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And a long time ago, I
learned that if I said nothing

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
about it, then something
would stop in the energy flow.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like the intelligence
or the wisdom in their body

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
was allowing it to come forth,
so I needed to deal with it.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.505 align:middle line:90%
And so I do.

00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I speak of it.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a person doesn't
believe in a past life.

>> But it doesn't matter.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I will say something
like, well, you know,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:90%
you can use this as a metaphor.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.413 align:middle line:90%
Let's just not turn it off.

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Donna, you're
an absolute gift.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And I love the book.

And if you would like to

I have really enjoyed
both meeting Donna

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and also reading the book.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely fabulous.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It just brought more information
to me about my energy

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and how I might keep
myself healthier

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and how I might live in balance.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And this hopefully could
serve you well, too.

Until next time, I'm

May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
