>> Hello.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.568 align:middle line:10%
I'm Georgia
Shakti-Hill, and I want

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:05.530 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to
"Living in Balance,"

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.170 align:middle line:10%
and we are living in
balance in San Francisco.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We are so pleased
to have guests who

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
are going to share
with us forgiveness,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
because forgiveness is
the key to happiness,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness works.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.998 align:middle line:90%
So come join us.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I am so pleased to have doctors
Diane Cirincione and Gerry

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Jampolsky, PhD, and
MD, and partners

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.325 align:middle line:90%
in life and in forgiveness.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:43.125 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to be here.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So wonderful to
be here, Shakti.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you certainly
have shared the concept

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness for years
and years with people,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and it just keeps growing,
and we still need to forgive,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe so.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my own personal
experience with "Love is

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Letting Go of Fear," which
was in a book that you had

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
authored, Gerry,
was so profound.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It really changed my life, and
that was many, many years ago,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and I sat down with the book
and I couldn't put it down

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
until I had read
the whole thing.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, it introduced me
to a course in miracles,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and I became a student
and a teacher of that.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is close to
my heart, and I'm

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
so pleased that, forgiveness
being the subject,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
you still have, again, a
wonderful work here of,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
"Forgiveness, the
Greatest Healer of All."

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me about the
Forgiveness Project.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It is worldwide, and it is
very powerful and profound,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and you're both involved.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We're both very involved,
and first involved because I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
don't think you can possibly
have a successful marriage

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
unless it's completely
based on forgiveness.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you agree?

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Gerry and I
received some very,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:10%
very strong guidance
individually,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:10%
as well as collectively,
that forgiveness,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:10%
which has been a cornerstone
of attitudinal healing work,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:10%
that that be as important to
us as eating and breathing,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:10%
and that we bring it out in the
world in such a way that we can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:10%
cross-culturally create a
tapestry of the variations

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:10%
on the theme so people will
come to understand each

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.143 align:middle line:10%
other's experiences
of forgiveness.

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing that through
the collection of forgiveness

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:84%
stories from around the
world onto our website,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
ForgivenessWorks.org, as well
as the creation of Forgiveness

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Gardens.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, Gerry,
the Centers for Attitudinal

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Healing, that was your baby.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
started many years ago.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> 1975, actually.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And those centers are
all over the world?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:10%
>> There are about 150 centers
or groups around the world,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:10%
all offering free services.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.245 align:middle line:84%
And in all these different
countries, and I understand--

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> 30 different countries.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.318 align:middle line:84%
>> --even the book that I was
making reference to, "Love is

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Letting Go of Fear," you said
that it is even translated

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
into Farsi?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> That is, the new book,
the forgiveness book,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
is translated in some countries
it hadn't been in before,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
like it's translated
in Indonesia.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Saudi Arabia, Turkey.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
These are places where our other
books hadn't been received yet.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> And we do have--

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
this forgiveness book
is the sixth book

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.695 align:middle line:84%
of ours now being
published unedited in Iran.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Wonderful.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.602 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are the president of
the Jampolsky Outreach Program?

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Outreach Foundation.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Outreach Foundation.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this, you're
seeing on a worldwide basis

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that we can work together.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
We need to work together
for forgiveness,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness is something
that we can accomplish.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely something
we can accomplish,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's really
helpful too to look further

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
into understanding what it
is, and maybe what it's not.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness,
you know, doesn't

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
mean agreeing with someone
else's outrageous behavior,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
or supporting inappropriate
acts We look at forgiveness

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
how you come to the place

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
where you can really
master your own inner life,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
where you can look
at your judgments

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.742 align:middle line:84%
and see where your own pain
is to free yourself from that

00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and have an integrity and a
harmony in what you're thinking

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and saying and doing, and then
go forward to make decisions

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in the world, not out
of taking your anger

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to an angry situation
and making more anger,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.078 align:middle line:84%
or bringing your rage
to a raging situation.

00:04:14.078 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we need to look at
forgiveness in a different way.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't forgive
because if they-- well,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a sign of weakness.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it's saying, what
that person did was OK,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
or condoning or
agreeing with it.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't forgive because we
say, oh, that personal will just

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:90%
do it again.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize that,
when we don't forgive,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
we're holding on to the
toxins of anger which really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
can affect every
part of our body

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and every organ in our body.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
decision not to forgive

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.252 align:middle line:90%
is really a decision to suffer.

00:04:41.252 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we do
forgive, it's really

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
a decision to find a sense
of peace and happiness.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness
doesn't have anything

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:90%
to do with the other person.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not like two people
come together and say, oh,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:90%
isn't it wonderful?

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:90%
We can be together again.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The other person may not change,
but we can't change the pain

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're carrying on, and
that's what forgiveness is.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a releasing of the
painful past in ourselves.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, initially in your
work as a medical doctor,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:90%
psychiatry was your field.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And what-- as I
recall in your work,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
you worked with people who
were experiencing illness,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
often terminal illness, and
especially with children.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And they needed to
really, in order

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to heal, whether it was
physically or spiritually,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.705 align:middle line:90%
they needed to forgive.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I don't think we
realize how much our unforgiving

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
thoughts interfere
with chemotherapy--

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
with the chemotherapy
of any kind.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.902 align:middle line:84%
So as we learn to open the door
for people to make choices,

00:05:31.902 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
we don't tell people
they should forgive.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
We say, there are choices.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they make
that choice to forgive,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.008 align:middle line:84%
even the dying patient
can die in peace

00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
when they begin to let go of
some of the things they've

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
been holding on to.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And we look at health
as inner peace and healing

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
as the letting go of fear, so
our work isn't about healing

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.773 align:middle line:84%
It's about healing your
mind, healing your heart.

00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know,
it's interesting.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Just when you think
that you've mastered it,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
you have an opportunity
to forgive again.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's not
a one shop thing.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it sure isn't.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's a continuous
process throughout our life.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Center of Attitudinal
Healing in Sausalito,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
California, which is
really the mother center,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:84%
now has been doing
workshops in forgiveness.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing many
things for the community

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to help people
find-- you can really

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
find a sense of
inner peace even when

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
chaos and fear and uncertainty
is going on all around you.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can
choose inner peace,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and it really is something
that you do consciously.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- you're
trying to educate people

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to that, that what
they can do is

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
they can control their
response to a situation, not

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the situation, and that is the
healthiest thing they can do

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:90%
to maintain that inner peace.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't have to be
robots that just respond with

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:90%
anger.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with anger,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
but it's the holding
onto the anger that

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
gets us in trouble,
the attachment to anger

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:90%
that so many of us have.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I could
just interject.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really an important
point to make is that

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
there's no room for
denial in this work.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.777 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about
looking head on

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and what the problem
is and what the trauma.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not about, like, oh
it doesn't really exist,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
or using some affirmation
to cover it up.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.392 align:middle line:84%
It's about looking at it
and knowing that, you know,

00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
do you want to honor your own
human experience, your anger,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and all your emotions, and
knowing that ultimately, it's

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.368 align:middle line:84%
you that determines how long
you're going to stay angry,

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
how long you're going to
stay in pain, et cetera.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Just one quick example.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A musician came up to me one
day today, to Diane and I both,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.395 align:middle line:84%
and he had had a fight
with his brother.

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
They had not talked to
each other for seven years.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
He read one of my
books and he said,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call my brother, at
least do my part in letting go.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And the brother
answered the phone

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.347 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, I'll have
breakfast with you.

00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:90%
They didn't talk about the past.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.753 align:middle line:84%
They spent about three
hours with each other,

00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and the brother was killed
in an automobile accident

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:90%
two days later.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And just wanted to
thank Diane and I for that

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
opportunity of really
doing it now, not waiting,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
not procrastinating, not
becoming king or queen

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.865 align:middle line:90%
of the procrastinators' club.

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, as
I read the book--

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and it is a wonderful
book, this "Forgiveness,"

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.815 align:middle line:84%
what it reminded me to do
was be aware of that anger,

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and because there
will be those upsets.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.782 align:middle line:84%
And again, it came back to, but
how long will I hold the anger?

00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you have
to forgive yourself too.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.393 align:middle line:90%
>> That the big one.

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:01.392 align:middle line:90%
>> That is.

00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people say,
you can't do that.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes you can.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
It is with intention that
you can forgive yourself.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's necessary.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we need all
the reminders we can.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
We have this-- maybe you
can hold this up Diane.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love this.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.915 align:middle line:84%
>> I call it healing the
soul, and I really created it

00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
for myself because
I needed to help.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people like using it,
and it fits into your shoe,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and it says, may every step
you take be one of forgiveness.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.523 align:middle line:84%
And it has our website,
ForgivenessWorks.org,

00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and it really helps me to
look at that every morning

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.685 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, it's a new
day for forgiveness.

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Waiters and
waitresses love it.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's a great idea.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
It really is, because it
just fits right in there,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.459 align:middle line:90%
and we all put our shoes on.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> May every step you take
be one of forgiveness.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:90%
ForgivenessWorks.org.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:90%
So that tells us.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we're
behaving as best we can,

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
because we are humans in
this situation, but we do--

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.785 align:middle line:84%
we can learn, and we can
learn processes and steps.

00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be talking more about
those, because you've created--

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
you really are trying
to help us with this.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But tell me a little bit more
about this worldwide project,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing with
the gardens, you said?

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The Forgiveness Gardens is
a part of the Forgiveness Works

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.492 align:middle line:84%
Project, and that is people
coming together in community,

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to each other
in any way that they want.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.255 align:middle line:90%
It could be schoolchildren.

00:09:09.255 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be people
of different faiths.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It could be people
in a neighborhood.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And a Forgiveness Garden can be
anything from-- this one group

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of children had
one potted plant,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and they treated it
like a special treasure.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Others made raised flower beds.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Others make entire city
parks, whether it's

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in Belfast, or in
Lebanon, in Beirut, here

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:90%
in northern California.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
People are creating
forgiveness gardens as a way

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.935 align:middle line:90%
to come together in community.

00:09:35.935 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And a way of raising the
consciousness of forgiveness,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
because we need all the
reminders we can get.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're working especially
with children in this project

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Children as well as adults.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Forgiveness
Works Project,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
it also collects incredible
data and information

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
on the theological and
philosophical and cultural

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
aspects of forgiveness
from all over the world.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
The Forgiveness Gardens this
is a really fun and exciting,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:90%
you know, project.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:10%
In Oakland, California, there
is The Attitudinal Healing

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Connection, one of the
centers, and the centers

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:10%
are all independent.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:10%
In this particular center,
there's a young girl.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:10%
She was nine years of age, and
she started Children Teachers

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:10%
of Peace with us back
in 1981 with Jehan

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.107 align:middle line:10%
Sadat, our 10-year
project about children

00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:10%
reaching out in the world.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And now she's 28.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
She's gone through the Oakland
College of Arts and Crafts.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.557 align:middle line:84%
She's the director of the
artist program in Oakland.

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:24.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, she's reaching
out to the schools in Oakland,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and schoolchildren are
creating Forgiveness Gardens,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and each step of the way, they
are learning about forgiveness,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
about uncovering, about
nurturing, about planting,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.617 align:middle line:84%
about sowing seeds and
being responsible for those.

00:10:39.617 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:90%
It's quite exciting.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.617 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, it's more than
just Forgiveness Gardens.

00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:10%
We're really
encouraging communities

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:10%
to take on a project of
forgiveness in their community,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:10%
to bring forgiveness
into their schools,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:10%
to have town meetings where
people bring their forgiveness

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:10%
stories and talk about the
ways that forgiveness works,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.407 align:middle line:10%
rather than what the
newspapers talk about

00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:10%
and where it doesn't work.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So communities having a
forgiveness evening or a whole

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness day.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And all that information,
those curriculums,

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.295 align:middle line:84%
there's entire schools now
doing forgiveness projects

00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and loading on the
website so others can see.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> At one school, we did a
workshop for forgiveness.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.076 align:middle line:84%
They want to be known as the
Forgiveness School of Hawaii.

00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
with our audience

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.767 align:middle line:84%
we're going to share in our
next segment 10 stepping stones

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to forgiveness,
because it's something

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.780 align:middle line:90%
we all need to practice.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay tuned,
we will be right back

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.467 align:middle line:84%
with more of forgiveness,
because forgiveness works.

00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:10%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:10%
and our subject is forgiveness,
because forgiveness works.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And our guests are Doctors Diane
Cirincione and Gerry Jampolsky,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and they are partners in life
and in this project, which

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I visited your website,
and I asked you

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
if we might share
with our audience

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
some of the stepping stones to
forgiveness, because I think

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that serves people well,
and some of the subjects

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that you had brought up
about how it isn't really

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:90%
from weakness that we forgive.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It's really from
power, and it is

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
such a blessing to
the person we forgive,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:90%
but mostly to ourselves.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The first point in
your stepping stones

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is, we must be open to the
possibility of changing

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:90%
your beliefs about forgiveness.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And how should we think
differently about forgiveness?

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, so many of us spend
our lives thinking that certain

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:10%
things are unforgivable, and
we hold on to that belief that

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:10%
there are certain things
that we will never forgive.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.587 align:middle line:84%
So it means really being
open to that being a mistake.

00:12:38.587 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness, again, doesn't
mean agreeing with that act,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
it means only healing
yourself of the pain

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and anger you're holding on to.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I have to raise my hand.

00:12:46.442 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm guilty on that
one, because I

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
have had what I'd consider some
bottom lines that were, like,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:84%
unforgivable things, and we
just can't hold on to those.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't serve as well.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the reason we
want to still believe that

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
they're unforgivable is because
we think that forgiving them

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
means condoning them, and
forgiveness has nothing to do

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
with condoning or taking away
someone else's responsibility.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Your second point is
about being a victim,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and we have to be willing
to let go of being a victim,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and some people have gotten
so comfortable with that it

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of
that, oh, pity me.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is sort of a
nice place to hide out.

00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
guilt, you know?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
If I'm feeling guilt, it's
like, OK, I'm now guilty.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm guilty.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.347 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- it's like a
little corner you can hide in,

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:10%
and you have to really make
choices to move yourself out

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:10%
of that role.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.982 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean somebody
has to, but if you

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:33.492 align:middle line:10%
decide that after a while you
want to stop being miserable,

00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:10%
then you have a choice.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:90%
You know you have a choice.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:35.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:36.515 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So many of us take
that past experience,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
superimpose it on the present,
we keep scratching the old

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
wounds, and we continue
that victim role,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and we don't wake up to the fact
that we can choose not to be

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:90%
a victim.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We can process what happened
without carrying it on.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember one of
those phrases from one

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:90%
of my teachers.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
There are no victims,
only volunteers.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And that really is empowering.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great phrase.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that?

00:13:57.185 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I hadn't heard that before.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But you know, one of the
first lines in your book--

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.307 align:middle line:90%
and I love that book--

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
"Forgiveness," we
are responsible

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:90%
for our own happiness.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we say that, that's
what we're really looking at,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It certainly helps you be in
a relationship more easily with

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
someone, whether it's
someone that you work with,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
someone you've grown up
with, someone that, like,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
that you're married to.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize
that, ultimately, you

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
are responsible--
it doesn't mean

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that there aren't catalytic
effects on the world that

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
influence you.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Of course they do.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it's
how you deal with it.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Attitudinal healing is the
realization that it's not

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
people or events
or experiences that

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
happen to you that
make you upset,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.980 align:middle line:84%
it's your experience
of those things.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Up to 50% of people have not
totally forgiven their parents.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
75% of people who
have divorced have not

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:90%
forgiven their ex spouses.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to heal
those things before we can

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:90%
have a real relationship today.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's that
basic psychology 101.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And it really is so true.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.613 align:middle line:84%
We have to heal the
relationships with our parents,

00:14:53.613 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%
and we have to forgive them.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
They were doing their best.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop blaming other
people for our unhappiness

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and take responsibility
for that.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, all of those
haves and musts and should get

00:15:02.475 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
translated into,
you can choose to.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's really OK with
me if somebody else wants to be

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
miserable.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like your choice.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes, we just
need to stay in that place.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.707 align:middle line:84%
I certainly do, and I don't want
somebody to pull me out of it.

00:15:14.707 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So I need to be
comfortable with that,

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and others can be
comfortable with it too.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I like knowing that
I have choices,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that if I am really
having a really bad day

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that I can do
something about that.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because it feels
so much better physically,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and when you're angry
it's very uncomfortable.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Remind yourself that
your anger and judgments

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
can't change the past,
or punish someone else,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:90%
but they can hurt you.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what we suffer from.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:90%
We suffer from our anger.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%
We suffer from our pain.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We suffer from our fear
of the past of what

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
has-- our pain in the past, and
our fear of the future of what

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:90%
is or isn't going to.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the reality
that the past is gone.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It really remains
in our heads only.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The future is never
going to happen.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.845 align:middle line:84%
It's only a thought system that
actually becomes the present.

00:15:58.845 --> 00:15:59.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Be in the now.

00:15:59.645 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to respect the
future so that when it does

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
become the present, it
doesn't turn into chaos.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's about really
honoring the present.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Or making it more graphic,
it's like taking arsenic

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and expecting
someone else to die.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.420 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:90%
That is.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, because you're
so angry at them.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And they may be going on.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They might not even be here
anymore and not even know

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:90%
you're upset with them.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
value of giving up

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
not some but all
of your judgments.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
That is a stepping stone.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> A major one.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
We know a woman who at 90--

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:90%
we met her at 94.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.950 align:middle line:84%
At 87, she completely
changed her life.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:90%
An extraordinary woman.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we asked her,
what is it about your--

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.587 align:middle line:84%
what is it about you
that has shifted so much?

00:16:41.587 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And she just looked at us.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Remember, Gerry?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And she was from
Finland, and she said,

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I just gave up all my judgments.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we give
up our ability to evaluate

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%
or our thinking powers.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, you
can evaluate objectively,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.095 align:middle line:84%
and many of us are
paid to evaluate.

00:16:58.095 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
We train a lot of social
workers, et cetera, people

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:90%
who, that's your responsibility.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.883 align:middle line:84%
That's different than
making judgments on people.

00:17:04.883 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're talking about
judgements like character

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:90%
assassination.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really possible to see
the light in people rather than

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
the lampshade, and we
need to stop looking

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.911 align:middle line:84%
at people's behavior and
recognize that people are

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:84%
either loving or that they're
fearful and giving out a call

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:90%
of help for love.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And this really forms the
basis of attitudinal healing

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is all about, changing
our perceptions.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.098 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you can
step back from that,

00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that that is
where they're coming from,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
they're coming from fear, then
it is easier to forgive them--

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.505 align:middle line:90%
>> --once you can be detached?

00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Our heart will accept
them when we do that.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
One can recognize that
holding onto anger

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:84%
will not bring you
what you truly want.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
There isn't really a payoff
for that anger, is there?

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a good
question to ask ourselves.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Does holding on to what I
think is justified anger really

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:90%
bring me peace of mind?

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.693 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone's going
to say, no, not really,

00:17:52.693 --> 00:17:55.235 align:middle line:84%
and begin to say, well, I don't
want to hold on to that then.

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:59.175 align:middle line:84%
>> And oftentimes it takes time,
although we don't realize that

00:17:59.175 --> 00:18:01.245 align:middle line:84%
we're the ones that
determine the time.

00:18:01.245 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
it's going to take,

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, a year
to get over this,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.745 align:middle line:90%
then it's going to take a year.

00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It'll take a year.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.537 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think it's
going to take six months,

00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:10.858 align:middle line:84%
if you think it'll never
happen, it will never happen.

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that
it's possible to happen

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.692 align:middle line:84%
in an instant, then it
will happen in an instant.

00:18:14.692 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:90%
There's no schedule for anybody.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:10%
It's just that, for each
of us to become aware

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:10%
that we have a tremendous
amount of input and power

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.358 align:middle line:10%
over the course
of our own lives--

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:10%
not necessarily what
happens on the outside

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.525 align:middle line:10%
all the time, because a lot
of that we don't have control

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:10%
over, but what we
do have control over

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:10%
are the thoughts and
attitudes and judgments

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.463 align:middle line:10%
and perceptions and projections
that are inside of us.

00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know,
it's interesting.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
There are terrible
things that happen,

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and there are people
that do awful things,

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and we have to just recall
that, that it isn't condoning.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Again, it is just forgiving.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And stepping back from it.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't mean that you
don't go out and do something

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.557 align:middle line:84%
about it, but it means you don't
come from the place of your own

00:18:54.557 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
anger and multiplying the
anger, as I mentioned before.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.095 align:middle line:84%
It means that, once you have
found your own responsibility,

00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
you say, what do I need
to think, say, and do

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:90%
about this situation?

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.735 align:middle line:84%
And then, go out on
the world and do it.

00:19:04.735 --> 00:19:07.152 align:middle line:84%
>> A couple of years ago, we
were involved in a conference

00:19:07.152 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
in Bosnia with religious
and spiritual leaders,

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness
and reconciliation.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was this one priest
that shared going to his house

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and saw it burning.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
His-- he was from
Serbia, actually,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Bosnians had taken
his parents, grandparents,

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and four siblings in a house,
sealed it up, and torched it,

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and he said at the moment
that he saw that, he

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:90%
realized he had two choices.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
He was either going to spend the
rest of his life hunting them

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
down and be one of
them, or he'd have

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:90%
to learn somehow to forgive.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And we found him, of
course, as a Serbian priest.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful story.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:19:42.122 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, see that there is no
value in punishing yourself,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that it's a gift to
ourselves if we do forgive.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Gerry, talk about that pill
that you often talk about.

00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:90%
If somebody had a pill that--?

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I think I remember.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:90%
The pill.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.585 align:middle line:84%
If you read on your TV
program that a pill had

00:20:01.585 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
been just invented
that's guaranteed

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
to take away all the
anger that we ever

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:11.922 align:middle line:84%
had, all of our
judgments, and it's free.

00:20:11.922 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> There are no side effects.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:90%
No side effects.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We'd run and get it, and this
is really what forgiveness does.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.662 align:middle line:84%
>> The decision to, and
willingness to, forgive.

00:20:19.662 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you'll write that
prescription, I understand,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Prescription for peace.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:23.785 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose to be
happy rather than right.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Ah-ha.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's right in the
sense that-- of righteousness.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That in other
words, if I'm right,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that means I have to make
sure that you're wrong.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Making the other person wrong.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And believe that
you have the power

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
to choose the thoughts
you put into your mind.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So we really can control
those thoughts in our mind.

That's that practical
spirituality, even.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:90%

That's what it's all about,
that no one else decides

00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:10%
what thoughts we put in
the body but ourselves,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:10%
and so meditation and being
prayerful, spending time

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:10%
in nature, learning to
still the mind is some

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:10%
of the ingredients that's
really important to begin

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:10%
to discipline our minds so we
begin to have loving thoughts

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:10%
rather than fearful
and attacking thoughts.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, the
last one I just love.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Be willing to make peace
of mind your only goal,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%

is the key to happiness.

can become our intentions.

that having peace of mind
