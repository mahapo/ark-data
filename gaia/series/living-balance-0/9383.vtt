00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I am so pleased to welcome you
today to "Living in Balance."

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about harmony and humor

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
with Chinese medicine,
with the art of qigong.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Learn how you can
live in balance

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%
in mind, body, and spirit.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haley is dedicated
to healing and health.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And he is using harmony
and humor and qigong

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese medicine
to get us there.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, the most
important thing is balance.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd like to welcome
him so he can tell us

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
about living in balance with a
little bit of humor and harmony

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
with qigong.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's hope.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But you have dedicated your
life to Chinese medicine.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You said, especially
acupuncture,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
that you just have found
that it's a wonderful way

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
to deal with your
patients, with your people.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And the whole concept
of acupuncture

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese medicine
is based on the idea

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of being in harmony
with oneself and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:90%
with the natural surroundings.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is just a
matter of harmony.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is ancient,
it is traditional.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.148 align:middle line:84%
And we're accepting
that in our culture,

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and we're learning quite a bit.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Are we not?

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> More and more.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I think Western medicine
is expanding its horizons,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and dropping a lot
of the tunnel vision

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.802 align:middle line:84%
that's restricted it for so many
years, and bringing a smile.

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to say,
[LAUGHS] what is the fun part?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Doing it with a smile rather
than fighting and kicking

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:90%
through the whole process.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:10%
So we can have some humor
as we heal ourselves.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, absolutely. yeah.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I see so many therapists or
health care practitioners

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:10%
that leave out one
aspect-- one major aspect

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:10%
of the whole human experience.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's being able to laugh.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Humor.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Dr. Norman Cousins
basically healed himself

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
watching old Marx Brothers
movies, so he says.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And Dr. Bernie Siegel
dedicated his life to it.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.587 align:middle line:90%
>> --tests that have proven.

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Chinese say that even
when you're doing acupuncture

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
ore when you're doing qigong,
there should be a smile.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's a group of
acupuncturists from Japan--

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:10%
all of these
acupuncturists are blind.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And they practice a
method called Toyo Hari.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:10%
And, literally, I
have seen them with--

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:10%
teaching other acupuncturists.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have one person
feeling the patient's pulses

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.015 align:middle line:84%
from the right hand, and they'll
be on the left hand side.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:10%
And they can tell the person
on the right hand side

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:10%
whether or not they have
a smile on their face

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:10%
as they're feeling the pulses.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that amazing?

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Literally.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds crazy,
but I've seen this.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a believer.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:02:52.015 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.812 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, it's
like the Dalai Lama.

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:90%
You always see that smile.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is really
a spiritual aspect

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to smiling that is very healing,
just in itself, isn't it?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And it starts within.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I laugh at myself every day.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I wake up laughing and I
try to go to bed the same way.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You've got to hold things
in a certain light.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we need to really kind
of let it go and just like,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:90%
wasn't that interesting?

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That awful thing
that happened,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.123 align:middle line:90%
wasn't that interesting?

00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's not happening
to you, it's just happening.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're the focus
of it at that moment,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening at other
places in the world, too.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And the control that we
have is how we respond to those

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:90%
things that happen to us.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
That makes all the
difference in the world.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So as an
acupuncture physician,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is what you are, you
have a couple of favorite books

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:90%
that you absolutely love.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to
have recommendations--

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --on what people might
read if they want to just get

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:90%
the basics here.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:10%
And a couple of
them that you have--

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:10%
the "Traditional Acupuncture,
the Law of the Five Elements,"

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and "All Sickness is Home
Sickness," these two.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm an avid reader,
especially when it comes

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:10%
to Chinese therapies.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:10%
These two are two
of my favorite.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.508 align:middle line:10%
And then they were written by my
first acupuncture practitioner,

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:10%
who was also one of the
co-founders of the school

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:10%
that I went to, a
Dr. Dianne Connelly.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And the first book was actually
her thesis for her PhD.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:10%
And it explains the
law the five elements,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:10%
which is central to
Chinese medicine,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:10%
from the standpoint
of a layperson.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not full of
technical jargon.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you don't
have to be an acupuncturist

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you've brought a
chart of the five elements.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is the basis for
all of Chinese medicine.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, of Chinese philosophy?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's part of the basis.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Of the basis, itself,
is the unity of things.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at Chinese
numerology, you start with one,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:90%
the unity of everything.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Two is the first division
and that unity, yin and yang,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
complementary opposites, night
and day, male and female,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
up, down, right,
left, life and death.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Again, the balance.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>> From there you move to three,
which is the tension created

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
between the yin which is Earth,
and yang which is Heaven.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're stuck in the middle.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We're striving to be
heavenly, and yet we're

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:90%
rooted to the Earth.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, this tension is what
animates life, according

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.083 align:middle line:10%
to Chinese medical theory.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
four directions.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.292 align:middle line:10%
And after that, you
have the five elements,

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:10%
which is a cycle of
creation and self-checking.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:10%
For instance, you have wood
as one of the elements.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:10%
And the next element is fire.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, how do you create fire?

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
You need the fuel of the wood.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So these books that you
especially recommend

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
would get you
started toward that--

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
the book on the five elements.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, without
getting too technical,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a good very human way.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It's put into terms of patients
that she's actually treated

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and what their
experience was, and how

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that person can be examined
looking at the law of the five

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But I also love the
title of the other,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
which is "All Sickness
is Home Sickness."

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's home in
another sense, isn't it?

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> The big home.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It carries this right
back to the number one,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:90%
the unity of things.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:10%
The belief is that
once we separate--

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:10%
once we don't realize our
place within the oneness

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:10%
of everything and we separate
ourselves from nature, that's

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:10%
where illness is created.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is about
going back to the one,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.835 align:middle line:90%
going back to the unity.

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:26.635 align:middle line:90%
>> To the one.

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, going home.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Going home.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> When you and I had talked
you said, I use acupuncture.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:90%
That is my approach.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:90%
But, really, I am a healer.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
That is my purpose, and so
what you've found-- what is it

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that brought you to choosing
Chinese medicine and qigong?

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] We could go
on forever about this.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Personal experience.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Korea in the
1970s, 1971 and '72,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:90%
courtesy of Uncle Sam.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was an air
traffic controller,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and I was basically
up in the mountains.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And I got to visit the
temples that were in the area.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty isolated.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And the more I saw, the
more it gathered my interest.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And I saw acupuncture result
in some amazing turnarounds

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:90%
for people, healthwise.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it maintained a spot
somewhere in the back

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of my mind over the years.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed in and out of
it, that in the practice

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
of Tai Chi and martial arts.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was working as a
broker, believe it or not,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
at Merrill Lynch.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I can say Merrill
Lynch here, can't I?

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And I found myself in
a stressful situation.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And to relieve that
stress or to address it,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I went back to Tai Chi.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking,
you know, I'm--

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I came to the realization
I'm in the wrong business.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep at night.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
My skin was flaking and red.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just literally
scratch myself raw.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't love your job.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I really didn't.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I hated it, to
be frank with you.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's yin and yang.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Some people thrive on it.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> --I'm just not
one of those people.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So the more I went
back to my old studies,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:84%
the more it grabbed me and said,
yes, this is where you belong.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And I went home, so to speak.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to give us some
facts about acupuncture that

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
would be helpful.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:10%
I didn't realize that
every single acupuncture

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:10%
point has a name addressed
to it, like Heavenly Well.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese were-- number
one, the ancient Chinese

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't have things
that distracted them

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
from the oneness of nature.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.225 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have cable
TV, and fast food places,

00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So they were more in
harmony with themselves

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and their surroundings.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And through observation, at
length, thousands of years

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
literally, they realized that
not only was acupuncture good

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
for pain--

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.550 align:middle line:84%
number one, acupuncture
was originally

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:90%
used as a preventative medicine.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:10%
In ancient China, the
health care practitioner

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:10%
provided the service
and they only

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:10%
got paid as long as the
patient was healthy.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the
patient became ill,

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
they stopped paying until
they became healthy again.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient Chinese
were very, very observant.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that not only were

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:84%
certain points good
for the physical aspect

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:84%
of the treatment, but
they also addressed

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:90%
the mental and emotional states.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So a point like
Heavenly Well is not--

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
which, it's found right
now the elbow, by the way.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not only good
for, say, tennis

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
elbow and joint situations,
that sort of thing,

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.342 align:middle line:84%
but it's a place where mentally
you can go and be refreshed.

00:09:29.342 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of an
oasis, if you will.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we have a chart
that just shows, again,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
the meridians, OK, the lines,
the points, and so forth.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And, as you said,
this is just, then--

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
these points have

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:90%
energy flowing through them.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> There are 365 points,
which is interesting, 365.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, depending
on the tradition,

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
there can be a few extra points.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that energy
flows through the body.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It saturates the entire body.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But in the acupuncture
meridians, it's concentrated.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:10%
And it flows along
very specific channels.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And at various points
along those channels

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
it comes close to the
surface of the skin.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is where you can access
the energy through acupuncture

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
needles.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Those are the points.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you said the most
significant points are between

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:90%
the elbow and the fingertips.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:10%
>> I can't say one is more
significant than the other,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:10%
but these are the points that
are most frequently used--

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:10%
between the elbow and the
fingertips and the knees

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:10%
and the toes.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:10%
They're what's called
command points.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Most frequently used.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, do they relate to
other parts of the body?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.325 align:middle line:84%
Is it like the
reflexology concept, here?

00:10:42.325 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> They do relate to
other parts of the body.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Someone that has a headache
may get a needle in their leg.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So, yeah, it depends
on what's called for with

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
a particular individual.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you studied
this and you just--

00:10:54.505 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
it was just natural to you
and you just felt an affinity

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
toward this kind of
approach to health?

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt an affinity.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure how natural it was.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.415 align:middle line:90%
It's something I've worked at.

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've really
had to work at it.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
If there was some latent talent,
then I had to cultivate it.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that sprang up.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it
is with some people.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.032 align:middle line:84%
Some people know immediately
what they want to do

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
good at it and it

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:90%
seems to come natural to them.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Others of us have to work
at developing our skills

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:90%
a little more diligently.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I like the idea,
too, that you had a personal

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
experience of it when
you were living in Korea,

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
where you actually saw it used
and you saw the success of it.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And that must have just,
then, kind of stayed with you.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a friend of mine
who got sick one night.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a deep fried
chicken that he had eaten.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was literally
on his hands and knees

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
in the fetal position,
crying his eyes out.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And someone came-- they
went out and came back

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.207 align:middle line:90%
with this little woman.

00:11:54.207 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And she pulled out a little
black case of needles.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
exactly, but she put them

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
somewhere near the thumbs
and near his big toes.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And within two minutes,
he was up and around and back

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:90%
to his old self.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we also have
an example here.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are little,
and they are tiny.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And you said that we
could just kind of

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
see this is what the needle's
actually encapsulated in.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So it is a tiny
little needle, but it

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
is a powerful little needle
then, too, is it not?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The typical acupuncture
needle is about an inch long

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and about the diameter
of a human hair.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people have visions
of hypodermic needles.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
want to come see you.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.878 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
this needle phobia.

00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going
to take a break.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%
We need to.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to talk
about qigong and you're

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
going to do a demonstration
for us in the second segment.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So we will be right back
with more with Walter Haley

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.106 align:middle line:90%
and qigong.

00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Harmony and humor with
Chinese medicine with qigong--

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're doing today in
this program with Walter Haley.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
He has a favorite book that he
is sharing with his, "Qigong."

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And it is "The Art and Science
of Chinese Energy Healing."

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And you find humor
in the qigong, also?

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I do.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I find humor in everything.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:10%
>> At least to some degree
and at various times.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That book was written by Kenneth
Cohen, who is a Taoist priest

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.322 align:middle line:90%
living in Colorado.

00:13:24.322 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually
studied with him,

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
so I know his philosophy well.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the most
comprehensive book on qigong

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you from
square one to the end.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a graphic
that just says chi.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:10%
And it is what you said was
like the romanesque approach

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:10%
to the language, the
Chinese language.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:10%
And chi then, C-H-I, is
what most people see.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:90%
We think of that is energy.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that the definition of chi?

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Chi actually has a
number of definitions.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Life force is
certainly one of them.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:10%
The breath is another.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:10%
Anything that has the potential
to animate is, yet, another.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:10%
The Chinese idogram for chi
is a pot of rice, boiling.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And the steam
coming off the rice

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
represents the
energy that's derived

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
from grain, in this case.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:90%
And it moves.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the movement of life.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Its animation.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Its being alive.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Now qigong is with
the Q-I, is another--

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
is the preferred
Chinese spelling

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:90%
of the same thing, the--

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> --the Q-I.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The first spelling is
what's called Wade-Giles,

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
which was the first Romanization
of the Chinese language that

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:90%
was used on a wide basis.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese came
along and developed

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
what's called Pinion, which is
their official Romanization.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And they spelled it Q-I.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And what is qigong?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
If you were to give us a one
liner on qigong, what is it?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The act of cultivating
one's personal energy.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So you have done a
demonstration with us.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
seen Tai Chi done,

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and they have-- some
have seen qigong.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we note about it,
it is in very slow motion.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Most qigong exercises
are done very slowly.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:84%
There are some that are done
with some rapidity, though.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the one
that you have done,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
we want the audience
to do along with us.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:10%
But what is the
exercise that we're

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:10%
about to see that
you have done for us?

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This particular exercise
doesn't have a specific name.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But, in my experience,
it's the one exercise

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that I've found where, in a
fairly short period of time--

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
typically, my classes
are around 20 people.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
18 or 19 of the 20 people
will feel their own energy

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
with this exercise.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've never had that
sort of success rate

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
with any other one exercise in
such a short period of time.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone in our audience that
does this with you should be

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:90%
able to feel their own energy.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> More than likely.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going
to watch this now.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is in slow,
very slow motion.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you're doing now.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a commencement form.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I am basically gathering my
energy and bringing it down.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Energy has a tendency to rise.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
If you think of
heat, heat rises.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bringing it down and I'm
settling it in what the Chinese

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the dan t'ian, which
translates as-- essentially

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
as a lower elixir
field or sea of chi.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It's where the energy supposedly
is rooted in the body, right

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.235 align:middle line:90%
just below the navel area.

00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, right now
I'm just focusing.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm compacting my chi.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm trying
to concentrate it on the arms

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
or in my arms.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Right here, I'm crossing my
arms at two strategic points.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Just inside my right
wrist is a point

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:90%
known as Inner Frontier Gate.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And on the outside of my left
wrist is Outer Frontier Gate.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm drawing in and
giving out energy.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.228 align:middle line:90%
>> That balance, OK.

00:17:07.228 --> 00:17:09.145 align:middle line:84%
>> And, here, I'm just
reversing the position.

00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, we did that with you.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I was off camera, and a couple
of us participated with you.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.917 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
moving now, tell us

00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
what is this phase,
what you're doing.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:28.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Another very important
point on the poem called Lesser

00:17:28.835 --> 00:17:29.635 align:middle line:90%
Palace.

00:17:29.635 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Different traditions of
acupuncture-- different schools

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:84%
of acupuncture use slightly
different names, too.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And here I I'm just
pointing my two Lesser

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.952 align:middle line:90%
Palaces at each other.

00:17:42.952 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you not feeling
the energy between them?

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I am.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Your chi energy, then, is
focused between your two hands.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> And now I'm expanding it.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like pulling
taffy in this situation.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And, as we did this, we
were feeling the energy.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was our chi that we
were feeling as we were moving.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a very
subtle energy,

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.243 align:middle line:84%
which is why the movement
is done so slowly.

00:18:08.243 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
You can lift weights
or something.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And if you do it fast,
there's a certain energy

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:10%
involved but it's a gross
energy, where the healing

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:10%
energy is more subtle.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, for someone to do this,
what they would be doing

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.955 align:middle line:84%
would be experiencing
that and just noticing

00:18:24.955 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
what they're feeling.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
would recommend?

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
You want to do this
in a quiet place.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You want to do it when you're
in a relative state of calm.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:10%
And you want to just
pay real close attention

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:10%
to any sensation in the
hands or between the hands.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And you just planted your
feet and you're just held that

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You said that you were just
concentrating your energy,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
but it would be healing
to that part of the body

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
that we refer to as
the trunk of the body.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
This particular exercise
is very good for conditions

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that affect the
midline of the body--

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
digestive problems, heart
conditions, lower tract.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we notice your
finger there, too.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.618 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm just
focusing the energy.

00:19:06.618 --> 00:19:07.995 align:middle line:90%
I'm concentrating it.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The point that ends
at the middle finger

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is the point that I refer
to the Inner Palace.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, Lesser Palace.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:90%
This is where the channel ends.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Acupuncture channels all begin--

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:90%
number one, they spiral.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Energy spirals.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed that spiral
that you were doing.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.112 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at anything as
big as a hurricane all the down

00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to strands of DNA, there is
a spiraling into the energy.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
This particular
energetic channel

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:90%
ends at the middle finger.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And the yin channels end
and the yang channels

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.085 align:middle line:84%
begin at least, on
the hand, in this way.

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
energy is most volatile.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's most easily affected
by using those points.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, at the end
you're coming--

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
you're holding the energy here.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm refocusing and calming.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I want to keep
the energy from going up.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm literally grabbing
it and pulling it back down.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to embrace
it and bring it back down

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to the-- again, the
lower dan t'ian.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.617 align:middle line:84%
>> And you did rush
through this a little bit.

00:20:19.617 --> 00:20:21.242 align:middle line:84%
You would normally
have done it slower.

00:20:21.242 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This is probably done
about twice as fast as I would

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
normally do it.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
done bilaterally.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.172 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
process is mirrored

00:20:29.172 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
with the opposite side.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of that
concept of balance.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, exactly.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And the dan t'ian is where
you store the energy,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's we always
bring the focus back to.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a point just below--
an acupuncture point just below

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
the navel called Sea of Chi.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Chi being energy--
that's where it's rooted.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Now Tai Chi-- people are
seeing that more offered

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
in places like YMCAs
and that sort of thing.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between Tai Chi and qigong?

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Tai Chi is actually
a type of qigong.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government
says that as of 1997, there

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:84%
were 37,000 different
qigong forms and exercises.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Tai Chi is simply one of them.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The basic difference in Tai Chi
and most other forms of qigong

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is the repetition that
you find with qigong

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
that is not normally
found so much in Tai Chi.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Why does this heal?

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What is it about this
particular type of movement

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in this way of
concentrating our focus that

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
is very helpful for us?

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Due to the tensions
of day-to-day life,

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
we tense our muscles, the
stresses, and it literally--

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
a tense body will
stop the flow of chi.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
By relaxing and calming
with these slow movements

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
you allow the muscles
and joints to relax.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:90%
The energy flows more smoothly.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad that you have
brought this energy to us.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.462 align:middle line:84%
And we appreciate
the demonstration.

00:21:51.462 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And they smile while
they do it, by the way.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:54.826 align:middle line:90%
>> That's key.

00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:55.322 align:middle line:90%
That's key.

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's key.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.535 align:middle line:84%
So we must be smiling as
we're moving through this.

00:21:58.535 --> 00:21:59.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You also have a
newsletter that people,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to be
in touch with you,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.993 align:middle line:90%
could get your newsletter, too.

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.138 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a way that
you can be in touch with Walter.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haley has found
a way that he can share

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and he can serve other people.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:84%
He has found that Chinese
medicine, and especially

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
qigong, are very powerful
for harmony, and for humor,

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
for health, and for healing.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:90%
We appreciate that.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

May you be well,
happy and peaceful.
