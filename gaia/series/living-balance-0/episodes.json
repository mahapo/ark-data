To overcome pain, it helps to realize that our pain isn't personal; instead it comes from the pain body.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a collective pain body that comes from sub-populations by race, geography, gender, etc.  For instance, women have an extensive pain body because of past sufferings in history and it especially is present right before menstruation.

The \"negative egos\" are lust, laziness, gluttony, envy, pride, anger, and greed.  \r\n\r\nGeorgia points out the similarities between the Negative Egos of the Incans and the Deadly Sins of the Bible.  The second step is to master kundalini energy.  Again, Georgia points out the universality found in the Incan teachings, as \"kundalini energy\" is typically associated with Hinduism.
