00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you
to "Living in Balance" today.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:10%
We are going to learn how we
can maximize our potential.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.540 align:middle line:10%
It is part of the
American dream.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.642 align:middle line:84%
Come join us, "Living in
Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Wood is a success story.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And he is sharing his
success with other people.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
There are techniques
that can help you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to share the American dream.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
So, Andrew Wood, welcome.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to you.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm really pleased
that you could come today.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I had talked
with you about your being

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
a motivational speaker because
you share so much positive,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
as far as the message
that you have.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
But you said you
really would rather

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
think of yourself as maximizing
potential within people.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of negativity, perhaps,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:90%
or I don't know.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody
asks what do I do,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I never say I'm a
motivational speaker.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not somebody that
will go in and hype somebody up

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:90%
into feeling good.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
What I really want to
do is make a difference

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in somebody's life, to give
them some skills that they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
can be a self-motivator.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a maximizer.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I try to help them get the
most out of themselves.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And that makes them motivated.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, everyone
out there has a potential.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And some are reaching it.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Most of us could really
do better, could we not?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we could be happier.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:90%
We could be more fulfilled.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
We could be serving others more.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As Henry David Thoreau said,
most people live lives of quiet

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%
desperation.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, most people seriously
underutilize the potential

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
they have in them.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:10%
And they are not,
then, having any

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:10%
of those wonderful
feelings that we have

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:10%
when we are doing a good job.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Like my one sister had said,
that you feel so good when

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
you're contributing, and
when you are successful,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and you've made that sale
or you've done that thing.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a wonderful
motivator, just in itself.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of a
self-fulfilling part.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's real motivation
rather than fake motivation.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
When you are doing something
you're passionate about--

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing something you
believe in, like you are doing

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
or like I'm doing, it's
easy to get excited

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.223 align:middle line:84%
and to be really motivated, as
opposed to go into a seminar

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
or listening to tapes
and just kind of getting

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
jazzed up until you get back
home and have to pay the bills,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> But I loved your story.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Because you came to the United
States with a suitcase and $300

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:10%
bucks.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
My 18th birthday present
was a one-way ticket

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
to America, $300.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That was it.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That was it.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, you
have come a long way.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to
brag about yourself.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But would you share with
us where you are right now,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:90%
what you have come since then?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I started out wanting to
become a golf professional.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was reasonably
good at golf.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
But golf, as most major sports
are, was a very pointy pyramid.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:90%
And good was not good enough.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So lack of talent held me
back from fulfilling my dream

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:90%
of being on the PGA TOUR.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But I got involved in
the karate business,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and over the last
10 years have built

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
one of the largest chains of
karate schools in the world.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And, in the process,
have got all the things

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
people would like to
get, such as the money

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and the cars and the homes.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a lot of fun.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.152 align:middle line:10%
Well, in talking with
your staff they said,

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:10%
well, he'll drive
up in his Ferrari.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought, now, that
is a success story.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] So you're enjoying it.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I certainly am.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think, you know, a
mistake a lot of people make is

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that in setting goals and
striving to do better,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
they kind of give up
life in the process.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to think that's
something that we haven't done

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in our company and our
business, in that, yes,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
we're very motivated
to help people

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and to share our
books and our seminars

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and our audio programs
with other people.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But the journey has
to be fun, as well.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.214 align:middle line:90%
Now, the books and so forth--

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
you have a whole
series of tapes.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:84%
And we have a graphic on that,
that has some of the tapes.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
ways that you share.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And you get out in
front of the people.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But you said, it's not
enough just to hear it.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
How nice it is if you
can reinforce that, too.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:10%
So you like to actually assist
people in different ways.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
My real passion in life is
to help people maximize.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I do a lot of
seminars, a lot

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of speaking for corporations
and associations.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But just doing it
one day isn't enough.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
You can get somebody excited
and you can give somebody

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
some of the tools,
but we all know

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that to make meaningful
change in our lives

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't happen like that.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I've dedicated
the last couple

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
of years to really sitting down
and producing these products so

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that people can go
home and continue

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
the process of learning
and discovering how

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:90%
to maximize their potential.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we're finding
is that often negativity will

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
creep in to our thinking process
because of the outside world.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So we do have to
have techniques,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.708 align:middle line:84%
like affirmations or tapes that
we listen to, books that we--

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
we were just talking about
that, one of my staff and I.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
important to keep that up.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I asked you if you could
share with people on not just

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the techniques that
are successful.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
What are the blockages?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:10%
What keeps people
from being successful,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:10%
from feeling that wonderful
feeling of success

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.385 align:middle line:10%
and positive thinking?

00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the greatest
thing, Georgia,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that holds most people
back is limitations--

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
mental limitations about what
they think they can or cannot

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.687 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
my favorite stories--

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:52.222 align:middle line:84%
I've just finished doing a
program with Brian Tracy called

00:05:52.222 --> 00:05:53.305 align:middle line:90%
"The Traits of Champions."

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very interesting
program close to my heart

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
because what it is, is
how to succeed in life

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:90%
told through golfing anecdotes.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a story about
somebody actually very locally,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Calvin Peete.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
At 24 years old, he'd never
played golf in his life.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
He was one of 19 children, the
son of a migrant farm worker.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.335 align:middle line:84%
And he started playing
golf when he was 24.

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
He immediately decided he was
going to get on the PGA TOUR,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
gave up farm working for $100
a week, and within 10 years

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
was the leading money
winner on the PGA TOUR.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And to date, he's
won $5 or $6 million.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
He's playing on the
senior tour now.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Big dreams.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very important not to
let other people tell you

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:90%
what you can or can't do.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got to dream
those big dreams.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
But there are certain--

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of hard work.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just get from
your suitcase and $300

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to the position you are right
now without working hard.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that an element?

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.878 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we really have
to put the energy out there

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't feel like
work because we love it?

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's the key.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that be
successful in any field you

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
have to put out the hard
work, and the energy,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and the perspiration.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
The key is to do something
that you love doing so

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.285 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't feel like work.

00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
If I won the lotto
tomorrow, I keep

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:84%
doing what I'm doing because
I love what I'm doing.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's really a key aspect.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That is the test, isn't it?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.542 align:middle line:84%
And that happens, it's
kind of interesting,

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
when someone has won the
lottery or something,

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to give up their job.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
They really have enjoyed
what they have been doing.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And that would be the
test, would it not?

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it really is.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Would you keep doing
what you're doing now,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:90%
if you won the lottery?

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
If the answer to
that question is no,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:90%
then that tells you something.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But what about the person
who-- and this morning,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
this happened with a
young man who called.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking
about he hated his job,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:10%
and he doesn't know whether
he can give that up because he

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:10%
has a wife and he has a child.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:10%
So there is a
responsibility aspect.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, what do you
say to this man who

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:10%
has a good, responsible
job with a secure income

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:10%
but he doesn't like it?

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a wonderful question
because that's the place where

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:90%
so many people are.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
in a job they hate

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
or a business they don't like or
basically defending a position

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:90%
they've had already taken.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do that is to
come up with a transitional

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
stage. , Obviously
somebody like that is--

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
the best thing for his family
is not going to be if he ups

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and quits his lousy job and
goes and does something else.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So the key in
those situations is

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to start transitioning
over to a plan B.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
What could he do
in his spare time?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:90%
What could he do on weekends?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say he was
into model trains.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
What could he do
at the swap meet

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
on the weekend to turn that--

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and many of my
clients have turned

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:84%
hobbies or secondary businesses,
doing them on nights,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:84%
doing them on weekends, into
full blown businesses a year

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:90%
or two years down the line.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And if he is--

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
if it is his hobby and
he's really enjoying it,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
then he won't mind putting
in those extra hours.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:90%
So that would make sense.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:10%
Whatever it is he loves to do--

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.955 align:middle line:10%
>> --that he could.

00:09:00.955 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And just sort of look at
what is the market for it.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
If he's a musician
or if he is an artist

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever and he'd like
to support himself totally

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
in that way, still,
he can be responsible

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.503 align:middle line:90%
because he can just sort of--

00:09:13.503 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Transition into it.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --make that transition.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And I think the other thing--

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I have a program out called
"The Sponge Principle."

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, more
than anything else,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is the real key to addressing
a situation like this.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You know what you
know and that's

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:90%
what got you where you are.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You know what you don't know
and that's why you read books

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%
and you get tapes.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's what you
don't know you don't

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
know that will kill you or
at least determine where

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
you go or don't go in life.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a total sponge
for information.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Especially today in
the information age,

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.965 align:middle line:90%
you've got the internet.

00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:90%
You've got libraries.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You've got audiotapes,
videotapes, seminars.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.557 align:middle line:84%
You can become an expert
on almost anything.

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally you could
become a brain surgeon

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in the next five years if
that's what you wanted to do.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They demonstrate it on
The Learning Channel.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So "The Sponge Principle,"
the information you want to be

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
in your own business-- to
transition into another field--

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to start again all together--
the information is out there.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the absolute
key traits to success

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:90%
is not to reinvent the wheel.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Go find out the
mistakes and problems

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
other people have solved in
that very situation you're

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.395 align:middle line:90%
trying to transition into.

00:10:21.395 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>> And, as you said--

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:10%
we were talking about a book.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think there is a book in
you and you want to write that,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
there is even a way that
you can self-publish.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.262 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the
library and you can

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:90%
get a book on self-publishing.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
There is information out there
from all the different media

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:90%
that you could gain.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, so be a sponge.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I love the idea
of what you said, too,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:90%
like don't limit yourself.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Don't allow limitations.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:10%
But what if you are in
a circumstance where

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:10%
you don't have the support
around you of people

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:10%
who are encouraging
you to do your best?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Brian Tracy, whom
I just worked with on this

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:90%
previous program, said it best.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
If it's to be, it's up to me.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And, certainly, we would
like to surround ourselves

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
with supportive people.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we should
endeavor to look

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
for supportive relationships.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But, very often, they
don't happen at once.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have to really take
charge of your own destiny.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:90%
That's another key trait.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the
support isn't there.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.040 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
live with this fact

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that the support
isn't there, and take

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:90%
charge of your own destiny.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line, we are responsible.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:10%
>> We can't put it
out there against--

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:10%
that someone else isn't
helping us or supporting us.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:10%
It's nice, though,
if you do have

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:10%
that kind of loving support.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.385 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the responsibility--
look at our country today.

00:11:43.385 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything boils
down to one thing.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
All the problems we see
with gangs, and drugs,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and all the negativity boil
down to people not wanting

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for their own actions.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why responsibility
for your own actions is

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
so critical to success.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I am so excited about
the materials that you have.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:90%
There are books and so forth.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:10%
So there is more
for us to share.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:10%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And we are going to help
you, with Andrew Wood,

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.282 align:middle line:10%
maximize your potential.

00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:15.138 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:12:15.138 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The book is "Making
it Big in America."

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
The author is Andrew Wood.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
He is really living
the American dream.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And in here you share
your experience.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
How was it better for you to
come to the United States?

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:84%
You left England,
which we both love.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I think
England's a wonderful country.

00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that there
isn't opportunity in England.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But America is the land
of the American dream.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just
so much easier here.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The people are more receptive
to the entrepreneurial spirit

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:84%
here than they are
anywhere else in the world.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And that really
gives you the edge.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I see that with people.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The enthusiasm of
the individual--

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.400 align:middle line:84%
there is an individualist
quality to the entrepreneur.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And it really is admired.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
In the book, tell us a little
bit more about your story.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.125 align:middle line:84%
You had some difficulties
as you moved through this.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I know one of the
things you said

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was you moved to
California and you

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to be moving
into a job with a friend

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%
with a limousine service.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I had originally
moved out to California.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.707 align:middle line:84%
I had a golf scholarship down in
West Palm Beach Junior College.

00:13:19.707 --> 00:13:21.373 align:middle line:10%
And then, when that
was kind of through,

00:13:21.373 --> 00:13:23.480 align:middle line:10%
I moved out to California
to drive a limo.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And within about four weeks,
the business went under.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
accidentally got involved

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:90%
in the karate business.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was fortunate in
the karate business.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I bought a school
off my instructor,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't quite making
enough money to live.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I did what everybody
else in the karate business did.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I opened another
school, figuring

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that if I didn't make
quite enough money in one

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.272 align:middle line:84%
business and not quite enough
money in another business

00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:48.717 align:middle line:84%
and put them together,
then that would work.

00:13:48.717 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, it didn't.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's really when I came
up with this idea of "The Sponge

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Principle."

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I sat down
with a piece of paper and said,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:90%
is this what I want to do?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:90%
The answer was yes.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I do it?

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
understand the first thing

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:84%
about running a business or
advertising or marketing.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.055 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to the
local bookstore.

00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I bought 28 books on
how to design an ad.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Read them all in a month.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Literally, in one month,
I read a book a day,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%
underlining, highlighting.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I went back into my karate
business, redesigned

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the first ad I ever did in my
life that actually made sense.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:90%
The phone started ringing.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.425 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, well, gee.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
If I can learn
about advertising,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
maybe I could learn
about sales like that.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Went back-- all of
a sudden, now when

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
people called I actually
was able to sign them up.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, within a
period of about six months,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I went from making $7,000 a
year to making $7,000 or $8,000

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:90%
a month.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty
significant financial change.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHS] Well, you
obviously found, then,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:10%
techniques that absolutely work
and that's what you're sharing

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:10%
through your--

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what I've tried
to do in "Making it Big."

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --tapes and things.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very much a
step-by-step process.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not a feel good thing.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It's, OK, this is what
you need to do if you

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
want to get from here to there.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are
essentially 12 traits,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
starting with big dreams
and ending with persistence.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And probably the
two most important,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
other than those two, are
setting goals for yourself

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how
to solve problems.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Problem solving is
really the master skill

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
of life, in that
where you are today

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to get
where you want to go

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
is completely related to your
ability to solve problems.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
If you can solve
problems, you immediately

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:90%
graduate to bigger problems.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And the bigger problems you
graduate to, the better you do

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
not doing very well,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:90%
then your problems are meager.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You just have to find
enough money to eat or live.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It's when you really
become good at problem

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
solving that your problems
become very complex.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
know you're doing good.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So you will
get bigger problems

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%
that you'll be able to solve.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] That is progress.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So, from that, you have
found, then, that there are--

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
series of CDs, too.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
In addition to "The
Sponge Principle,"

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:90%
"The Legendary Leadership."

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a series on the
traits of power, influence

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:90%
and effectiveness.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this series
that you have

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
done, what you're talking
about is the successful people,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and what are the traits that
you see across the board there.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I've done a tremendous
amount of research,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
both in person and in reading.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds and hundreds
of biographies

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and studying famous people.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And legendary leadership
is a very important skill

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
leaders to somebody.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:90%
We are leaders to our family.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
We might be leaders to
the little league team.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.470 align:middle line:84%
We might be leaders to
schoolchildren, whatever.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So understanding leadership
is a very important skill

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is
studied these traits

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.018 align:middle line:84%
of what is it that causes us
to follow and influence people.

00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And the traits on "Legendary
Leadership"-- again, there

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
are 12 traits that are
slightly different.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But the first of those
traits is vision.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
What is it you
want to accomplish?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Where is it you want to go?

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want to
lead your team to?

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know we've talked
with people who work with

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:90%
businesses.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:10%
They go in and they say, the
first thing you have to do

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:10%
is write your vision statement.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You need to know
where you're going,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to do,
OK, or a mission statement.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to do
that as individuals

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
in any part of our lives--
know what it is we want.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.389 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to have an
understanding of where

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:84%
it is we want to be,
if you don't like

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
and are just absolutely ecstatic
about where we are right now.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And so that's important.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the second trait
of legendary leaders,

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
which is also very applicable
to personal success, is passion.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to be passionate
about achieving this vision.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:90%
If the vision is not yours--

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:84%
if the vision is not something
you're passionate about,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going to
make the sacrifice or put

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
in the hard work-- and, believe
me, you have to do both--

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to get what it
where it is you want to go.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, that is the
one thing that I find with

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
people that I interview
for this show.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:90%
They do have a passion.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And you and I talked
about that earlier.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They are driven to do it
because it is so important,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and it works so well, and
it helps so many people.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:90%
They can't help but do it.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.307 align:middle line:90%
That's that kind of feeling.

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people simply
don't know what their passion

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
You ask nine people out of
10, what is it you want to do?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Gee, I don't know.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They literally spend
more time thinking

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.893 align:middle line:84%
about where they're going
to go on vacation than they

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
do what they want to do
with the rest of their life.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And, how do you
get them, then,

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
from the vacation
to their career?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you move the people
from-- they understand

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, I want to do this.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I love to do this.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in Hawaii.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But how do we move that
kind of energy into career?

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, a lot of
times people simply don't know

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
what they want to do
because, as Henry Ford said,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
thinking is the
hardest work there is.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
They've never sat down.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I often find in
my seminars that when

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
people say that to me, I
kind of reverse it on them

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, what is it
you don't want to do?

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to go down the
coal mines and dig for coal

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.635 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to pick
up garbage for a living?

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:03.698 align:middle line:84%
If you can't figure out
what you want to do,

00:19:03.698 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
start listing the whole of
things you don't want to do.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And see what's left
at the end of the day.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So that is reverse psychology
that will work on that.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And as people start to like look
inside and say, OK, what is it,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
they really are
accomplishing a lot.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they're getting
to know themselves.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Are they not?

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a real
positive step, too.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the process of actually
just sitting down and really

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:90%
planning out your life, saying--

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I have this little bit
on one of my programs

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.955 align:middle line:84%
called Whitewater
Rafting at 101.

00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was one day, I
was sitting down listing off

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
my goals, and actually taking
them and putting a timeline

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that
whitewater rafting

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to happen
until I was 101 years old.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.857 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how much
fun it's going to be, then.

00:19:53.857 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to sit down
and not just write down

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:84%
a list of dreams or
things you want to do,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but you have to timeline it, and
start doing something about it.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have taken
this through-- then

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:90%
we have the series of tapes.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Now these are "Selling
with Confidence,"

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:90%
so they're specific.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, this one
is specific to someone

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:90%
who is in sales.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But "Making it Big, How to Get
Ahead in Business and in Life,"

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.663 align:middle line:84%
that would apply
across the board?

00:20:24.663 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> "Making it Big" is
very much for everybody.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But before we leave the sales
one, let me just say this.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I think this is
a point many people miss.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is in sales.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Sales is such an
incredible skill,

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to be involved

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in the profession
of selling cars

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
or compute systems
or anything else.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You need to sell
yourself to get a job.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You need to sell
yourself to get a spouse.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You need to sell
yourself to get a raise.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And so even people
who say, gee, I

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
don't want anything
to do with sales--

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.923 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand it's
just that anything is sales.

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You are selling yourself.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:10%
>> And so, selling
with confidence--

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:10%
and why do most people not like
selling or why are most people

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:10%
not good at selling?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:90%
There it is-- confidence.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And so while that
program is designed

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:84%
for people involved
in sales, it's

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
very applicable for
anybody who just

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:90%
wants to get ahead in life.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But, yes, "Making it Big"
is more focused on that.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> But it is true.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember someone,
when they approached me,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:84%
they said, gosh, you'd
make a great salesman.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.267 align:middle line:84%
Because she was just
listening to what--

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:25.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you would.

00:21:25.067 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
the absolute number

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.653 align:middle line:84%
one key for being a great
salesman-- enthusiasm.

00:21:28.653 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that is
important isn't it?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Forget everything else.

00:21:31.153 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Forget the skills,
the hype, the close.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.637 align:middle line:84%
Enthusiasm-- number one skill
for being a great salesperson.

00:21:36.637 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:90%
You've got plenty of that.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And that comes
back to you love it.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You love what you're
doing, and that's

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
where the enthusiasm comes.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody's
good at something.

00:21:43.445 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a special
talent, whether it's people,

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's sales, whether
it's whatever it is.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And sit down and do
a quick inventory.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
What are you good at?

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Who do you know?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
What is it you would
really like to be doing,

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that you could align with those
things you feel you're good at?

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you're not good at them,
take The Sponge Principle.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Take that one thing you
wish you were great at

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and go out and become
an expert in it.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Buy the books.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the tapes.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to be good at what
it is you want to be good at.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%
That is wonderful.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%

I think it serves you so well.
