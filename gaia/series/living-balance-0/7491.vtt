00:00:01.088 --> 00:00:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to welcome
you to our program today.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I am so excited.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
We have a storyteller,
and his story

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is about a journey
to self-healing.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Come join us, "Living in
Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Terry McBride is a
man with a purpose.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And his purpose is to share
his wisdom and his light,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
because he has
been through pain.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:90%
He has been through tragedy.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
And he has a success story.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So I am so pleased to
welcome Terry McBride.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Georgia.

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a delight to be here.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well you know, you have
told me so many good stories,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I wish the camera had been
rolling while we were chatting

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:90%
ahead of time.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But you did just mention
that you had 30 surgeries.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So you really do have a
story of self-healing.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what has
happened to Terry McBride

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and what brought you
to where you are today.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>> In a nutshell.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I had hurt my
back when I was 22.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a spinal fusion.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Somehow during
surgery, the spine

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
got infected with
the E. coli bacteria.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And over the next
11 years, I had

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.555 align:middle line:84%
a total of 30
surgical procedures

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%
dealing with the infection.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.473 align:middle line:84%
>> And around the 10th one I was
transferred to the University

00:01:29.473 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of Washington Hospital,
big teaching hospital,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
because it kept spreading.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So my physician
referred me there

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because they had all the experts
under one roof kind of thing.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And the night of
the 10th surgery,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
they came in and
said we're going

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.425 align:middle line:84%
to do this very radical
debridement, which essentially,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
they're going to cut out
all the infected material.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.147 align:middle line:84%
And they said when
we're done with this,

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose the use
of your right leg, probably

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:90%
the use of your left leg.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a good chance you'll
lose the control of your bowels

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and bladder, and you'll
probably be sexually impotent.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't have really
given a worse scenario.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.545 align:middle line:84%
>> And they weren't
being negative.

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
What they were
saying was this is

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.585 align:middle line:84%
the worst case of osteomyelitis
of the spine we've ever seen.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's in your abdomen.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.367 align:middle line:90%
It's in your pelvic area.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We think there's a
hole in your colon.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's down your back, your
buttocks into the upper thighs

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
as it's gone down
the sciatic nerves.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.483 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
open you from the front

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and the back and the bottom.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we're done, you just
cannot expect to come out

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:90%
of this one whole.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Not what wanted to hear.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Not at all, oh no.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And now today, you're
fine and you're perfect.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was at
the 10th surgery.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
So a lot happened in between.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It did.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
That was when--

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I think an awful
lot of the audience,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and you and I, can
remember when we show up

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're these happy
little kids going here I am.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.235 align:middle line:84%
And we learn real
early in school

00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that the teacher supposedly
knows more about us than we do.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And we allow them to tell
whether we're a good student,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
whether we're good in math, or
good in sports or music, that.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always sort of looked
outside of myself for who I am.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I showed
up and was sick,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I just expected
somebody else to fix me.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And that had always
happened before.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But then all of the sudden,
I got one of those--

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
you know when a
person has surgery

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.255 align:middle line:84%
and they say there's
a small chance you

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
could get an infection,
well, I was the small chance.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.038 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
have an infection,

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a small chance
this could be real serious

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and we might not get rid of it.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept buying it until
one day, they pushed too far

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and said, you're going to
lose the use of your body.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
listen to you anymore.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And I started studying.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I started the books
and the people that you've had

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
on your show and you
talked about, I mean,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.772 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I've read
some of their books and gone,

00:03:37.772 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:90%
[GASP] that's me!

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I can be well too.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:90%
If they can do it, I can do it.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the journey of
self discovery, which is true.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And you really said, now,
what I want to share,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:90%
because it's the story--

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I got the
material for my life from.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But what you want to share is
the principles that you learned

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
can be, then, used in
every part of your life.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And every person can
benefit from the principles.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I think an awful lot of
us today have grown up

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:90%
believing that we're our stuff.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:90%
There are so many labels.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I do is I
travel around now and speak

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.515 align:middle line:90%
at metaphysical organizations.

00:04:23.515 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of the
metaphysicians I meet

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
ought to paste Velcro on the
back of their hand and Velcro

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of their forehead.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And then when you say,
so how are things,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
they can throw their
hand up and it'll stick.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, I'm having
wonderful opportunities

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:90%
for growth.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's no joy
in that, you know?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I began to see
was there was a consistency,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that the great
spiritual teachers--

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
you know that Jewish mystic
2,000 years ago when he said

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
all things are possible
if you believe they are?

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Start at the idea that
consciousness creates reality.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And then of course now we
have wonderful teachers

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
like Deepak Chopra that says
the body regenerates itself

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
every 12 months.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to regenerate itself

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:90%
the way it used to.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
We can make new decisions
about how it's to regenerate.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.645 align:middle line:84%
And it was those
kinds of things--

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
although Deepak hadn't
written his book back then--

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
but there were still
great books that

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
spoke to something within me
that wasn't my disease, that

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
wasn't my infection, something
that was in me that that wasn't

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
my propensity towards drama,
something that was in me that I

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
could get in touch
with and use that

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.275 align:middle line:84%
to step forth newly each day and
begin to create a new reality.

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And that was out of choice.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And you said, and I liked your
line, everyone can be free.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of those
thoughts that I think

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:90%
we need to hold sometimes.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can be free.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
embellish that?

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, when I
say everyone can be free,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people will
come up and say, oh,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got a friend and they're in
the hospital and they're doing

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.988 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to go tell
them that they can get well.

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And I ask him, have they
read any of these books?

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Are they into this?

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no they haven't.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wouldn't go in there
and say, well you can be free.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:90%
You know, you are free.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But what we'd
gently talk about is

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
there is a possibility
that you can be free.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And what that's about is I
can change my belief systems,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean simplistically.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I can change my attitudes
and, therefore, approach life

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.938 align:middle line:90%
from a new point of view.

00:06:28.938 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's where to
start in the beginning.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
walk up to people

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
who've never been exposed,
never had any demonstrations

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
in their life, and say, you know
that you can create reality,

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:90%
because that's like--

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
but it starts out,
well you know you

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
can make a little
difference in your life.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
practice these things

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.057 align:middle line:84%
and they make a
little difference.

00:06:47.057 --> 00:06:49.573 align:middle line:84%
And it's like wow, I wonder
if I practice them some more

00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
if I can make a bigger
difference and a bigger

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
difference?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then one day it's
like, I think I can begin

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:90%
to make my dreams come true.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moving from
what Henry David Thoreau said,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.745 align:middle line:84%
people lead lives
of quiet desperation

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
where they think they're
stuck in their jobs, stuck

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in their health, stuck in
relationships that consistently

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
don't work, to a new
awareness about self

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to make
their dreams come true.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And then life becomes joy.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and what I like about
what you're saying is that

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
books are there to
empower, to inspire.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:90%
There is wonderful information.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's not all brand new.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are new
approaches to it.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And you never know
what just might

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
resonate with each person.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But it is the old
universal truths

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:90%
that these things are so.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And that point
you made, you know,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll never know what
resonates with a person--

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if somebody
goes into the library

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and looks at the books,
there's all these list books.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The 10 this, the nine this, the
20 this, the 40 this, the 20--

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.893 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, you look at
it and there's 27 books.

00:07:55.893 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You add up their
lists and there's

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:90%
675 things I need to do.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
get discouraged.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And the thing for me was
to read through books

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and then just be aware.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And when there was something
in there that was important,

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
well you had the angel
sitting over your shoulder.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was as if
there was an angel going

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.413 align:middle line:90%
this was a good one.

00:08:18.413 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And other times it
came from within that

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
went [GASP] this one I can use.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's like that, to explore
these ideas and be aware.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And all the great
spiritual teachings

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
say when you're honestly
seeking, you're not alone.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you
created this pretty--

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
in a very difficult
situation for yourself.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You went through 30 surgical
procedures to get there.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, were you resisting?

00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Were you a little bit of
a slow learner, Terry,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
because you see--

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, people ask me,
why did you have 30?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hello.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Or you know--

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> At a point.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:90%
But you really do have to walk.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to walk through what
is your journey, do you not?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you
know there is an idea

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the literature that
talks about group consciousness

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
or race consciousness,
that kind of thing.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there were
as many-- at least I

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't read about them--
as many people who

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
beat million-to-one
odds back in the '60s.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they did it, but
it wasn't out there as much.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the
wrestling match

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.938 align:middle line:90%
was I felt like I was all alone.

00:09:19.938 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I felt there was a
divine presence with me.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And I call that presence god.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.865 align:middle line:84%
And I know people who
call it something else.

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking the
same thing, I think.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But as far as how to apply
these principles of choice

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and create a new reality, I
felt like I was all alone.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the beauties of shows

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:84%
like this is that it allows
people to begin to experience,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:90%
If she can do it, I can do it.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
If he can do it, I can do it,
because they were just like me.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And they started
from not necessarily

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
in the best household
and the best childhood.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But they learned
through themselves.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And it took a while.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get-- I was
sick for 11 years.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But this story has this
wonderful and happy ending.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And its beginning too, because
you are sharing your story.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And it is true.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we get a lot of email
from our audience and things,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and I will get
someone who will say,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I was inspired from this show.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why what
you're doing here

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is you're sharing
what is a miracle.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you are healed.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you look
really healthy.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I am very healthy.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm 55.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- with all
those surgeries,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a bad back.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.043 align:middle line:84%
I'm not recovering
from a bad back.

00:10:33.043 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't learned to
live within my limitations.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If you will stay tuned, we
will be right back with Terry

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.585 align:middle line:90%
McBride.

00:10:39.585 --> 00:10:43.465 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:43.465 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
If you are just
joining us, we're

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.027 align:middle line:84%
talking with Terry McBride
and he's telling us

00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:57.637 align:middle line:90%
a terrible and wonderful story.

00:10:57.637 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And the terrible part
and the wonderful part

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%
is that you've been through
it and you are doing--

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
you're sharing your light now.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.017 align:middle line:84%
And there is a principle
by which you live.

00:11:06.017 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And I like this one.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to
embellish, if you would.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Eliminate negative emotions
and limiting decisions.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, tell me about that.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> What I think--

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
how I hold negative emotions
are if we don't learn

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
how to resolve, like say
anger or fear or guilt

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or those kinds of
unworthiness, then when

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
we're in a situation
when anger comes up,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.123 align:middle line:90%
so will all the rest of it.

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like when
people are in there

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.248 align:middle line:84%
and they feel an anger
that's much bigger

00:11:30.248 --> 00:11:31.648 align:middle line:90%
than the current situation.

00:11:31.648 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There are some
wonderful techniques--

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't presume to
say that the ones I teach are

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:90%
the only ones--

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to allow us to get so
that our past is not

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:90%
burdened with the emotions.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Like when I talk about my
surgeries and talk about what

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
happened-- and some of
them were very radical--

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.013 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have an
emotional charge.

00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't sit around
and go, (WEEPY VOICE)

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
oh, I remember
when they did that.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can remember
when they did that.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But I've eliminated
this feeling.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I understand
exactly what you mean,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost like if
you were sharing that with me,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:90%
I could feel your pain.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean literally, it
is the kind of thing

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that that just
goes out from you.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around
you still knows

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
if you're holding the
anger, the upset, right?

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think some people, when
they talk, they still have it.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.282 align:middle line:84%
And when people walk
away, I don't know

00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:90%
that they walk away inspired.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:84%
They feel filled with pain,
and boy, wasn't that terrible.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think we can get rid
of that, which then allows

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:90%
us to move into our lives--

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and I use the term
joy and delight,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
but in the middle of it, I
wasn't joyful and delightful.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But at least I wasn't
carrying this heavy stuff.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And the idea of limit--

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of
limiting decisions

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are things like people
grow up in an environment

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
where a little
girl's growing up.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.578 align:middle line:84%
And the people around
are saying you know,

00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:90%
everybody in our family is fat.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
We're probably--
you know, you're

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.028 align:middle line:90%
probably going to have fat.

00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And so at some little age,
this little girl goes,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm probably going to be fat.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.402 align:middle line:84%
Then later, she's dealing with
weight and dealing with weight

00:12:58.402 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with
weight and dealing

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
with weight, when at
an unconscious level,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
she has made a
decision, I'm fat.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
techniques out there

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
where we can eliminate
those negative emotions

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and limiting decisions
so I can start fresh.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the idea that we
don't have to be our past.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, what is your favorite
simple technique to get rid

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:90%
of negative emotions?

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
How can-- can you
share something

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that's easy just
to peel something,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:90%
to allow something to go?

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful
discipline called

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
neurolinguistic programming.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Some guys started it 20
years ago with the idea--

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.437 align:middle line:84%
and they brought a bunch of
techniques under an umbrella.

00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And most of the techniques
were already out there.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like they discovered
a whole bunch of new things.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things in there
is called timeline therapy.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to go into it now.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is we can
move back in our memory.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:10%
If we get quiet, get
in touch with that I

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:10%
call it the spiritual
aspect of self or our center

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:10%
or whatever that label
would be for our audience,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and move back before that
thing happened, and we

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:10%
can get in touch with a part
of us that isn't our anger,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:10%
isn't our fear,
isn't the decision.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And if it's done--

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:90%
so a person practices it.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:84%
They can actually
go and, many times,

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
remember when they
made the decision,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:90%
money is going to be a problem.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Health is going to be a problem.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And if they move
back before that,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:84%
it's like the unconscious
mind will just let it go.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you can connect
to when it wasn't an issue?

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you just have to go
back in this timeline therapy.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and there are
wonderful other therapies, too.

00:14:38.825 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that's the--

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's one of them.

00:14:41.185 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's an example.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And the idea is to allow
consciousness to move us

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to a place where we say, I
remember when I wasn't this.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And what it happens is it takes
the emotional charge off of it.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.458 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to-- we're
free to make a new decision.

00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the other
thing you mentioned,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:84%
what you're calling
limiting decisions,

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that's like the programming that
we've accepted that we are this

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.065 align:middle line:84%
or that there isn't
enough or that--

00:15:04.065 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
is that what you're
talking about with those?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
times have we talked

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.127 align:middle line:84%
to our friends who
are in relationships,

00:15:09.127 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and they say my
relationships work

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
great for about six months,
and then after six months,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:90%
they just fall apart?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And they go along and they
get in another relationship

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.358 align:middle line:90%
and it falls apart.

00:15:17.358 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask them, how
do you do relationships,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
they say well they're
fine for about six months,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.037 align:middle line:84%
and they fall apart,
well, that's a decision--

00:15:23.037 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That you've made.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --that we've made
based on my past.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.897 align:middle line:84%
The idea is we'll
go look at my past

00:15:28.897 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:90%
and we've put enough checkmarks.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.522 align:middle line:84%
And when I get enough checkmarks
underneath this thing,

00:15:32.522 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
then that's who I am.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're so busy
being co-dependent,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.763 align:middle line:84%
the product of a dysfunctional
family, you know,

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
be careful of the small
self and the saboteur within

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and the ego that will
separate us from our divine.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.722 align:middle line:84%
We're so busy with all
that stuff we forget

00:15:43.722 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
that we have divine authority.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.775 align:middle line:84%
So we need to remember
we have divine authority.

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.573 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's what the
great scriptures were saying.

00:15:52.573 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And also really listen
to what we're saying,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
if we are doing this negative
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We go to lunch and talk about
how terrible the opposite sex

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
is and how relationships
never work.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we go on
a date that night

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and find out that
they're terrible

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.125 align:middle line:84%
and our relationships
don't work.

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And they go, I wonder why?

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You ask a very
important question.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this in the
material about you.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait to
find your answer.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, who
do you think you are?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer?

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Around the 18th surgery,
I was sent to a psychiatrist

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
in the University of Washington
because I would not buy

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
into-- by then I
had a colostomy.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said I was going to
have it the rest of my life.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They said I was going to
probably be in a wheelchair,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
have severe--

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.927 align:middle line:84%
and I have letters
from my doctors

00:16:36.927 --> 00:16:39.477 align:middle line:84%
to the insurance company
saying, because every time they

00:16:39.477 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
do surgery, the
insurance company says

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:84%
when are you going to
be done, and they'd

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
write letters back saying,
he's never going to be done.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:90%
This is non-curable.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
He's going to have the
colostomy the rest of his life.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
He's going to have significant
permanent disability.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down and he said,
if you will come work with me,

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I can assist you to face the
reality of your colostomy

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:90%
without your anger.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
don't want to learn

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.737 align:middle line:84%
how to face the
reality of having

00:17:00.737 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:90%
a colostomy without anger.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to go
to the bathroom the way

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:90%
I used to go the bathroom.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, who do
you think you are?

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
And through this
discussion about--

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
and I would argue and
try and quote scripture,

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and he would say
look, I know you're--

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
it says here you abuse
your pain meds sometimes.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- and when I went
back, what I realized was

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was my past.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was my infection.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I went to meetings and
talked about my infection.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I had names for it.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I spent all of my time
dealing with my infection.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't spend any time
dealing with my magnificence.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And when he said, who
do you think you are,

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
it was who do you
think you are that you

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:90%
can beat million-to-one odds?

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's that oh!

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I must be that-- if
I'm going to do that,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
if all things are possible,
if I believe they are,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
then I must be that
thing that's sometimes

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:90%
called a spiritual being.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I must be that essence
that isn't my past.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a past, but that
doesn't mean it's me.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's that kind of thing.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm a spiritual being living
in a spiritual universe

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'm governed
by spiritual laws.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.152 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I get
to make up reality.

00:18:10.152 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:90%
So I had all the tools.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.693 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had goals
and affirmations

00:18:12.693 --> 00:18:14.838 align:middle line:84%
and creative visualizations
and imaging and breath

00:18:14.838 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
in through my nose and
out through my mouth

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and raise my kundalini energy.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I ohmed until my lips
almost fell off kind of thing.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:90%
And nothing had happened.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was it was I
was still holding me as limited

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
in my stuff.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.808 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go use these, and
maybe someday a white light

00:18:31.808 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:84%
will shoot through the
window and I'll be healed.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.892 align:middle line:84%
And what I got was, if
you're going to be healed,

00:18:35.892 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to believe
you're going to be healed.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with who
do you think you are?

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.658 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
shift in consciousness.

00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the shift that then
allowed me to use the tools

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been reading for so
long and go and use them with

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
some authority rather
than my fingers crossed.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I could go use imaging
techniques, if you will,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
using my imagination
about my body,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and know that my body would
respond and create itself

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
a different way.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Because I have-- I'm not--

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm hesitating on
the words because I

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
don't want to say this is
the only way to hold that,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
or this is.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think the key
in really applying

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
these techniques starts with
who do you think you are?

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And the answer is really what
you have learned as a spiritual

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
being, like who am I and
what power do I have?

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And what am I going
to choose to be?

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that's where you
as the co-creator come in.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.727 align:middle line:84%
But you did all your
homework before that.

00:19:38.727 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And I applied the principles.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if I
was having a bad day,

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd take my five minutes
and write my affirmations

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.488 align:middle line:84%
if that was the thing I
was using at that time.

00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd take my 10 minutes and
try and imagine health.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.528 align:middle line:84%
I'd take-- I didn't
just sit around

00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:52.987 align:middle line:84%
and say, well I
tried it yesterday.

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work, so I quit.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:90%
How come me?

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.138 align:middle line:90%
Poor me.

00:19:56.138 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, you are writing a book.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have a working title.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you
share that with us?

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The title is,
"The Hell I Can't."

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from the
night of the 10th surgery

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
when these loving,
caring physicians

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
came in and said
we've got x-rays

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to do this thing.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And gently-- I mean,
they really did.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The guy who was my surgeon
was real kind of stoic.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
This was back in
the '60s and '70s,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
before they had some of
the interpersonal skills.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down next to
my bed and took my hand,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and he said son, we don't
know how severe this damage

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:90%
is going to be.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is you
cannot expect to come out

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:90%
of this one whole.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>> So that was--

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And he was trying to
share with his belief.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.745 align:middle line:84%
I've been around a long
time, and I'm telling you

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
some damage out of this.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.425 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know how big it's--
and when I kept thinking about

00:20:45.425 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that, it was just one more
time when my teacher was going

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.088 align:middle line:84%
to tell me don't try
and go into sciences,

00:20:50.088 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:84%
or my coach said
don't be an athlete,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or don't dream too much,
don't risk too much.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
You might lose.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.945 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to be
somebody you're not.

00:20:55.945 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was, you can't
come out of this whole.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And finally from
within me, this--

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
it's like, the hell I can't!

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started
me on the journey.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I just think that is
wonderful because you

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
had to pay such a heavy
price to come so far.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But now as you told me
what we would talk about,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
you said I just want to
share these principles.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share
this good story.

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you're really sharing
some real powerful information

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:90%
to people, Terry McBride.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll bet you that everybody
watching your show has seen

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.680 align:middle line:84%
a one where the
show touches them.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And from within
them, that spark they

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
talk about that's always within
here, that it gets fanned.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And they go I can do it!

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's about, that
we have each other to inspire

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:90%
one another.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, just bless you.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing your
wisdom and your light with us.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Georgia.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That was wonderful.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like to be in
touch with us, or through us

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%

00:22:20.468 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
The question was, who
do you think you are?

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're the one that
has the answer to that.

And I hope you are
answering that you're

a loving, beautiful,
spiritual being that's healthy
