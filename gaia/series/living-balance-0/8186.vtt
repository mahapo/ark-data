00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and I want to welcome
you to Living in Balance.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.785 align:middle line:90%
Our subject today is success.

00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be talking about how

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:90%
we might reinvent success.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
use this definition.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Success is finding the
path to human wholeness.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.992 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:23.436 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Today is Patricia Varley.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And I want to welcome you.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Georgia.

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You are a business
and personal coach.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
But you have a neat title.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:10%
I like this.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:10%
You're called an internal
development specialist.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:10%
Now what are you developing?

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe that
really success comes from--

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I reinvent success
from the inside out.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So I really work with both
groups and individuals

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
on an inner level
to bring more of who

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
they are to what
they do, whether it's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to an organization,
whether or not

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:90%
they own their own business.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It's really bringing
their authentic sense

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of purpose and mission to
their work and their life.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.525 align:middle line:84%
>> And there is a need
for that, apparently.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:19.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>> People are not bringing that
authenticity of who they are

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:10%
into their work.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I'm finding that.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:10%
And I also find that
individuals, whether they're

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:10%
entrepreneurial or work
with a major corporation,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:10%
really want more meaning and
fulfillment in their life.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:10%
And that is one of the reasons
why they're seeking out

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:10%
someone like a coach or wanting
to bring more of their heart

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:10%
to their work, because
something is missing.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's causing
them to look within

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.463 align:middle line:84%
and redefining not
only themselves,

00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
but the way in which they
define success in the work

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's interesting that
we've come to that point

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:10%
as a society or as individuals
where we are really looking

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:10%
for more fulfillment
in our work.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not just OK
to make the money

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:10%
and have that a
place where you go

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:10%
and you do something,
that work environment.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:10%
>> And so we want
to be fulfilled.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:10%
And also we want to have a
feeling of accomplishment.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm finding with the
work that I'm doing out

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:10%
in the world is that
people want to feel

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:10%
that they're contributing.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.278 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone wants
to feel that they matter

00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and that they make a difference.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And very often I've
gone into corporations,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.102 align:middle line:90%
and you can just tell--

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is nothing
against corporations,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but that individuals
somehow feel disconnected

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
from themselves, or
they want to feel

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that they are an important
integral part of the whole.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what I do is
a path to human wholeness

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
through success, and I
use it through coaching

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and through my speaking work.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Now are you finding that some
people are really in the wrong

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
job, or are they looking at
their job in the wrong way?

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
What are we dealing with
here If someone is not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:90%
happy on the job?

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's--
actually I think it's both.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's
a statistic that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.867 align:middle line:84%
would say one or the other,
but I find, for example,

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
with my private clients that a
lot of the people I work with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:90%
are in transition.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And genuinely they have
completed what they've done.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like they can't
get anymore out of it,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's about making
a major life change.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
worked with a woman

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
who was in a major corporation
for many years, about 15 years,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and ended up leaving and
becoming a massage therapist.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
She was like VP of a
computer analyst company

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and just completely
changed her life.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Someone else just needed
to re-perceive their work

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and themselves from
a different light.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think
of an example.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I have someone who is a graphic
artist, for example, who,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:84%
she loves her work, but needed
to maybe branch out and market

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
herself to a different
niche or in a different way

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:90%
so she felt more fulfilled.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So still her same talent,
but just redirecting that.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, from a
different perspective.

00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you have-- one
of the things I liked

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:10%
in your materials is
that you have a maze.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And this maze is kind of
like what we sometimes

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
are doing is we're trying to
find our way through that maze.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
talk about that path--

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.615 align:middle line:90%
>> --to the human wholeness.

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:02.415 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Success is finding the
path to human wholeness.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And it is a maze.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I think we each have our
own individual journey.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's very, very clear.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
For others, there is a lot
of unfolding and evolving

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be done
as they're on the path.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, myself, I started
out wanting to be a therapist

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and ended up in hotel
management for many, many years,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and then resort
management, and then

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
got involved in a network
marketing business where

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I was self-employed.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
very entrepreneurial.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And that led me now to doing
the motivational, inspirational

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
speaking and the business
and personal coaching.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So everything has been a
different turn of that maze,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's led me to my, what I'd
say, my purpose or my mission.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.317 align:middle line:84%
And some of us just know it
right away, and other of us

00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
have stepping stones that
we need to take in order

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to be clear about that.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even in that maze, we go a
certain distance and we realize

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
we have to regroup and go back.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And try again.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.605 align:middle line:84%
>> And I like that, too,
because your background is in--

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:00.605 align:middle line:84%
you have your bachelor's
in behavioral sciences.

00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:01.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Sciences, right.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.138 align:middle line:84%
>> But your master's
was in management?

00:05:03.138 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Organization and
management and human services

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So really what I've
done is integration

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.768 align:middle line:90%
is the key with my work.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I've integrated the
professional, personal,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual aspects
of growth and of life,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
where my behavioral science,
which is psychological,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
sociological approach.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I have the management
and the business master's,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and then the spiritual
foundation that kind of

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
is the web through all of it.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And I like that, because
what you say is we really need

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
to-- what we're talking about
is living in balance in mind,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're saying it's an
integration of professional,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:90%
personal, and spiritual growth.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And spiritual, right.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You need to really
blend all of those.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And we are not a
whole or happy person

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
if one of those aspects of
our life are not working.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And we need to really get
all of it kind of working

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:84%
together and, as you
say, integrating it.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:90%
That's right, Georgia.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I often-- at
times I'll hire--

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- clients
will hire me as a coach.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say,
well, I don't want

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:90%
to do the spiritual counseling.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do the
spiritual coaching.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.598 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm really a
coach and not a counselor.

00:06:02.598 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And I say, OK, OK.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize that
ultimately the spiritual piece

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
is what we end up focusing on
because that's the piece they

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.795 align:middle line:90%
haven't focused on.

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're feeling
disconnected in their work

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.087 align:middle line:84%
is that they're disconnected
from their spirit

00:06:15.087 --> 00:06:17.637 align:middle line:84%
and from their heart and from
what it is that makes them tick

00:06:17.637 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and what their passion is.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And as we unfold and
discover what that is,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
their work becomes
more meaningful.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think so
often as a society,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
we compartmentalize that that
doesn't belong in the same room

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:90%
as our work.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:90%
They're mutually exclusive.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But really what I'm
finding in terms

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
of working with individuals
and associations

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
mutually supportive.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:90%
They help each other.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And I like that.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I like the idea that people
are asking for this approach,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
into corporations

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and they know that you're
going to be looking

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
at the whole picture,
including the spiritual side,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is that OK in American
business culture?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm finding--

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
about six years.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I first started, I
mean, my own-- my left brain,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
my rational mind
thought I was crazy.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It said, you can't go into
companies or associations

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.075 align:middle line:84%
and talk about spirit
in the workplace.

00:07:11.075 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually
finding that I'm

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%
being hired because I do that.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.345 align:middle line:90%
And I think that--

00:07:17.345 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you saw
the cover of "Businessweek"

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%
November 1999.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
The cover of "Businessweek" was
"Spirituality in the Workplace,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Religion in Corporate America."

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
reason that's even

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
on a cover of a
national magazine

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
like that is that the externals
aren't working for people,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're so
changeable in our society

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's forcing
individuals to go within.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And companies are
realizing that they've

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
got to start valuing
the human capital, not

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
just the intellectual
capital, so to speak.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of companies,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
like I worked with
Kraft Foods, and I've

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
done some work with Chase Bank
and Wall Street for women.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And different organizations,
it's because it's spiritual.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a different approach.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It makes people feel like
their individuality matters

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:90%
and makes a difference.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's great
that not all companies,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
but some companies are beginning
to really awaken themselves

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that they
have valuable individuals

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:90%
in the organization.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I liked in an
article that you had written

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
was that you used a
heart-centered approach.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Now if we're doing that, we
will interact differently

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%
with our colleagues.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>> With the people with whom
we work if we're coming from

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:90%
a heart-centered approach.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's quite different.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.809 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.168 align:middle line:84%
Very often with my
private clients,

00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
they want to come from a
heart-centered approach.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And very often there
is a resistance,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
as much as they want it, because
it means being more vulnerable,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.525 align:middle line:90%
and it means being more real.

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And particularly in
the business world,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.775 align:middle line:84%
where often we have our personas
and we go in and do our job--

00:08:53.775 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, yeah.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> --the authenticity, that
realness, the communication,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the connection with someone on
a business level with a customer

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
or a colleague, it actually is
more effective if we are more

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But we're not taught
that that's safe to do.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of what
I hope to instill.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's also
disarming to the other person.

00:09:13.273 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are not used to being

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:90%
approached at that level.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
if when you are

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
used to projecting that
persona, and then you shift

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and you respond to
someone on a human level

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
rather than on a
professional level,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of taken aback.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I have.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.622 align:middle line:90%
I had someone who called me in.

00:09:34.622 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a negative phone
call, and he was talking

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:90%
about something with anger.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, well, that's
an interesting concept.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.533 align:middle line:84%
>> And he kind of giggled
because he expected me to come

00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:47.683 align:middle line:90%
back to him angry.

00:09:47.683 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I
thought about it.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, that's a
way for him to look at this.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:90%
This happy.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But that is kind
of new to business.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of
courage to show up

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace like
that, because we want

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:90%
to protect ourselves somehow.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.527 align:middle line:84%
But it's like what comes
first, the chicken or the egg.

00:10:08.527 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Needing to have the persona
and protect ourselves and go

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
in and do our job is
creating the problem

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
of people feeling disconnected
and companies maybe

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:90%
not working.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we go back internally and
say, what do I need to develop

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and nurture internally so
that my external world,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
my work, my
relationships will be

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
more fulfilling and effective?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, sure.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And that sounds wonderful.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You have a mission
statement or a thought

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:90%
that you've shared here.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I heal myself and the
planet by speaking

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the message of feminine
power in the ecstatic

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:90%
voice of God's love.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my own
personal mission.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to have
their own mission statement.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
You feel that's important
because you have now,

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
in writing, you have
formalized how you think.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The ecstatic voice
of God's love.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>> God's love.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine power,
in terms of healing myself

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and the planet,
when I say feminine,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't necessarily mean female.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean the feminine
principle of heart,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
of intuition, of receiving,
of all the spirit, the passion

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that we need to integrate
into the business world

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.358 align:middle line:84%
so we can have not
just a balanced life

00:11:16.358 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:90%
but a balanced workplace.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And not just for
females, but the feminine--

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The feminine in men
and women, absolutely.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.888 align:middle line:84%
It's the feminine principle
for male or female.

00:11:23.888 --> 00:11:26.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have lots of
ways that we can get there.

00:11:26.097 --> 00:11:27.395 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to take a break.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we'll just

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
go step by step so that you can
reinvent success for yourself.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.056 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned, and
we'll be right back.

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:37.954 align:middle line:90%

00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And our subject is
reinventing success.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an individual
path to that human wholeness.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And success tells
us whether or not

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:90%
we are fulfilling our purpose.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we are just enjoying
that passion of the work

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing and
we sometimes need help,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
Patricia Varley comes in.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
She is a business
and personal coach.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:10%
And I love the other part--
an internal development

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:10%
specialist.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes we do have to
develop ourselves, do we not?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Internally, absolutely.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
a private client,

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.950 align:middle line:84%
very often the outside maybe
isn't working in their business

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
or in their life
because the inside

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
has been either
neglected or needs

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:90%
some support in their growth.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:10%
So what I'll do when
I'll coach somebody

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:10%
is I'll work with them
to really find out

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:10%
what their objectives are.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:10%
So we'll help to clarify
those objectives.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.777 align:middle line:10%
>> And you know,
it's interesting.

00:12:38.777 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:10%
We find always that everything
in the outer part of our life

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:10%
works better if we have really
done our homework inside.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:45.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:45.945 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to go back
and heal the past,

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
do all the forgiveness stuff.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of work
to being a happy person.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There is, and a
successful person,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever you may
define success to be.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.382 align:middle line:84%
So often a client will say, gee,
I want to expand my business.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot
of entrepreneurs.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to expand my business.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So we develop a marketing
strategy for them

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and clarify what their
goals are and objectives.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But then we find out that there
are belief systems or maybe

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
bad habits or fears that they
have from the past that prevent

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
them from actually moving
forward and expanding

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in the way that they would like.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So part of the coaching process,
which is an ongoing process,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is to help an individual have
freedom from limiting beliefs

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:84%
so that they can create a
different type of work or life

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
for themself, if that's
what they choose.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's a fun job,
then, that you've created.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Very fulfilling.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Very, very rewarding.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we have practical steps
that people can take to reclaim

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:90%
the wholeness.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.318 align:middle line:84%
>> So reclaiming the
wholeness of people.

00:13:43.318 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
We start with number one.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You say it's clarification
of objective.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.955 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's
where you ask them,

00:13:48.955 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:90%
what do you really want to do?

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And they write it down.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:90%
They tell you.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.018 align:middle line:84%
Do they have to think
about it, or what's

00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:90%
the formulation of that?

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>> A question I ask everyone
is, in a perfect ideal world,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
without worrying about
money or details,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.360 align:middle line:90%
what would you do in your heart?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:90%
What inspires you?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.232 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you could do anything?

00:14:06.232 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people are not doing it,
or they're doing a part of it.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to
get in touch with what

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that
inspires them the most,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
spirit informs their desire.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.582 align:middle line:84%
And that is a guideline for me
to where I can start working.

00:14:20.582 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now if they have blocks to
really knowing what they want

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to do, how do you help
them remove those blocks?

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.357 align:middle line:84%
If they can't bring
clarity to it.

00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Often what I'll do is I
will have them sometimes make

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:90%
a list.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Write down everything
that you're good at.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.825 align:middle line:84%
Write down everything
that you like.

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:35.575 align:middle line:84%
Write down the things
that you don't like,

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
the things that you feel
you need improvement in.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a
look at those lists.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Very often, I talk about
reinventing success.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.857 align:middle line:84%
But so often it's individuals
want to reinvent the wheel,

00:14:44.857 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and what they're really looking
for is right in front of them.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is help
them to uncover the areas

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.548 align:middle line:84%
where their strengths and
their unique gifts are.

00:14:53.548 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Your second point-- and this
is important because of that.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
It's release of the past.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The past is freedom
from limiting beliefs.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we are our own
worst enemy in that case--

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.865 align:middle line:84%
>> --if we are blocking
ourselves to success.

00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it could be just even
things from childhood

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:90%
or previous experiences.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:90%
So how do we free ourselves?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll give you an example.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I have a client up
in the Northeast,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
because I work
nationally, who we

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:84%
did a marketing strategy to
help her expand her business.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But when it came down to
really getting on the phone

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and calling up people
to set up appointments,

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.027 align:middle line:84%
she would completely
froze with fear

00:15:30.027 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because she had this
belief that said, well,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
who was she to get out
there with her business?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
She was afraid to really expand
because she didn't think--

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:84%
she had a belief that
said from her family,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:90%
you're not that big.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not that important.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.062 align:middle line:84%
Not from an ego place, but
who are you to do that?

00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So there was this tape
running in her head that

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
was preventing her from
actually expanding her business

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:90%
at the level that she wanted.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So once we identified
that, because awareness

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is half the battle,
we were able to make

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.293 align:middle line:90%
some steps to move forward.

00:15:58.293 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And even, I noticed in one of
the other articles that you had

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
written, you mentioned
using the terminology,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.905 align:middle line:84%
the shift in words from
selling to sharing.

00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:06.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:06.705 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And that word sharing
is much more comfortable.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.288 align:middle line:84%
Well, selling,
very often, if you

00:16:13.288 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
think of someone who tries
to sell you something,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you think about they're
really thinking about what

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:90%
they want to get from you.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
of sharing, it's

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'm here to share
my gifts with you.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to share my work
with you, my talents.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need to
get anything from you.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of sharing.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a contribution mode.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Very often that sort of
hard-core sales pitch

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:90%
is about survival.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I need
you to make my quota.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.567 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of a
survival consciousness.

00:16:38.567 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not comfortable.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And most of us will
shy away from that.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And even presenting that to
someone doesn't feel good.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you really believe in
yourself and what you're doing,

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.113 align:middle line:90%
there is a level of sharing.

00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know you're
making a difference.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.895 align:middle line:84%
It's an easier exchange
between two people,

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
professional world.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, the third step
that you can take

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:10%
is development of the practical
tools to achieve results.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:10%
So there's a practical aspect.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:10%
You come into this not with
this airy-fairy feeling good

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.865 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh no.

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:10%
>> But that's where the
practical businesswoman comes

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:10%
in here too.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I work on two
levels with process,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
which is a lot of what
we've been talking about,

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and then there's task.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And the tools are,
OK, what do we

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
need to do this week on a real
practical specific tangible

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.565 align:middle line:90%
level for you to--

00:17:24.565 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
bottom line, let's say you
want to increase your business

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
by 25%, or you
want to ultimately

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.315 align:middle line:84%
maybe expand into
the state of Georgia,

00:17:32.315 --> 00:17:33.273 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:17:33.273 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You want to work
more nationally.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.890 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to do?

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.432 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to market yourself?

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I help a lot of people
with their marketing tools.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And by defining
who they are, they

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
can have more effective
marketing tools

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:90%
to get out there.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:90%
We might do mailings.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The tools are
different depending

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:90%
on the client that I work with.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, also you
said with that,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
all your materials that you send
out there should really reflect

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
who you are.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So you bring
that into it, too.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.745 align:middle line:84%
And everything that you
have should reflect that.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Most often when I work--

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Your business card
and paperwork, all that.

00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Very often, when I work with
a client, part of the tools

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is getting the physical
marketing tools.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And very often they have
to change because they've

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
been on a different
professional path,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
or they need to shift it
to who they really are.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
So very often, that will change.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It will start networking
in different groups.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things
I really feel is important

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is that it's important to
collaborate and cooperate

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:90%
with like-minded professionals.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
That actually is a tool, to
get out there and start meeting

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.018 align:middle line:84%
with like-minded professionals,
to share your talents,

00:18:35.018 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to share what your
services or your product

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.727 align:middle line:90%
are with other people.

00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Networking is what
they're calling it,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:10%
and that's really
basically what it is.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Now also, another point
that you say here is a shift

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:10%
in perspective and
heightened awareness.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now what is that,
a shift in perspective?

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a shift in perspective
is if you've seen yourself in A

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
or B and there's actually D and
E that would better support you

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in your work, very often, if
we've got our blinders on like

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
this for a long time, we
need to step out of that.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And what a coach
does enables you to--

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
it's an objective
outside person that

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
can enable you to
step out of yourself

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and look at your business
from a different perspective

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.392 align:middle line:84%
and maybe see what you
couldn't see before.

00:19:14.392 --> 00:19:16.058 align:middle line:84%
>> And with the
heightened awarenesses--

00:19:16.058 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
and really be paying attention.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, OK, open the eyes.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We get in a groove,
the day-to-day groove.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're not even
aware of what it

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is that we're doing until we
start to get uncomfortable

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:90%
very often.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
the coach comes in,

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:10%
where I come in and really
help an individual develop

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:10%
that awareness, which then
shifts the perspective

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:10%
perception, which then we
can apply the tools to,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.865 align:middle line:10%
and that's where they
can move forward.

00:19:37.865 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And then finally--

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and this is where you have that
philosophy of yours drawing it

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
all together, an integrated
holistic approach to life.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And not departmentalizing
everything.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I talked earlier

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
about the integration of
the professional, personal,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual aspects of life.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And then I asked you,
how would you approach me

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:10%
individually differently if you
were going to be my personal

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:10%
business coach, or if you
were looking at me as part

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:10%
of a network in a
big corporation?

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:10%
How would you handle the
individual differently

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.937 align:middle line:10%
than a person that's apart?

00:20:10.937 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, there's
different factors to take

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:10%
into consideration.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:10%
If you're a self-employed
individual like yourself,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:10%
you're going to have
different variables

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:10%
that I would need to look at.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And you have actually a lot
more freedom in certain ways

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:10%
if you work for yourself.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So not to say that there
couldn't be creativity

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
in a corporation, but if
someone's just an entrepreneur,

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.235 align:middle line:84%
there is more of a space
in which to say, oh,

00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to create
this, or I'm going to try this,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
or I think I'm
going to take some--

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
some people need time
off just to get balanced

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:90%
and to kind of regroup.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a business
or a corporation,

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.457 align:middle line:90%
there's a company mission.

00:20:45.457 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Very often people have
a boss unless they're

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
the executive themselves.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.507 align:middle line:90%
So there are other guidelines--

00:20:50.507 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say that are
restrictive, but as a coach

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I would need to
identify what those

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:90%
are before we can move forward.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>> And even to make sure that
my personal mission statement

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:10%
could really connect with
the mission statement

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:10%
of the corporation.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:10%
That's where--

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>> --you might be able to
see if there are some issues.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of questions.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, with
every client that I

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.198 align:middle line:84%
work with, whether they're in
a corporation or individuals,

00:21:11.198 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I have them create
a personal mission

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
statement and a professional
mission statement

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:84%
or look at the mission statement
from the company and say,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:84%
are these completely
separate, or are there

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:90%
some common threads?

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:90%
How can they work together?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the tools
that I use to work with them.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a good guideline.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.965 align:middle line:84%
>> So then you can see, do
you fit in this corporation?

00:21:28.965 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, absolutely.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Will this work for you?

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what happens.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I like this approach.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:10%
And I understand the integration
of the professional, personal,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and spirit, because then we're
looking at the whole person,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:10%
the holistic approach.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:10%
So I thank you.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:10%
I think you're serving as well.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying my work, and
it's very nice to be here.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you would like to
be in touch with Patricia--

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.542 align:middle line:84%
and we always love to
hear from you-- stay

00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:90%
tuned we'll let you know how.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.402 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have
some parting thoughts.

00:22:30.553 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
To really live in balance
in mind, body, and spirit,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at ourselves in
every compartment of our life

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and not separate them.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.010 align:middle line:90%
We are the businessperson.

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.010 align:middle line:90%
We are the professional.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:90%
We are the personal.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have all of our spiritual
aspects to deal with too.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think if we
can integrate those,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.607 align:middle line:84%
I love the heart-centered
approach to dealing with that.

00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

happy, and peaceful,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:90%
