00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA SHAKTI-HILL: Hello,
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I am so delighted to welcome
you to "Living In Balance."

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.710 align:middle line:84%
We are going to have a lovely
woman from the east, who

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
has brought the wisdom of
Chinese, all from zen touch

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%
to tai chi to qi gong.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.750 align:middle line:90%
We'll speak of feng shui.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And we will even
trace our meridians.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So do come join us on
"The Rhythms of the Tao."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
As I said, we have
a lovely guest

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.988 align:middle line:90%
with us today, Lydia Wong.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so pleased to have you.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA WONG: Thank you so much.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: I enjoyed
your work so much.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You have tapes and
CD's and just videos.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:90%
You have a book.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.508 align:middle line:84%
And we're calling this
"The Rhythms of the Tao"

00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
because that's the name
of your book and your CD.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.467 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.993 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: You come from
Singapore by way of London.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And you
have a story that

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
has brought you to
this marvelous way

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that you're sharing with us.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And you have put everything
together so that you can really

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
explain to us what
is this, the Taoism

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese philosophy and
how it works with our bodies.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Well, I was
born in the east.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:10%
So when I came to live in
London, change of diet,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:10%
change of weather,
I became very sick.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:10%
And I had to go back to my roots
to find ways of healing myself.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I read about
the Tao and the rhythms

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Tao, which
is spontaneity,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
wu wei, which is effortless
action or non-action,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and natural simplicity,
it just touched my heart.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to bring a lot
of different healing methods

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:90%
from the east and west.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So it was after you
were in London that you had

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:90%
to go to your roots--

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: --and understand.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: That's right because
I wanted to be very Western

00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.355 align:middle line:84%
and do the aerobic
and go to the gym.

00:01:58.355 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well, what
I like about this

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is it's as if you have really
connected with who you are.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to
share that with us.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And you start-- your tape
starts with an understanding

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:90%
of what is the Tao.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: The Tao is
just very simplistically

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
following the way of nature,
following the way of harmony.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's
harmony is different.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go back to
my roots to find out

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.370 align:middle line:90%
what my harmony was.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And
what I find with--

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
what I had been explained that
the Tao is like your path.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.613 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like your own flow.

00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If you saw the
calligraphy of the Tao,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a chief's head
with feathers in his head.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And he looked as if he was
sitting on a boat traveling

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.594 align:middle line:90%
Taon the river.

00:02:45.594 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and then you
talk right away about chi

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
because chi is very important
to the whole concept

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:90%
of the Eastern philosophy.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Right, so chi
is like a flow of energy.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies has
pathways called meridians.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're like rivers
where the chi flows.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is where our energy
transportation goes through.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So when we get stressed
or if we eat unhealthily,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:90%
the chi gets blocked.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.573 align:middle line:84%
And we need to find ways
to open this flow again.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well,
one of my friends

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
was just recently
diagnosed with arthritis.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just was worrying about
her and thinking about it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I just got so clear.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:90%
I just told her--

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I said, your chi is blocked.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.625 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And it was just
like, we both know this.

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if there was--
and she does Tai Chi.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But she hadn't been doing
it now for a few years.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And so she had really
not been balancing

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
as far as her exercise
and her approach to life.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You know how we do that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.432 align:middle line:84%
And our body pays because
the chi has to flow.

00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: There's two ways
of improving our chi.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And one is through breathing.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
is through food.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can pick and
choose which way to go.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Now, this is not--

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
this is somewhat new
to Western philosophy.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's become very in.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
People want to
know more about it.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept
of chi and the Tao

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
goes back many, many centuries.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Oh,
probably 6,000 years.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, yes,
OK, so it's not new.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
But the whole concept
of Chinese medicine

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:90%
is based on that flow of chi.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You can do it also through
herbs and acupuncture.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.712 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
modalities available.

00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well, I love
the way that you do it.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Thank you.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: One of the things
that I liked is also you have--

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
you do a massage
that is called Zen--

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Touch.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: --touch, OK.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that that
sounded so intriguing.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have our beautiful
Christina Phelps Bowman

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
has once again
volunteered to allow

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
you to do massage with her.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was a lot
of it reminded me of yoga.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's with a partner.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.948 align:middle line:84%
So if we can see that tape,
I'd like to have us watch.

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain to
us what you're doing

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and what zen touch is about.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: OK, I've-- what I've
done is I've incorporated

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
shiatsu, Thai massage,
and healing touch.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So that everybody
is able to do this.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be a therapist.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.415 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
call it zen touch

00:05:23.415 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
is because you're
working from your center.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're not thinking
about doing it perfect.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
You're just listening
to your breathing

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with the person
that you're working with.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice,
all the work comes

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
from the center of your body.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:90%
So I'm quite little.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I can work with
very large people.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: And you have.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know that--

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I think it was --

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Now, this
one is very, very,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.522 align:middle line:84%
very-- it opens the
sides of the body.

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
size of the bodies

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
is where you get the
gallbladder meridian.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So actually,
you're adding a pressure to--

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:90%
what she could do--

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
you're pushing beyond that?

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes, I'm--

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And you're
pushing her body beyond it.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.508 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: --lifting her
elbows up and slightly back.

00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And you're
creating space.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need to do--

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Creating space.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.462 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: --in order
to let that chi flow.

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Right, we're
moving the clutter.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: You're twisting.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: That's right,
twisting very gently.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.885 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Removing the clutter.

00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: This is like
feng shui for the body.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.677 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, it is.

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:27.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: All the exercises that
I teach, that's how I apply it.

00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like feng
shui for the body.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes,
now, there's another

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:90%
that you want to do here.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And this is always so important.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it's
shiatsu and it's yoga.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's touch.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.183 align:middle line:84%
But this is where one can't
press beyond a certain point

00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:43.475 align:middle line:90%
if you're doing it by yourself.

00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.172 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But if you're
doing it with a partner.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: You have to listen
with your fingertips almost.

00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's
your stretching--

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:84%
if you overstretch, you
could hurt the person.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So you have to just be
very still in order to tap

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
into where they're coming from.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.727 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well,
in your book, you

00:07:00.727 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
said that much of what your
therapy is is intuitive.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And so you are listening to--

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.495 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Because
everyone is different.

00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:07.412 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: --her body.

00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And the
limitations are different.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: And so here--

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And the body speaks
to you because if she cannot

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:90%
stretch anymore, it would--

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
you would feel this stop.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, so that-- and
what-- and there are many other

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
exercises that you do
with that, or techniques.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But I ask you to do
some for us that you

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:90%
couldn't do by yourself.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, so this is
a full body treatment.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But I
also ask you if you

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
would show us some of the
things we could do by ourselves.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, you said we're
even going to play

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:90%
with our feet a little bit.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Because
we do have to take

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
care of all parts of
our body, don't we?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: OK.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: So let's work on
the meridians in the hands.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And what you could do is
to rub your hands together.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:90%
We mustn't forget that.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Shake it off.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can start by
just knocking very gently

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the shoulders
and then flip the hands over

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and knock down.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice to--

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: And what does--

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: --energize.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: That gets
the circulation going.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so we're
just tapping lightly.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.237 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Very lightly tapping
all the way down.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And whatever
we do to one side,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.892 align:middle line:84%
we always have to do to
the other side, don't we?

00:08:08.892 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.818 align:middle line:90%
OK, so--

00:08:10.818 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: I know there are
certain rules in all of it.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.992 align:middle line:84%
And then after this, you
can just very lightly pluck.

00:08:18.992 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:90%
This is very delicious.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So that's
another technique.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And then you finish by
just massaging off the fingers.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And this breaks
up the stagnation.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:90%
Then we do the other side.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, like in
the 14 meridians,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
if you knew there was a blockage
in let's say your lungs,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.445 align:middle line:84%
you would start here
using all four fingers

00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:90%
and really penetrate deeply.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so--

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And then
follow down the line

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:90%
all the way off the thumb.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.595 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well, that's
why I liked your tape

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:90%
on energizing your meridians.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us where
our meridians are.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And I've heard about meridians.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I've
seen the drawings.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But until such time
as you actually

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
see it and start lining
them out on your own body,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:90%
you don't really get it.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.947 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:10%
So once you've done
that, it gets very hot.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.815 align:middle line:90%
You can just massage.

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: That
was the long one.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you had a
problem with the lungs,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
then that's what you
would want to do.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a deep massage.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.753 align:middle line:10%
>>LYDIA: Right, so if you had
a large intestine problem,

00:09:17.753 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:10%
you would start from
the index finger

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:10%
and then work yourself
up because that's

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.203 align:middle line:10%
the flow of the large intestine.

00:09:23.203 --> 00:09:25.203 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And we're just
pressing a little bit.

00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
along a certain line.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes, it's quite deep.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Oh, OK.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah--

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.982 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: It's quite deep.

00:09:28.982 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: That does
remind me of shiatsu.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LYDIA: Yes, so--

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.887 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so
you're pushing.

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
You're really getting into that.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Uh-huh, pushing.

00:09:36.262 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can use a cushion to
rest your arm if you get tired.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:10%
And the large intestine
would end at the side

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.265 align:middle line:10%
the corner of the
nose right here.

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGIA: Right there, OK.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>>LYDIA: And you
press it quite deeply.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:10%
It's very painful.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: OK, it should hurt.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And for stomach,
you could start right here.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
There's an indentation.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can lightly tap it.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
work your way down.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.715 align:middle line:84%
This is also very
good for wrinkles.

00:10:03.715 --> 00:10:04.715 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Oh OK.

00:10:04.715 --> 00:10:06.215 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And you
go around the face.

00:10:06.215 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Right here you can just
press all the way down,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.853 align:middle line:90%
skip the eyes.

00:10:13.853 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And
that's the stomach.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And just come
back down here and just

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:90%
work around the collarbone.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
stomach meridian goes down

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
into the belly button and out.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And follow the
outside of your legs.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So here you can
continue pressing.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Pressing again, OK.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Again, you have to
use quite a firm pressure.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: OK, real hard.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's it.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you follow the
outside of your shins.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.183 align:middle line:84%
And you go all the way
down to your second toes.

00:10:44.183 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and now
we have just one minute

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:90%
until we go to break.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: The feet--

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So what can
we do with our feet?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: This is very grounding.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you
stretch your thumbs

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.806 align:middle line:84%
And then you come to the
middle and you pinch it.

00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Oh OK--

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: You do it
like three times.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And it helps to root
you into the Earth.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so
you push apart.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.092 align:middle line:90%
And then you pinch.

00:11:06.092 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And this
is also very good

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.957 align:middle line:90%
to break up congestion for pain.

00:11:09.957 --> 00:11:11.832 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and the
other foot in the end.

00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:13.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: And the other foot, OK.

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So this
is good for us.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Stretch and pinch.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.598 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so we
stretch and then we pinch.

00:11:17.598 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's grounding,
and it's good for pain.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yeah, so let's say
if you had a wrist stagnation,

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.827 align:middle line:84%
you would stretch it,
stretch it, and pinch.

00:11:25.827 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Stretch,
stretch, pinch.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, we still have to talk about
feng shui, tai chi, meridians.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to play.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay
tune, we'll be right back

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
with more of "The
Rhythms of the Tao."

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm George Shakti-Hill.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today
is Lydia Wang.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking about
"The Rhythms of the Tao."

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's become very
popular in the United States

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:90%
is feng shui.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.555 align:middle line:90%
Feng shui--

00:11:58.555 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, feng
shui and Mandarin.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
In Cantonese, it's feng shui.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So the sound is always different
in a different dialect.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes,
now with feng shui,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that is actually the placement
of furniture in your home

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.350 align:middle line:84%
in order to allow
the flow of chi.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, it's
also to do with colors.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It's also to do with
the Earth's energy.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps, before you
started clearing your house,

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to check to see
the Earth's energies positive.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, and you
are a feng shui consultant.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And you have credentials.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: You
have studied well.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, that is part of the whole
package of the philosophy

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:10%
that you work with.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, well, I found
that when I was helping people

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
with their bodies, they
would keep coming back

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:90%
with the same problems.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was until I
stepped into their home

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.155 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that oh, the
houses need to be cleared too.

00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, and
you said before you

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.865 align:middle line:84%
can have the remedies,
you have to clear.

00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: I think it's
a good idea to, but--

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, so we have
much that we're going to do.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that you and
I are going to do together

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to work
with the meridians.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And tell me about what
we're going to be doing.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: OK, the--
we're going to start

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:84%
with tracing the yin
and the yang meridian,

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
central meridian.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And the back is called
the governing meridian.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.848 align:middle line:84%
And that helps you to
prevent energy leakage

00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes when
we get very drained,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
it's because the central
meridian is unzipped.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it as a
zipper, it gets unzipped.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So we're actually
going to trace meridians.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
try to follow you.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And I've watched your tape.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And the tape is on
energizing your meridians.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So this would be very good for
people to know their meridians

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and to do this little exercise.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Absolutely.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And it's
just a couple minutes.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Once they
learn the whole routine,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%
it takes two minutes.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so we're going to
go to this two minute meridian,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:90%
balancing and tracing.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and you
can tell us about it.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So we started with what
is the central meridian.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.848 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we start with the--

00:13:56.848 --> 00:13:59.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: We always start
with shaking our hands.

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
central meridian.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Then we go to the back, which
is the governing meridian.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to
start with the spleen.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So spleen is at the
outside of your big toes.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And you trace inside the
legs up to the armpits

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and down to the waist.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is for digestion,
helping with metabolism.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hot meridian and
the small intestine meridian.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So there is
a line of flow for--

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: --each of the organ.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Here comes the bladder.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:90%
It's very long.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way down the
spine and off the little toes.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And kidney meridian
runs underneath and up

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.555 align:middle line:90%
to the collarbone.

00:14:38.555 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And that's a
very important place that--

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Here comes
circulation sex.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important for stress.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:90%
This is triple warmer.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, you go around the ears
and off the ring finger.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
And that helps you to relax.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.486 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to sleep.

00:14:56.486 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to control stress.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the gallbladder
meridian, which is even longer.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And it goes all the way
around the sides of your body.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.492 align:middle line:84%
And it comes off
the fourth toes.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And
those are the paths,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:90%
the pathways of the meridian.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And then liver comes
up like the spleen,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but it only ends
underneath the breast.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And here comes the lungs
and large intestine.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.767 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And as I
told you, I watched this

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
and I just loved your tape.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And this is
the stomach meridian.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: It was the
first time I really knew

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:90%
where my own meridians were.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: It's a great
way to unblock your chi.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: --to learn,
yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.867 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And when you
go to the acupuncturist,

00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:41.242 align:middle line:84%
that's what they're
working with.

00:15:41.242 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Sure.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
having a difficulty

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
with some part of the
body-- oh, and here we are.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
The central again.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:90%
We're zipping up.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: We always finish
up with zipping up,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.656 align:middle line:90%
front and back.

00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So that's
what we would want to--

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.512 align:middle line:84%
if we do that, we really
are taking care of our body.

00:15:55.512 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It's part of-- it could be
part of our daily routine.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And you think it should be?

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Oh, absolutely,
because you're

00:16:00.755 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:90%
uncluttering the meridians.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's like feng shui.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.273 align:middle line:84%
Unclutter the meridians
by tracing it.

00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:07.232 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And actually
you said you don't even

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
have to touch it within
two inches of the body.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.157 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:16:10.157 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Two, three inches.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:10%
So if you're doing a
person that's sick perhaps,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:10%
and having some problems
with pain and discomfort,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:10%
you can just go off the
body and trace exactly.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And always remember
to shake off.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, OK.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Shake off--

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Shake off.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGIA: --the energies.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We also did some tai chi,
just a wee bit of that.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yeah, just a wee bit.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.583 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Now, tai chi--

00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:90%
there are different schools.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:90%
There are different styles.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And you do one that's
really just beautiful.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And you combine
tai chi and qi gong

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:84%
as part of your
whole package, too,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.773 align:middle line:84%
that you're training people in
what you call the chinetics.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
one of your tapes.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we do
all these things together.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: It's a lot easier
to learn than tai chi chuan.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a series
of solo exercises

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.607 align:middle line:90%
that you string together.

00:16:56.607 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: So we did that.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a look at
that, too, just to see.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell us a little
bit about what we are doing,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:90%
shaking off that chi, OK.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: OK, here we
are, opening to the sky.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful one to
begin and embracing tiger.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
This is what it's
called, embracing tiger.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Return to mountain.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
So this exercise is
called embrace tiger,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:90%
return to mountain.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I love to do
this as the beginning

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
because it opens to the sky.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And it embraces the Earth.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you settle the energy
down before you begin.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Now here we are
holding the chi ball

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and just parting
wild horses mane.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.893 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's called.

00:17:41.893 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Each movement
has a beautiful name.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Parting
wild horses mane.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.128 align:middle line:90%
You've done this before.

00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: I have done tai chi.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't do it every day.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:90%
And I want to.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to be good.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And here comes
the cloud hands, [CHINESE]..

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But I loved
your style because it is--

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:90%
it's lovely.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
It's gentle.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.682 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it's easier
than the strict tai chi chuan.

00:18:04.682 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And if you
just have 10 minutes,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
it's just beautiful to just
pick one or two solo exercises

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.702 align:middle line:90%
and just concentrate on it.

00:18:10.702 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: This is our waves.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: And this is the
waves, flowing with the waves.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:90%
It feels like waves.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, and now
what are the benefits

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
then of the tai chi, these
movements we are doing?

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: It helps you
to calm and slow down.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:90%
And it lengthens your breathing.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to just distress.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And so often
that, as we have found,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
is the basis for disease?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And so that
is a wonderful technique

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:90%
of relieving stress.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: I just
love it because it's

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.688 align:middle line:84%
like bringing some rituals
into your everyday life.

00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And ritual
is good because there

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.147 align:middle line:84%
is a certain power to ritual too
because of the people that have

00:18:51.147 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
been doing it forever and ever.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.318 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, on "The
Rhythms of the Tao,"

00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
you said there are
really like three parts.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And you started
with spontaneity.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Tzu ran,
spontaneity, wu wei,

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
which is like non-action,
which is hard for us

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world to do.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's pusu, which
is natural simplicity.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can bring
these three rhythms

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
into your everyday life,
whether it's cooking, cleaning,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:90%
looking after the children.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Do it
with spontaneity--

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: --with effortless
action and with simplicity.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And that's
a philosophy, then.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: It is.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now, then, back
to your personal story,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.732 align:middle line:84%
you were able then
to heal yourself

00:19:32.732 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
as a result of going back to
what was part of your culture.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right, yes.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And now you
have put this all together.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:10%
And you teach other
people how to do this.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, I'd
love to empower people

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
same amount of healing

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that I did because
I was on medication

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it just made me
a little off balance.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I put on a lot of weight.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was just miserable.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And now you do
this in Key West, Florida.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, I live
in Key West, Florida.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So you have chosen
a lovely place on the planet,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:90%
have you not?

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Yes, I have.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have retreats
available in July for people

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well,
and with the music,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
you said, for example,
your one CD, it is drum.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Yes, drums,
just all drums.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It's used for--

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: And what is this?

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: --feng
shui space clearing.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So you would put
it on really loud.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And it would help to just stir
up the energy and cleanse it.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you would put
on the clear cloud,

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
which would just harmonize and
balance and soothe the energy.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So you then have
incorporated all of this,

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
the massage and the
therapeutic self massage,

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and the stretching.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So the work that you have done
with the body is, you said,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.973 align:middle line:84%
breath and food are
what will build Chi.

00:20:50.973 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and so with
that chi, as we build our chi,

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
then that's how our
immune system is improved.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And what are some
of the benefits?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: Oh, I love the idea
of rejuvenation and anti-aging

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.087 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Anti-aging.

00:21:05.087 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Anti-aging.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: That is in also.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, so the
philosophy's then have really

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:90%
worked to really flow together.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
What I liked about your work is
that this is Lydia's approach.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: This might
not be for everybody.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.955 align:middle line:84%
But if I can just help a small
percentage it would be good.

00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But you've put
your own personal touch--

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: That's right.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: --onto it.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.082 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:21:28.082 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think you have
served us very well.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:90%
The tapes are excellent.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I worked with them.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy them.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.394 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a lot
about my meridians.

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.194 align:middle line:90%
>>LYDIA: Oh, good.

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Which I
knew they were there.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But I just had never
traced them before.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.937 align:middle line:84%
>>LYDIA: It's taken me
five years to learn it.

00:21:41.937 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
video now to learn.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Thank you, OK.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you would like to
be in touch with Lydia,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.652 align:middle line:84%
and we always love to hear
from you, too, stay tuned.

00:21:50.652 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:90%
We'll let you know how.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have
some parting thoughts.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It is so wonderful
to have the wisdom

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
from the east brought to us.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And in so many
different ways, it

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
can impact our
lives so positively.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I love incorporating feng
shui, tai chi, qi gong, and now

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
zen touch also.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at this, we
see that there are many ways

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn to live
in balance in mind, body,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
What we want to know
is what works for us.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:90%
What do we really attune to?

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely and thoroughly
enjoyed all of the activities

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:90%
that we did with Lydia Wong.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank Christina
Phelps Bowman once again.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for being with us.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:90%
