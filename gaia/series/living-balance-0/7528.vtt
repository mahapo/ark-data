00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to welcome you
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.580 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
take a journey home.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We are going to come
back to ourselves.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
we have to really find out

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:84%
how we can take care of
ourselves-- self-care,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:90%
soul care.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.318 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:23.811 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Of all the roles that we play,
sometimes the most difficult

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:90%
one is just being ourselves.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we do have lots of roles
that we are playing out there

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Some are challenging.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Many are stressful.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to know who
we are and what our center is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
care for ourselves.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
can help us with that.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And we do have with
us today Holly Bruno.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.508 align:middle line:90%
And that is her mission.

00:01:01.508 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
So I want to welcome you.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Georgia.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You have an incredibly
diverse background from this.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] As we had
said in your bio,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:90%
you are a recovering attorney.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, had been an assistant
state's attorney general

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:90%
for the state of Maine.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> A law professor, and now
you are on your soul's journey.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm glad that you referred
to me as a recovering attorney,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
because part of
being an attorney

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.835 align:middle line:10%
was living a life
that-- well, first off I

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:10%
would have to apologize
for being an attorney

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:10%
because of the
reputation we have.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, I became an
attorney as many people become

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.350 align:middle line:84%
accountants or they
become doctors or they

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
become teachers, because someone
else wanted them to do that.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I set about
becoming an attorney

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:84%
because it was a challenge
that women were not allowed

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.882 align:middle line:90%
to take on at that point.

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%
This was in 1973.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And I did it for
years and years.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was never at
home within myself.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I always felt as if
I'm working so hard,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
but I don't really feel happy.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it didn't
bring out your best.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't really the true you.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.862 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, what it brought
out was my fierce ego.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I would get in there and
be a zealous advocate.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't ever feel like
I was at peace inside myself.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I felt as if I were
running away from myself.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what it took, Georgia,
was when I turned 40,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing all
of these things,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was just nonstop,
working 14-hour days

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and raising two
children and trying

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
to do everything perfectly, I
got a lump in my left breast.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And at that point,
I really felt that I

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:10%
was having someone
spiritually shaking me

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:10%
by the shoulder saying,
whose life is this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:10%
that you want to lead?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of my journey home.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know we have found
over and over that people talk

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
with us about, it is
often a health issue,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
a very serious health
issue, that totally gets

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
your attention because
it's very humbling.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to have priority, and
so it is life changing often.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lesson that
you then did receive.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
That was the gift.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.835 align:middle line:10%
And you know what I'm hoping for
now, in fact, I'm praying for,

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:10%
is that I don't have to
go through that again

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:10%
to keep learning.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, please, let
me have this lesson.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah, OK.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In fact, now I'm much more
open to what that inner voice

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:10%
is talking about so that when
there's something that I'm not

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:10%
facing, there's something that
I'm resisting, in other words,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:10%
when I'm running away
from my own home,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:10%
that I can sit with
myself and say--

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.253 align:middle line:10%
and I call myself
things like sweetie.

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, sweetie, what is it that you
really don't want to face here?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
difficult for you?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And to stay with that instead
of running away from that.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, I
learned in my family,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned in law school,
I learned to basically

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
be running and keeping busy and
working and being a work addict

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And you know what's fascinating.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Work addiction is approved
of in our society.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> People say, oh, it's
wonderful that you work 14-hour

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Isn't she a saint?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
However if I were a
drug addict, people

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:90%
would say, oh, you poor thing.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But they're both addictions,
and addictions take us away

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:90%
from home.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I read about you
and this idea that so many of us

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
work, work, work, I thought, I
have to talk with this woman.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people that I
know that are successful women,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
it's so hard not to continue
that battle all the time,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:90%
the work ethic.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard to
slow down, to stop.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're bringing a message
to us how we can do that?

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm in fact asking first,
Georgia, what is it

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:90%
that I'm running away from?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that I'm
afraid to stop?

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say
that what happened

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
for me was I discovered
I was running away

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
from feeling that I wasn't
really worthwhile unless I made

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:84%
a certain number
of accomplishments.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I was stacking my
accomplishments

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:90%
like buckwheat pancakes.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you know
what happened when

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I decided no longer to
be a practicing attorney

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and I took some time off.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to a party or I'd
meet people and they'd say,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
and what is it that you do?

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would suffer
because I didn't have

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:90%
that string of fancy titles--

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That label.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --after my name.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the role.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I would say
something like, well,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.433 align:middle line:84%
I'm really finding out
what I'm meant to be doing.

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And then people would
walk away as if--

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
but you know what?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm very
comfortable just being

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
fulfilling my mission, which

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is to help everyone, myself
first, find the way back home.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And that means not
running to work all the time.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.623 align:middle line:84%
Because when I did that,
I was running away.

00:05:18.623 --> 00:05:20.222 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do
have to slow down.

00:05:20.222 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, it
may not be a lesson

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that we can get
right the first time.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to learn
it over and over.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You have a series
of recommendations

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.382 align:middle line:90%
that you have made.

00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go through those

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
because I think these are
excellent lessons for people.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think our first
one is just say no.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
fascinating because I

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
think that came out of Nancy
Reagan's Just Say No to Drugs.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.187 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, those of
us, particularly women,

00:05:45.187 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
who feel like we
need to be everything

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to everybody all the time have
lost the skill of saying no.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And we've been told and
taught that it's a negative

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
to set up a boundary.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:10%
But if I don't have a boundary,
I don't have an identity.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of just saying
no, when someone says to me,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.338 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm sure you can handle
this, part of me wants to say,

00:06:04.338 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
oh, yes, I'll take
on one more thing.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But now at age 53,
I'm saying, thank you

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
for having the confidence
in me, and I'm not

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.552 align:middle line:90%
going to do that right now.

00:06:12.552 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say
set our boundaries,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.177 align:middle line:90%
that would be our guideline.

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Now what is the boundary?

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you know, when
is it time to say no?

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:90%
When is it OK to say no?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you go to that
inner feeling about it?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I go to the inner feeling,
but it's almost as if I

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:90%
envision a flow of a river.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And if the river keeps
flowing out to everybody else,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
after a while, it
has no place else--

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:90%
it's not coming from any source.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:90%
It can dry up.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:10%
You see what I'm saying?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm open to all of
these other streams coming

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
into the river, then
the river just flows.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So what I feel is I can
have the sense inside me

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
where I've gotten out of
touch with feeling peaceful,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:90%
with feeling happy.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel like some energy
beyond me is driving me.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I know,
that's not sacred energy.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:84%
That's just a work
addiction energy.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a different feeling.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So it is a feeling.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And I know I honor that feeling.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.112 align:middle line:84%
If I ask, do I want to do
this and I'm going to do this,

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and how does the body
respond, and you actually

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
get a physical
reaction to something

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
you really don't want to do.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, before I got
sick, I was so out of touch

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
with what my body was telling
me that I didn't pay attention.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.263 align:middle line:84%
But now I really am paying
much more attention.

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so much wisdom in
my body to just listen to.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:29.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you found that?

00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the next point that you make
is distinguish between tasks.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you mean
by distinguishing?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those of us who are
recovering perfectionists

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and not just recovering
attorneys think that everything

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
we do has to be done perfectly,
including making my bed.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I know this one, right?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I need to do is to
decide that I'm not going to do

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:90%
everything well.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.563 align:middle line:84%
There are some things I'm
going to do well enough.

00:07:56.563 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:90%
And my bed is like--

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:90%
it's not perfect, but it's made.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And for years, I would
suffer, even just

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.963 align:middle line:90%
doing something like that.

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:10%
But what I find is
important is for me to say,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:10%
if I'm going to do one thing
today, what is that one

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:10%
thing that matters most?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.098 align:middle line:90%
And to focus on that.

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And then to say, I'm not going
to accomplish the whole thing.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to write
an article in one day.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to spend
an hour this morning.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.155 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that, I'm going

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:90%
to stop no matter where I am.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's your point
too, to schedule finite time

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
for tasks.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
That's another point
that you've made.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can take
all day doing this,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
or you can allot one hour.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that the idea?

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are naturally
open ended, go with the flow,

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
don't like to be restricted.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like going
into the shadow part of myself,

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
the lesser-known part
of myself to do this.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:10%
But, Georgia, when
I've been able to say

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to stop at 10
o'clock and that's it,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:10%
I have a great sense of freedom.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course I have to
live with the guilt.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.687 align:middle line:84%
But you know what they say about
feel the guilt and keep going.

00:08:55.687 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And I do keep going.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I leave it behind.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.202 align:middle line:84%
And you know what the other--
then all kinds of gifts emerge.

00:09:00.202 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, I might
have been right so much

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of what
I'm writing that I don't

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:90%
have the perspective on it.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:10%
So to step aside and go out for
a walk gives me perspective.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.565 align:middle line:84%
I can come back and rewrite the
whole thing in much less time

00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:84%
than if I spent the
whole day doing it.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You probably found that
out with your writing.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:90%
It really does work.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I did
as I wrote my book.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I had to be disciplined.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is a discipline
that is very productive.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is a point at which
it's no longer productive.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you give two
hours for this,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
if that's what works
for you, that's

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:90%
what you're talking about.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And we can apply
that in many aspects,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:90%
many areas of our lives.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as you
were saying that,

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Herman Melville's words were
echoing in my mind, which is,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
"There is a woe that is wisdom
and a wisdom that is madness."

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.013 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] OK.

00:09:45.013 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And there is a sense
of discipline where

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly,
constantly moving.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And that can be crazy.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:10%
And then there is a
wisdom which is saying,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:10%
I will focus on this, and
I'll allow all the light

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:10%
to just be focused on this.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's enough.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of power
in that focusing.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
You really have to
to be at your best.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Now acknowledging
the inner saboteur.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, are you
familiar with that one?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have committees in
our heads that are telling us,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:90%
you did that wrong.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You made this mistake.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:90%
You'll never get it right.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't even try.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have so many voices.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I've decided to do
is to just greet them and say,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.588 align:middle line:84%
I hear you, but I
don't agree with you.

00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And this other thing
that I started doing--

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:10%
my son is a wonderful young
man, but when he was five,

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:10%
he had difficulties learning--

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:10%
attention deficit, which
many children have.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And instead of berating himself,
Nick would say, silly me.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it took me until I was
43 years old to stop saying,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're so bad at this.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You're so-- I stopped doing
that kind of negative self-talk.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
I stopped the saboteur.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would say things
now like, OK, darling, you

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:90%
made a mistake.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.075 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn from it?

00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Or, OK, sweetie,
you've done enough.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Just take a break.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise that
driving voice can drive us

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
into work addiction and
become so loud that it

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
replaces the quiet inner
voice that says, take it easy.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.567 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're going to do is
just take a break in just a few

00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
minutes because there are
several things that I think we

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%
really need to talk about.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to share with
us self-care affirmations.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And these are words of
wisdom that our audience

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:90%
can write down.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to
do a bibliography

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of nine wonderful books
that are very powerful.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So you may want to get paper
and pencil because we need

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
to walk through these things.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we can change
our lives, can we not?

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes we can, especially if
we cooperate with something

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:90%
bigger.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I love taking this approach
to it because this is helpful.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
doing, Holly Bruno.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It changed my life.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, on your journey.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we're going

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to have lots of words of wisdom
that you may want to hold,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
affirmations that
may change your life,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and also some books that
may be very helpful for you.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.534 align:middle line:90%
So we will be right back.

00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:01.456 align:middle line:90%

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're just joining
us, Holly Bruno

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is sharing her wisdom
and her light with us

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
because she came from
being an attorney,

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and she is now honoring the
spiritual side of herself,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
finding her own peace,
her own way to come home.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to share
with you, she suggested,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
self-care affirmations.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And you really like that self
care concept, do you not?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I sure do.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And affirmations are so much
at the center of it for me

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.193 align:middle line:84%
because I need to
hear my own voice

00:12:34.193 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and listen to my own voice
being gentle with myself.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So I-- this is
so telling, Georgia.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, I was
working in a place

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
where people were encouraging me
to take a look at affirmations

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and to write them.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And my first response was,
well, I'll write them,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
but somebody else better
record them in their voice,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
not my voice--

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.182 align:middle line:84%
the idea that my voice
wouldn't be good enough.

00:12:57.182 --> 00:12:59.765 align:middle line:84%
>> And, see, your voice is the
best voice for your own psyche.

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:00.565 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's exactly right, but
I didn't know that at the time.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote these affirmations,
and sometimes it's

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
like books are
written within us.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:84%
These affirmations just emerged,
and so they were already in me.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to be
open to hearing them.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So I would bet that anyone
who writes their affirmations

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
will just find
that they're there.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of
just finding them.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ones that came
to me was I have the right

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to dream again and
to follow my dreams.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm, I like that.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.720 align:middle line:10%
>> You see, I wasn't
living my life,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:10%
so I wasn't even in
touch with my dream.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.685 align:middle line:84%
And without a dream,
what is my life?

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Another very simple
one is I am enough.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Short and sweet.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I am enough.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be surprised how
many times I've had to use that.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's another one
that comes from 12 step

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
recovery, which I
adore, and it's,

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I have the right to do less
than is humanly possible.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is very good.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, one that is so short
and sweet-- that is Louise Hay.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
She ends things
with "All is well."

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And that is so easy.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You asked me some
of my favorites,

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and I chose three from the book.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I am a powerful spiritual being,
and I choose a healthy body.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.783 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that I
continue on the body.

00:14:15.783 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to take
care of the body, do we not?

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I am powerful and capable.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.095 align:middle line:84%
I create beauty and
love in my life.

00:14:24.095 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I like that one, too.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That is beautiful,
and that becomes true.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And one I love, I accept
love and support in my life

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and share it with others.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.182 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you said that
because that's something that

00:14:35.182 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
really was difficult for me, and
it's been a change in my life

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:90%
that's so important.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:10%
When someone would give me
a compliment-- for example,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:10%
she would say, I
love your dress.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I would say, oh, I got this
at the bargain basement.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
[GROAN]

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And what that does-- if
you had said that to me, I

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
love your dress, and
I just said I got it

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.355 align:middle line:84%
at the bargain basement,
what would that do to you?

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:53.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yeah.

00:14:53.522 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It would certainly--

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.688 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes that energy down.

00:14:55.688 --> 00:14:56.855 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes the energy away.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
you are on notice not

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to give me more
compliments because you're

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:90%
going to get put down.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:90%
And you know what I was doing?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I was protecting myself.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
This is so sad.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I was keeping the loving energy
away from me by doing that.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's like
accepting a gift,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.828 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a verbal gift
or-- and you say, oh, no, no,

00:15:14.828 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that or something.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to
say is thank you.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It is that simple, isn't it?

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I needed to-- what
I had to-- because I'm a tough

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I had to say to my
spiritual source,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
please help me feel loved
in every cell in my body.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So then I could just accept
that kindness and say thank you.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I've
discovered in self care

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we're so focused on
caring for other people--

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> --that we're so used to
being all things to everyone

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.592 align:middle line:90%
but ourselves.

00:15:44.592 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:10%
That it's really-- what I've
gotten in touch with is I just

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:10%
cannot be present to anyone else
if I'm not present to myself.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> First you must nurture
yourself in order for you

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to have the power to
take care of others too.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got on the airplane
flying down here from Boston,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
they always say this, and it
always strikes me as so strange

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:90%
but so true.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You know when the
oxygen masks come down?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what they say?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They say, don't attempt to
help the person next to you

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
until you have the mask
securely on your own face.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That is profound.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do we need to
be reminded of that?

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to
remind us of this.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Celebrate the little
things, or celebrate

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:90%
the tiny things in life.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what that philosophy is,
and what do you mean by that?

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's so hard.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I think in terms of giving
and receiving of gifts,

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
it's so comfortable to
give to someone else,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's so uncomfortable
to take for myself.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
That when I do something,
I need to honor that.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I need to celebrate that.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:10%
So even if it's just something
like buying myself flowers,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:10%
that is such a great thing.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I encourage
people to do this,

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I just say, let's just make
a deal, just one little thing

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:90%
you'll do for yourself.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
The flurry of denial--

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I won't do that.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with just
one small celebration,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:90%
and it builds.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you have recommended
nine books that we could read.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And I ask if you would just give
us a little bit of information

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Now the first three that
we're going to take a look at,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:90%
why have you chosen these?

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
"Addicted to Perfection," and
you can see it on the monitor

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Why would you recommend
that particular book?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>> "Addicted to Perfection" is
very powerful because it talks

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:10%
about the conditioning that
women in particular have

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:10%
to lose respect for ourselves
and lose touch with our own

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:10%
voice and to identify instead
with the good, the nice--

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:10%
it sounds like a soap opera--

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:10%
the good person
we're supposed to be,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:10%
the nice person, the perfect
person we're supposed to be.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult
because it essentially

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:10%
says that I disenfranchise
myself from my source of power

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.655 align:middle line:10%
by trying to be perfect.

00:17:55.655 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mentioned
that word perfect,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and that's that key word.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.143 align:middle line:84%
We're used to making the
bed perfectly or doing this

00:18:01.143 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
perfectly, and
that's where you've

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
said, again, to forgive
ourselves a little bit.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> On "Dancing on My Grave,"
now tell me about that,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
the message in that.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so powerful.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:84%
A number of us as women
have eating disorders.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was written by a person
with an eating disorder who

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
felt that to be
the best ballerina,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:90%
she had to stop eating.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
She had to deny
her own sustenance

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to be perfect as a dancer.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we look at that, we
really have to love ourselves

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and love ourselves as
we are, love our body.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.312 align:middle line:84%
And we really have to get
past that outside approval

00:18:37.312 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves with
eating disorders.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Listen, I need to because
my natural body is not

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:90%
a toothpick.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it ever was,
except maybe when I was five.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And this sad thing that
we have this image of not

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:84%
being beautiful
just as we are is

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:90%
something I work on every day.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But to have a dancer
who didn't feel she

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
could be accepted unless
she was so svelte.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is now, people are
really working on this to allow

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.465 align:middle line:84%
for dancers to be
all different shapes.

00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's a steady, slow process.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The third book
that you recommend

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
is "A History of God."

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, now that's wonderful.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Aren't we all?

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the bottom of all of
this, of your work, of my work,

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
is the question, who is God,
and who does God want me to be?

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about God, I'm
open to anyone's view of God

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:90%
or the universe or whatever.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:10%
But this book goes
through the history

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:10%
of how people have seen God
and then allows each one of us

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:10%
to say, all right, so
someone in a desert society

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:10%
saw God living in a
wonderful, lush jungle.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:10%
What kind of desert am I in,
and what do I see God as,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:10%
and what is God truly to me?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.655 align:middle line:84%
>> In the next little series
of books that you recommended,

00:19:50.655 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
"Do What You Love and
the Money Will Follow."

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that a
wonderful affirmation?

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's sort
of self-explanatory.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.368 align:middle line:84%
But what about
"Facing Codependency"?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
That's still an issue
with a lot of people.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
We've been working on that
as a society collectively,

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and that codependency is
really out there, is it not?

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Codependency means that
I'm out of touch with who I am

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so involved
in meeting someone

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:90%
else's expectations.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.782 align:middle line:90%
I meet that every day.

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And it isn't psychobabble.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:90%
It's reality.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's ruining people's lives.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's
absolute reality.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
The Stone Center at
Wellesley College

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
has a piece of
information I find

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
fascinating that says that
girls, when we're born,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:84%
learn as much about how
to take care of our moms

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
as our moms are
teaching us how to--

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically we're focusing on
our mom and giving care as well

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:90%
as taking care.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And who is the perfect
woman, by the way--

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
the book?

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I have not met her.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.185 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:47.185 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Or are you looking
at her in the mirror?

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what?

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.295 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us is
exactly perfect as we are.

00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's Pia
Mellody, who wrote

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:10%
that book says that we need
to befriend our perfectly

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:10%
imperfect natures.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I like that.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Now in the last group, you
have "Reinventing Work."

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And how do we need to look
at our work differently?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Matthew Fox, wonderful
writer and speaker,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
says that work and spirituality
have been separated off so that

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
work is just producing money,
or work is just a livelihood.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:10%
But work today needs
to have meaning.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of what
I do is to invite

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:10%
people to find-- re-find, again,
the meaning in their work.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if my work
is fulfilling,

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:90%
it's spiritually fulfilling.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
bringing home money.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And people burn out unless
they have that spiritual base.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So what Matthew Fox
is saying is it's

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:90%
OK to do work that's spiritual.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very much like--

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
what's our friend from PBS?

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The man who said
do what you love.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Joseph Campbell.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love Joseph.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Do what you love.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am so pleased that
you have been sharing with us.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just mention
your last two, "Zen

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Art of Making a Living"
and "Work with Passion."

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But we really are, in this
bottom line, what you're

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:90%
saying, self care, soul care.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Come back to who you are.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The thing is,
there's never going

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to be another one of
you or me, so why not

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.965 align:middle line:90%
accept it and enjoy it?

00:22:11.965 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The beautiful, perfect
women that we are.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And each of
you out there too.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the exciting
part, that you really

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:90%
need to love yourself.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:84%
What we're going
to do is let you

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
know how you can be in touch
with Holly Bruno for self care

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.397 align:middle line:90%
and soul care.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Really the lesson is
sacrifice need not

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:90%
be a synonym for kindness.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is the bottom line that
Holly wanted to share with us,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
coming home to ourselves,
self care, soul care.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.057 align:middle line:84%
I'm so pleased that you
could be with us today,

00:23:02.057 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:90%
"Living in Balance."

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm Shakti-Hill.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And will you please learn to
live in balance in mind, body,

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, may you be
well, happy, and peaceful.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:90%
