00:00:01.783 --> 00:00:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I want to welcome you
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.720 align:middle line:10%
Our subject today is about
relationship and health,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.180 align:middle line:10%
and we are going to look
at it from the perspective

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.040 align:middle line:10%
of the power of now.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
Eckhart Tolle has been
described as the modern mystic.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of
"The Power of Now,"

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked him if he
would talk with us today

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
about the power of now
and how we can relate it

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
on such a practical and
important level as relationship

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and also about our
health and suffering.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So that is the subject.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You are the author of this
wonderful book that thousands

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of people have read, and
also, thousands of people

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
have been drawn to come
and listen to you talk.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You are a guru to some, and
you said, I liked your analogy.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You're a window through
which the light can shine.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, people don't
really come to see me.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:10%
They come to see that which
comes through this form.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:10%
It's everybody's destiny
to come a little bit more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:10%
transparent to the light of
consciousness shining through,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:10%
and so people come to be
more fully with themselves

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.083 align:middle line:10%
rather than come to see another
person when they come to talks.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've asked if we could
concentrate on relationship.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I just loved your
information that you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:84%
shared through the "Power
of Now" about relationship.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It puts it in such
a perspective.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
it as relationship

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.277 align:middle line:84%
as practice in spirituality
or spiritual practice,

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
how we can work with
our relationships

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
from that perspective.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many that
are painful, so many

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
that are addictive, and that
have a negative aspect to them,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
to be like that.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:90%
They should not be.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it seems that
relationships are a great

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
source of both pleasure and
suffering for many people.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
experienced how easily

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
the pleasure of a relationship
can turn into suffering

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly that
can happen, how easily

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
it seems that love can turn
into hate in relationships.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It can happen within a second.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a source
of great suffering there

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:90%
for many people.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that there's so much
conflict in relationships?

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And does it have to be that way?

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look at what the
source of that conflict may be.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Now most people
experience periodic drama

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
in their relationships, once
a week, every other day,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:90%
depending on the relationship.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can become addicted to
the drama itself because it is

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
emotional, it is intense,
and we experience it.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
painful, it's intense.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there is something
that one could almost call

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
an addiction to suffering
in most human beings,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
but that's mostly unconscious
or they don't know that they are

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
addicted to suffering.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And what that is is
not so much caused--

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
it seemingly caused
by the relationship,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is that human
beings over thousands

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of years of history
have created so much

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
suffering for themselves.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
human history, you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
see the atrocities,
almost continuous warfare

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:90%
that's been going on.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So that has left traces in the
human collective consciousness,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and those are residues
of past human suffering.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Even the planet itself
carries an energy

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
field of suffering collectively
in a collective psyche.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Through all these generations
and ancestors we've known.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I call
that the pain body.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a residue of
past emotional suffering,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
both the past of humanity
and your own personal past

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because every child suffers
in one way or another.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So all the emotional
suffering that you go to

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is added to the pain
body, the emotional sphere

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
of suffering that you've already
come into this world with.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
So this pain body--

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
now I'm going to look
at it for a moment

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
as if it were almost
an independent entity,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
it's an emotional energy
field that lives in you,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and the pain body is
not always active.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
It has a dormant period
when you can hardly feel it

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and everything seems to be fine.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And then it has an
active period when

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
it needs to come up and feed
again, add to its suffering

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:90%
by creating more suffering.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So this pain body that
people carry inside

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
from the past, past
emotion, periodically

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
comes out of its
dormant state and seeks

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
some further
experience of suffering

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
because that is the energy
vibration that it feeds on.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that happens,
a little trigger awakens

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
the pain body, something
relatively insignificant

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in your
relationship, your partner

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
says something, makes a
comment, and suddenly, there's

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
an enormous reaction
out of proportion

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to the significance of
the triggering effect,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and the pain body came up
because it needed to feed.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So the pain body
feeds into ways.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It feeds on your mind by
rising up into your thoughts

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and making your thought
processes very negative.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They become negative
and self-destructive,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
destructive of self or others.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So every negative thought has
a certain frequency vibration

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to it, which corresponds to the
emotional frequency of the pain

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And some pain bodies are
predominantly angry pain

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Other pain bodies are
predominantly sad or extremely

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:90%
turbulent or fearful.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But we all know
that pain body.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.897 align:middle line:84%
And we know how it can come
up, and it's disproportionate,

00:06:32.897 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
as you said, to what has
actually happened to us.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But we can dissolve
the pain body.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, now the pain
body will try to feed,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
to add to its energy.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It wants you to
completely identify

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
with that energy field
that represents that it is,

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
so it will feed on your mind.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But in relationships,
it will also

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
feed on reactions, your
partner's reactions.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
It will unconsciously--
of course,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
you don't know that when
you identified with it.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that this
is what you're doing.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You will try to make
your partner react

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way that
feeds your pain body,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
also by provoking
anger, for example.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's done unconsciously,
so the reaction, your partner's

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
reaction, will be
feeding your pain body,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and that is what I call the need
for drama in a relationship.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what I like about
this too is once you think

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
of this pain body as
a separate entity,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:90%
that you detach from it--

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and you literally then
can detach from it?

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, when you
know it is not you,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:90%
it loses its personal nature.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So, kind of, the pain that you
experience periodically then

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:90%
becomes depersonalized.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer my pain, my
identity, my painful story,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
but simply you know that
it is human pain that

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
lives in you because
there's really nothing

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
personal about these feelings.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Anger is not a personal anger.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's human anger.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the same in every human
being, the same feeling.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Sadness is the same
feeling of sadness.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Fear is fear.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:10%
But people personalize
it completely,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:10%
so the emotion
energizes and amplifies

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:10%
the mind-made sense of
self, which then becomes

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:10%
a very fearful or angry one.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:10%
>> It's mentioned that women
especially experience this

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:10%
because we really
empathize with,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.964 align:middle line:10%
we have that history
of the women of Afghan,

00:08:39.964 --> 00:08:43.070 align:middle line:10%
of Afghanistan, that had to
wear the burqas and the way that

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:10%
women have been tortured
and because they're smaller,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and they've been
raped and so forth.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So there is part of that is
part of this whole culture

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
in the whole pain
body of the race.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there is a collective
aspect to pain body in that

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
sense that certain countries
have a heavier collective pain

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
body in other countries, and
those tend to be countries

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
where many atrocities or
continuous warfare has

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern Europe, if you go
to east European countries,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes central
European countries,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you can often sense there's a
certain heaviness in the energy

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
field, and that is the
collective pain body.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of the
collective pain body

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
is that certain races who
have suffered a lot also

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:84%
have accumulated a stronger
collective pain body.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And women who have been victims,
really, for thousands of years

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
also have a collective female
pain body that I point--

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about
in the book that it

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.060 align:middle line:84%
tends to come up particularly
before menstruation in women,

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's suddenly
great emotional turmoil.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And it can take you over so
easily when you become totally

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:84%
identified with it,
and you're forced

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:90%
to act it out again and again.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:90%
So how do--

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Monthly basis.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Not that men don't
have a pain body.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
They also have a pain body, but
there's the collective aspect

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of the female pain body.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So once you know that,
then you can actually

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:84%
bring more presence into
it and simply observe

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that movement, that turbulence,
or that heaviness inside you,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't control
your thinking anymore.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
You simply feel the turbulence
or the heaviness inside you

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and watch it, so you bring
a certain amount of presence

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
to it, and that is
bringing the power of now

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:84%
into those emotions that are
part of the human pain body.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is the arising,
really, of a new state,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
a deeper, or higher state
of consciousness that is not

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
conditioned, that has the
ability to simply witness what

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:90%
is taking place.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And that shifts that
whole consciousness.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That shifts it, and you
are no longer feeling it.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:84%
When you know that
that's what it

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
is, it's less likely that
the pain body can move

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
into your mind, force you to
think certain thoughts, which,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
of course, will be negative,
and it's also less likely

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
that the pain body will
make you use your partner

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.415 align:middle line:84%
to give you more pain in its
need to reenact this drama.

00:11:28.415 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Over and over, the drama.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
We will be back in just a moment
with more of Eckhart Tolle

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.308 align:middle line:84%
and the power of now
with your health.

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking
with Eckhart Tolle.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:10%
"The Power of Now" is his
book, and the practices

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:10%
that you can learn
from "The Power of Now"

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:10%
can really assist
you in becoming

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:10%
a healthy, balanced person.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
As you know, stress is what
makes our lives so difficult

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and can bring on illness.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:84%
One technique or practice that
is so profound is surrender.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.632 align:middle line:84%
It even affects the aging
process, does it not?

00:12:07.632 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, surrender is acceptance
of this moment as it is

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:10%
because you realized the
futility of that state of inner

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:10%
resistance to what is, to simply
make this moment your friend

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:10%
rather than your enemy.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you
realize that perhaps

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
for many years, the
now, the present moment,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
you've treated it as an enemy,
trying to get away from it,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
not liking it, constantly
criticizing it.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So this transformation of
no longer internally trying

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to escape from or deny
the aliveness that

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.040 align:middle line:84%
is in this moment
that also brings

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:84%
about a transformation
in the physical body,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the contraction
that people sense, that which

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
stops the healthy
flow of life energy

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
through the body
what is called chi,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that which stops that is the
state of fearful contraction

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
that is there and how does--
where does that originate,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:84%
it's because you never
embrace this moment as it is.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
You mentally project
yourself forward

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:90%
to some possible future moment.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that gap between
now and later, fear arises.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The fear makes
the body contract,

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and that greatly impedes
the flow of life energy

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned continue
to say yes, say yes to life,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
say yes to now, say yes
to what is going on.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It really is a matter
of acceptance and going

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
with, kind of, the
flow of your life.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you are in fear, then
that's when the blockages come.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:90%
But the acceptance of the now.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we accept it.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We actually embrace it.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The now and life are one
because there is no life

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:90%
outside of now.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at it, most
people live in past and future,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
rarely in the now, so they live
in a conceptualized universe

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because now is
all there ever is.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Nothing ever
happened in the past.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It happened in the now.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will ever
happen in the future.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It will happen the now.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize
how vital it is,

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:84%
then you open yourself up to
an enormous power that is here

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
all the time that
you cut yourself

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
off from when you live in and
through mental projections

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
of past and, for many
people, future, mostly.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Now a lot of people will--

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, maybe they'll do astrology,
or they'll do I Ching,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.520 align:middle line:84%
or they'll do the
tarot, or they will

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.250 align:middle line:90%
do some form of divination.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.205 align:middle line:84%
And is it because they really
are not satisfied or not living

00:15:04.205 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
in the now, and they're
projecting into the future,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.955 align:middle line:84%
they want to see what
the future holds?

00:15:07.955 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it either dissatisfaction
with what is?

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they want
to, in some way,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
perhaps control what is
going to happen to them.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:90%
They want to know--

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
but, of course, if you knew
what is going to happen to you,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
your life would lose
all sense of adventure.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It would-- everything
would be totally fixed.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's simply-- the most
powerful spiritual practice

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.905 align:middle line:90%
is the practice of now.

00:15:34.905 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Be in the moment as
the Sufi master would say.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why they dance.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
That's why they whirl.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:90%
It brings you into the moment.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are practices
that do that now.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Some of the things--

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
one thing that you suggested
was the inner body.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And tell me about
that and how people

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
can come from the inner
body and come into the now,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:90%
be in the now.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people are cut off from
the aliveness of their body

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:84%
because all their attention
is absorbed continuously

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:90%
by thought processes there.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
completely in the head.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
That center of gravity, so
to speak, is in the mind,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
in their continuous
stream of thinking.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And what are they
thinking about?

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Probably the next
moment, the future.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They're projecting
themselves forward,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to control
it in some way,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
trying to prevent certain
things from happening,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and so they lose themselves
in the mind and in time,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:90%
in future.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So a very powerful practice
is to bring your attention

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
from the head into
the body and to feel

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the aliveness that
is always present

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout your entire body.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And it can start
with a simple thing,

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
like sensing the aliveness
that is in your hand.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And at first, some people say,
well, I can't feel anything.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes point
out, yes, you can.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
Just close your eyes,
hold up your right hand,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.957 align:middle line:84%
and without moving your hand
and without looking at it,

00:17:10.957 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
is there any way you can know
whether your right hand is

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:90%
still there?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And then they do that,
and suddenly, they

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:84%
can feel the energy
in their right hand.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
They can sense it, and
they're beginning now

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
to enter the body
with their attention.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that you
can feel the aliveness there,

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
you can very easily
feel the aliveness that

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is in the rest of the
body and then sense it

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:90%
as a general flow of aliveness.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Every cell is alive, and that
takes your attention away from

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
the mind, and also brings you
into the now because you cannot

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
be inhabiting the bodies,
one way of putting it,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
truly inhabiting the body
when you inhabit the body,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
you cannot be away from the now
that is an anchor for staying

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
present, and that is a state of
great power because we may not

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:84%
realize how much
intelligence is actually--

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
how much intelligence
lives in the body

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:90%
and in every cell of the body.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:10%
If you had to control
the workings of the body

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:10%
through your mind, the body
would break down immediately

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:10%
because it's far too complex.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Only the intelligence in the
body that is in every cell

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:10%
and in every organ can make
the body function in that way.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So the greater intelligence
that is there--

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
the one intelligence that is
there of which the human mind

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is only a tiny
aspect, how do you

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
connect with that
one intelligence

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:90%
that runs the entire universe?

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way to
connect with that

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is to start by connecting
with your inner body.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now many people are
suffering with disease.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:10%
And we know that through pain
and through disease and impact

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:10%
and trauma, we often do evolve.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
However, how can we transform
illness and suffering?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:84%
What can we do with
the power of now

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.872 align:middle line:84%
to transform illness
and suffering?

00:19:13.872 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If illness is already
there, see that you don't form

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:90%
an identity out of your illness.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't make an
identity out of it.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
You identify with it
so much that you--

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
the image forms
in your mind of me

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
as a person who has that
or is a sufferer of that.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So simply bring it down to
this moment and the reality

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
of this moment.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I speak of
surrendering to an illness,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying surrender to
the fact that you are ill.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a mental image.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Simply surrender to whatever
this moment presents

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and that maybe at
this moment, pain.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It may be disability.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It may be discomfort.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And an illness can become
your spiritual teacher

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
because it can teach you
the state of surrender,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to say yes to what
is, not to resist it.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Enormous healing
powers are released

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:84%
when you enter the stage
of nonresistance, which

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with
resignation and saying,

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
oh, I might just well accept.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to get any better.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to do with that.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You simply accept the
reality of this moment

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
as it is without constructing
a mental story on top of it.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Simply this, the
pain is there, so let

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:90%
the pain teach you surrender.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
That's how the egoic
entity, the mind-made self

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
can actually become
eroded through an illness,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:90%
and it has happened.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I have met people who have
had severe disability,

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were in
their wheelchair,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
perhaps totally incapacitated,
and I looked into their eyes,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and there was an enormous
light shining through,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:90%
an enormous aliveness.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:84%
They had surrendered
to their condition.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I met others
in the same condition,

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:84%
there was great bitterness
and anger and resentment.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They were-- they
had closed down.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And so healing is
more likely to happen,

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
much more likely to happen
in the surrendered state.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If that tenseness is
gone, the anger that--

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> All healing powers
are released in the state

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
of openness, that is
the state of surrender,

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
because the state of
nonsurrender is the state

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of closeness, shutting down,
contraction, tightness.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So the power of now can be--

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually put
ourselves in a healing state,

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.300 align:middle line:90%
being open to healing.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so the power of now is
always connected with working

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
with whatever is at this moment,
not demanding that your life

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
should be different, not
being antagonistic towards

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%
the reality of this moment.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Just render to the moment.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:90%

Living in this
moment, accepting what

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is can change our relationships,
can change our health,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
then we can truly
live in balance

in mind, body, and spirit.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:90%

you have the power of now.
