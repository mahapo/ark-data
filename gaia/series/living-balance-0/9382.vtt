00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
welcome you to "Living

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.280 align:middle line:90%
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Our program today is
going to teach you

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
what your role could be in
helping to fight world hunger.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Come join us, "Living in
Balance on Shakti-Hill."

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, fighting world hunger--
what a major project.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
It is something
that we're always

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:84%
hearing on the news
there is a need for.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There is a wonderful
organization

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that is local, that has their
international headquarters

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
right here in Southwest Florida.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did have the
opportunity of going on a tour

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
just recently, and
looking at the facility.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was wonderful to be
educated in how we might

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
help in fighting world hunger.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to meet
the executive director.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We're so pleased to
have Dr. Price with us.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is exciting.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When I met with your
developmental director, Mike

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Sullivan, he said,
did you know that this

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is the international
headquarters for ECHO?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is ECHO?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:90%
What does that stand for?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It stands for Educational
Concern for Hunger

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.345 align:middle line:90%
Organization.

00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we give free
technical assistance

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
to any organization
or individual

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
working with peasant farmers
in underdeveloped countries.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Our specialty is
helping people grow food

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:90%
under difficult conditions.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And here, some people think
that the area that we're in

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:84%
does have difficult
conditions because it's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:90%
so hot in the summertime.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a difficult area.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But you do have this
incredible place that you have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
shown, I just visited, in
the middle of the heat,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and our 90-degree
weather day after day.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're in a lush environment.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Are we not?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>> When I came--

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
moved to Florida 17
years ago, I thought

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
it was coming to
the Garden of Eden.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a little bit
of a surprise at first

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying to
grow what we grew in Ohio.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
nothing will grow here.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But once you grow
plants that God created

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of a climate--

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
we have some 400 kinds of
plants we grow at ECHO,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:90%
that will thrive right here.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
interesting because there

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
are the variety of
fruits-- and you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
have this wonderful
area that you have

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:90%
that you're so proud of.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.515 align:middle line:90%
200 varieties of--

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's 200 varieties of
tropical and subtropical fruits

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
there, grown in close spacing
so that we can get a lot

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:90%
of varieties in a small area.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And you did bring one of the
fruits that [LAUGHS] we have

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't you know that one?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the star
fruit, the famous one.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the carambola
or star fruit.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> 17 years ago, those
were pretty sour.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
You could buy them for a dime a
piece in the local supermarket.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
hardly worth eating.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have much
improved sweet varieties.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they were first
hitting the market,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
those would-- you could
get maybe $4 or $5

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:90%
for one of those.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Even now, they're probably
over $1 in the markets up

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:90%
north.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But you can grow right in
your own backyards here.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I have friends that do.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And they are sweet now.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.893 align:middle line:84%
They did have a reputation
for only being pretty before.

00:03:11.893 --> 00:03:12.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So that is our
carambola, our star fruit.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, there are
the variety of bananas.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.092 align:middle line:84%
And you have them from
all over the world,

00:03:23.092 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the different like varieties
of bananas, and many of those,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> We have, I think, it's 33
different kinds of banana.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I never even knew there were
more than one or two kinds,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.995 align:middle line:90%
before I came down here.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd asked you
about your background.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.992 align:middle line:84%
And you said that your people in
Ohio, there were some farmers.

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
There was a little bit of
farming in your background?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.783 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually grew
up on the farm that

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
my great-great-great-grandfather
cleared out of the wilderness.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So agriculture has been in
my background from day one.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, in Southern Ohio.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Southern Ohio.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, where I said also I
have family that goes back years

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that were farmers down
in that area, too.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So you and I took a nice
little walk through,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and you showed me
some of the fruit.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And there were very
varied varieties.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things that I
had not seen before.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, when I used to--

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
when I would think
of fruit, I would

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
think of apples and
pears and cherries.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
I think of Adam and Eve in
the garden probably eating

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.379 align:middle line:90%
those fruits.

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I realize, they may have
had grumichamas, imbes, wampis,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
soursops, atemoyas, canistels,
rambutans, pulasans--

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
on and on, so many
wonderful kinds of fruit.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> That's been one of the
great joys of moving to Florida

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and growing these.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I would think so.

00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But what you've done is you've
set up different areas here.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
There is a rain forest
clearing garden, for example.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where we grow plants
that can handle huge rainfalls,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and the heat and humidity
that go with them.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead of 50 inches that
we would get in Florida,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
rain forest might
have 200, 400 inches.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are plants
that will grow there.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
whole trick to this,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:90%
is just knowing--

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
so we shouldn't
have people starving

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
if they knew what they
could do, is basically what

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at?

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.103 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as there's some
water and a reasonable amount

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
of heat, there are food
plants that will grow there.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And, also, you
showed us-- and this,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.977 align:middle line:84%
I asked you about this
because we have a photo.

00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a little hard to see.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:90%
It's called rooftop gardening.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But here was-- you had
some plants growing,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and then underneath it were
all these aluminum cans.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at that.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, now who's
recycling under this tree?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I mentioned, our
specialty is growing food under

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:90%
difficult conditions.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, a cement slab
is about as difficult

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:90%
as a condition can get.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So we've worked for
several years on methods,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
very lightweight and
inexpensive methods,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
garden on rooftops.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.137 align:middle line:84%
And as we got the beds
shallower and shallower,

00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
people would say,
well, I didn't think

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.072 align:middle line:84%
you could grow corn in three
inches of soil, and so forth.

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, let's just
see how far we can push it.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So that bed has about an eighth
of an inch sheet of polyester.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we piled cola
cans on top of it,

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.272 align:middle line:84%
and we keep it continually moist
with the fertilizer solution.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't grow corn
on it, but we're

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
doing a very nice okra, which
is a big plant like this.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And peppers and herbs
do very well on it.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's more educational
than anything else.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:90%
But it does work.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's one of the
purposes of your farm.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call it, a farm.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you do also have a
nice variety of animals there.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
We visited with
your animals, too.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:84%
We have those
because, as I said,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
our specialty is helping
people in third world countries

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:90%
on small farms.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And the interns that
come through ECHO

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
need to-- even though
our specialty is plants,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
they need to know
about all of the things

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that a small farmer
will deal with.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a kind
of hair sheep, which

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.325 align:middle line:90%
is a sheep that loses its wool.

00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:90%
It just falls off.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.628 align:middle line:84%
That's better for the
tropics because you

00:06:46.628 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
don't have to learn all the
things about shearing them.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the heat,
it's a lot better

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.275 align:middle line:90%
not having that wool on there.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's a meat sheep.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
We have nubian goats for milk.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
At our conference
this fall, we're

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
going to have a local lady teach
about how to make cheese out

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of the goat's milk.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I've tasted it.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.153 align:middle line:90%
It's really wonderful.

00:07:02.153 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think our
feta cheese-- well,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.212 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the Greek cheeses
are from goat milk.

00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.908 align:middle line:90%
And then we have tilapia fish.

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:10%
That would be the fish that
Christ's disciples probably

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:10%
caught in the Sea of
Galilee, and bees.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I liked about
this-- and as we walk through,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
first of all, you took us to
this little section that had

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
the chickens.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the chickens
were being rotated.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And so it was a
combination of the chickens

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and a rotational
system with the plants.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is that
the chickens will fertilize.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you
rotate them, you

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
can plant, then, where
the chickens had been.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that not the concept?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:90%
We have three parts.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.868 align:middle line:84%
Two parts always have
vegetables growing on them.

00:07:40.868 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:90%
The other one has the chickens.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're eating the
insects from the previous--

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
from the vegetables that used
to be growing in that part--

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
eating the insect
eggs, scratching up

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the weeds as the
seeds germinate,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and putting a little fertilizer
spread around all over.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, at the
appropriate time, we'll

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
move the chickens into a garden
that's just finished, and then

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:90%
plant this in the garden.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And then, just try to rotate.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So not only do they
fertilize, but they also, then,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
control the insects--

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And the weeds.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --and the weeds.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how perfect.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But one doesn't think about
it like-- well, you do.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's the
educational part.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I hadn't
thought about that

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
process until we walked
through on the tour.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And we also saw that, as you
mentioned, there are ducks.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:90%
There are the tilapia fish.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have combined
them together

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:90%
in a kind of a harmony, also.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very common
in Southeast Asia,

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.050 align:middle line:84%
where they will use ducks
on the water and housed over

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:90%
the water.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
You want all the manure
to fall into the pond.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Then the tilapia
fish can live off

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
of the microorganisms that
grow off of this manure.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
They have a thing called
gill rakers, so they can--

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to
eat particles of food.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
They can eat off of
the microorganisms.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the tilapia, again, are
the fish that we do think are

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:90%
the fish from the last supper.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Was that--

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's quite possible.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, they would have
been in the Sea of Galilee.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, OK.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little sacred
aspect to it there, too.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the work that
you have done,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
you feel-- and you and
I talked about this.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So many of the people who
come and share with us

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
talk about how good
they feel about the work

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that they have been
able to accomplish.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything in their life has
brought them up to this point.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So you are serving well, and
you're feeling good about--

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I can identify with that.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
When I was finishing my
page in biochemistry,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I began thinking there ought to
be a more practical way to use

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:90%
science to help the poor.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I was working on some rather
obscure research topics.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.507 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
a 10-year odyssey.

00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt I was
on the way somewhere else.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But when I moved down here 17
years ago, from that point on,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I've just felt this is
where I was supposed to be,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, will be here
until the day I retire.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you have
brought some plants.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And what was one
of the fun things,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
as we walked through here,
is that we were able to--

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
it's called an edible
landscape nursery.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So you nibble as you go.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, what have you
brought us today

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can show us
and share with us here?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.533 align:middle line:84%
This tree, it's
actually a shrub.

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
They'll get about
eight feet tall.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
It's called chia.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It probably would have
been eaten by the Aztecs

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
in Central America.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It grows very well
here in Florida

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
because it resists both the
heat and humidity and rain

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
of the summer, and the huge
droughts that we can have here

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And you cook the
leaves like a spinach.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You have to cook
them about 10 minutes

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of a toxic substance,
and it's just very nice.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Coming out of the
North, people think

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
a garden is something you
have to plant every year.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a eye opener
to realize you can

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:90%
have perennial vegetables here.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
You plant one of these, you'll
eat off of it for 10 years.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was kind
of interested in this.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And you had given me
a huge leaf from here.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But you did warn me to boil it
for 10 minutes first because

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:90%
of the toxicity.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But this would be, then,
a green that I could have.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And if I liked the
taste, this would

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
be as in lieu of like, a spinach
or any kind of the greens

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that we eat--
collards or whatever.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Most greens taste like
what you put on them.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:84%
If you put vinegar
on our greens,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:90%
this will taste like vinegar.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.795 align:middle line:84%
It's so good for your
health and things, too.

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this one is
very high in nutrition.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.383 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the
Moringa tree, from India.

00:11:18.383 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:84%
It's called Mother's Best
Friend in the Philippines,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.653 align:middle line:90%
where they've tried it.

00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
You pull off these
little leaflets

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and make a puree out
of them for babies.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, there's
a place we just

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
heard of where they're
drying the leaves,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.375 align:middle line:84%
making them into
a little powder,

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and then dispensing them, like
a prescription, to mothers

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
that aren't able to give milk.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And, reportedly, within
a couple of weeks,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
they're back to being
able to feed their babies.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, one of the
things that one of our doctors

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that came on talked about
was if the one thing

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
that he could help
people improving

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
their health-- if they would
combine or add to their diet

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
two cups of greens a day, it
would make all the difference

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
in their health.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
important, is it not?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, this will be--

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That is a fruit.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a passion fruit.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.686 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Passion fruit, yes.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean what people
think the word implies,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.617 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Oh, OK.

00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, it lowers blood
pressure a little bit.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But it has a wonderful
tropical flavor.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And people in the tropics
all over, of course, know it.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But here in Florida, probably
most people that could grow it

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:90%
don't know that it's so good.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So this will be, then, a
passion fruit, as we go.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I also saw that you'd had a
couple more here that we had.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be talking about them

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:90%
after we go on break.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So we'll talk more about those.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And also, you brought some
books, and about the people.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the people
who are involved,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.593 align:middle line:84%
that's very important for us
to know who are the volunteers

00:12:42.593 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and the students
and the teachers.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you will
stay tuned, we will

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
be right back with more of
ECHO and fighting world hunger.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We are talking to
Dr. Martin Price.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking about ECHO,
the organization whose purpose

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:90%
is to fight world hunger.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways is that people

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
need to be trained
in how to irrigate.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And you do have a wonderful pump
[LAUGHS] that I think they say

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
cost less than $20 to make
or was made of things--

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called a
rope washer pump.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- the
important thing is the people

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with not
only couldn't afford

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
to buy a commercial pump.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.505 align:middle line:84%
But if it broke, they
wouldn't know how to fix it.

00:13:30.505 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is so
simple, it's made out

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
of nothing except PVC pipe,
rope, and some old tires,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and one little piece of wood.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
demonstrated another pump

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
that you-- that's
a hand pump, too.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And that one is developed
by a volunteer of ECHO's, up

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
in Sarasota, that you just put
a-- it's composed of PVC pipe

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.063 align:middle line:90%
and a marble.

00:13:53.063 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe those are the
only components in it.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> But it really pumps well.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a matter,
again, of educating us

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
on how we can help,
and then also--

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:90%
and educating the people.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's the fun
process of the way you

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:90%
bring the interns in.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell us about the
educational aspect.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Besides the tours, that the
local people and the visiting

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
people can go on, what is the
student aspect and interns?

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
We have interns and we have
people that come to study.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
The interns is a paid position.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
These are college graduates with
a strong Christian commitment

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that are thinking
strongly of becoming

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
missionaries and wanting to
work in the area of agriculture.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.485 align:middle line:84%
And they work for us
for a year in Florida.

00:14:38.485 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we send them to
Haiti, where they actually

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
practice what we've been
teaching them in a third world

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:90%
setting.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Then, students come.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
actually undergraduates

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
coming for credit or it
might be a missionary.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Right now we have
a British girl who

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
was a missionary in
Kenya for a year.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And now she's over
here, studying.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And, for the first
time this year,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we have two interns who are
actually from Africa-- one

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
a white African from Zimbabwe,
and the other a black African

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:90%
from Congo.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.313 align:middle line:84%
We met the English girl and
the gentleman from Zimbabwe,

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and talked about them.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about
her experience in Haiti.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of that
program, three months in Haiti,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:84%
which must be, as you
and I had talked about,

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:90%
an incredible culture shock.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
read about poverty.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
making friends

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and then they come to you and
say, would you give me $2,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and you realize it might
be almost the life or death

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
situation because they need
this drug or something--

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and yet they don't want us
to interfere with the culture

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:90%
and get a dependency created.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So that you can just
see them agonizing

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:90%
through these decisions.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can't tell them
what the right answer is.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The young man from Zimbabwe,
he said that they also

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
had this diversity as far
as income and the people

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
who were destitute.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And he hoped to work in his
country, in his own country,

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:90%
but in Africa, for sure.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So they will learn
here, and then they

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:90%
will go back to their--

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the whole idea.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It kind of breaks our
heart, continually.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll get really bonded to
these people for a year or so,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.915 align:middle line:90%
and then we say goodbye.

00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Every two months, we're saying
goodbye to another intern.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] And you
also have volunteers.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.645 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wonderful
aspect of the program.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And those are people who
come in and give, I think,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:84%
they said 12,000 hours
a year or something.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> 12,000 volunteer hours,
including one volunteer,

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
a 73-year-old fellow from West
Virginia who is volunteering

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
full time in Kenya on
an agricultural project.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And all the others are
here in this country.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we did see, also, one of
our favorite people, Kay Kood.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And she is a person who is
there teaching the herbs,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and about the herb
gardening and so forth.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> She's been an incredible
addition to our--

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> To the staff.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --to our staff there--
gives workshops on herbs

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
for the public, as well as
training our own students

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:90%
in depth.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
some of the plants.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:90%
But you also had two more here.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was one
that you had brought.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this one.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.267 align:middle line:84%
All of these plants
come from what

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:05.787 align:middle line:84%
we call our edible landscape
workshop, our nursery.

00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more
frustrating than going

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.025 align:middle line:84%
to the botanic garden and
seeing all these plants you'd

00:17:10.025 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
like to have, but there's
no way to get them.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is katuk.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Borneo.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It's an edible hedge
there, very nutritious,

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and tastes about like a
green pea, if you eat it raw.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful, and
they'll thrive right

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:25.727 align:middle line:90%
through the summer.

00:17:25.727 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And you also have a
philodendron that has

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:90%
an edible--

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:84%
the one philodendron
that has edible--

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the only philodendron
that is edible, here.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:90%
It's called monstera.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It has a very peculiar
looking fruit.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
It looks maybe like a
cross between a pine cone

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and an ear of corn.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it gets ripe, you
flake off little white segments

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.665 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- you can't
describe what it's like,

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:90%
but it's a wonderful fruit.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I've tasted that,
because Kay has brought it,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:90%
which is wonderful.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And she shared it
with us before.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things you
also have there is a bookstore.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, you are educating people,
and the famous ECHO Seeds

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:90%
can be purchased there.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But there are lots of
really fascinating books

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:90%
that are available.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We stock books for the
tourists that come through

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and the local people
that come through related

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
to gardening in Florida.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But also, books for
people in our network.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a book on
basic camel keeping.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You brought that one.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.575 align:middle line:84%
So not everyone needs to
know about camels, but--

00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We have two audiences,
and one audience does.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Also, we have-- and you said
this was one of your favorites,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:90%
too, is "The Green Pharmacy."

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is by James Duke.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is really how
one heals through food.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> He was head of
the USDA Department

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of Agriculture's work
on medicinal plants.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And now he's retired, and
he's doing more writing.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
He's quite knowledgeable on all
the medicinal uses of plants.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's really interesting
how one can blend modern

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
medicine and the ancient
ways that have been used

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
for centuries using the herbs
and the greens and so forth.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And now, scientifically
we're proving how--

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.686 align:middle line:90%
>> We're finding why.

00:19:01.686 --> 00:19:02.022 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of wonderful.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.775 align:middle line:10%
You have a beautiful
new building that--

00:19:07.775 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It is going to be
just delightful.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.425 align:middle line:84%
>> With a Florida surround
style porch of the old Florida

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:14.225 align:middle line:90%
houses.

00:19:14.225 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is a result, you said, of
the generosity of three people.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Primarily one
person and a couple

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
other individuals gave
major gifts so every dime

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that contributors give to our
ministry has gone to ministry.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't gone to
build that building.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And I asked you
about your funding.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And you said that
you really do receive

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
from-- its non-denominational,
but tell us

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%
about how ECHO is funded.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> About 60% of our money
comes from individuals all over

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:90%
the USA and Canada.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And the rest come
from a big assortment

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
of churches and civic
clubs, and a few companies.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.557 align:middle line:84%
>> So the churches, when
they have a missionary fund,

00:19:52.557 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
then you might be
the recipient from--

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> We might be.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> --the missionary fund.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this for 17 years.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about how it's
impacted on your life

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and the lives of other people.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.615 align:middle line:84%
What is the essence of this
sharing that you have done?

00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:07.415 align:middle line:90%
What has happened?

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And is there good news
about world hunger?

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:84%
When I get a report like when
talking about them moringa

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
leaves and women that
weren't able to give milk

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for their children,
and now they are,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that project resulted
from information

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:84%
we had sent to a missionary
with the Church World Service.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a courtesy, if
you'd like to stay tuned,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
of how you can be in touch
with Dr. Martin and ECHO.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And you might want to
write a little note,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
come and visit or
perhaps make a donation.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.294 align:middle line:84%
So, if you will stay tuned,
we will be right back.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
We also wanted to thank
Bush Entertainment

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
for the additional
footage that was

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
supplied of the tour of ECHO.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things Dr. Price
and I were just talking about

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
was that everything
there is organic.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
farming is organic.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have all
sorts of recipes

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:90%
for pesticides and fungicides.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have a website
that people can visit.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We have several hundred
pages of technical information

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:90%
on our website.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.757 align:middle line:84%
If they search for ECHO in
Fort Myers, they'll probably--

00:21:42.757 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
probably be the best
way, rather than trying

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:90%
to memorize the address.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can find you in
any search engine, probably.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we really want to
thank you for what you are doing

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and the gifts that
you are sharing.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is no higher
purpose, really,

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
than to help the people in
the third world countries

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
to help themselves.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.772 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really what you're

00:22:01.772 --> 00:22:03.670 align:middle line:84%
doing in the educating
and the training

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.963 align:middle line:90%
that you're accomplishing.

00:22:05.963 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We feel very fortunate to
be able to make a difference.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And we feel, too, that
if people are educated

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
in how they can
help and how they

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
can help with the environment,
by coming on the tours

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, then they can
also be better citizens.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.988 align:middle line:90%
>> And thank you for having me.

00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And we want to thank
you for joining us today,
