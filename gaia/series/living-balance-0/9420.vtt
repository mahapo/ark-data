00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And I can't wait to share
the program with you

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.050 align:middle line:10%
today that we are going
to do on Feng Shui

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.300 align:middle line:10%
and I Ching with
two beautiful women

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.850 align:middle line:10%
who have created a business
called Design Difference.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have so much
information to share with us.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll just get started as
soon as we can, "Living

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:90%
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.300 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I Ching and Feng Shui--
isn't it fascinating

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
how the language of China is
coming into our everyday living

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and people are getting to
understand the gifts that there

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
are in other cultures
to share with us?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have two
gifts today, two women

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
who are going to share with us
much wisdom and light about I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Ching and Feng Shui.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having us.

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Rosemary and Abbi, we are
so pleased to have you with us.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And you have created a business
called Design Difference.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And you've incorporated
all the wisdom

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.028 align:middle line:84%
that you have from
years of experience.

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't even know
where we should begin.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But, Rosemary, you
have written a book--

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, with my husband.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.307 align:middle line:84%
>> --that is called--
co-authored with your husband,

00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:23.162 align:middle line:84%
who is a famous
professor from MIT.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:23.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he is.

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] And you, yourself,
have an incredible background

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:90%
in the Chinese philosophy.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:10%
I taught Chinese Civilization
at Endicott College in Beverly,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:10%
Mass for a few years.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And then I went on
to Harvard Ed School.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And everything I ever
learned, I have to say,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:10%
I learned at Harvard.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, good for Harvard.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we have Feng
Shuied the set today.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We have so many beautiful
things you have brought.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
talking about all of them.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And each of them will
change the energy.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Every single item has
a certain energy to it.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And, Abbi, you said you've been
an intuitive-- a practicing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
intuitive for 20 years, and
Feng Shui consultant for 10.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
How did those two
blend together?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that I
incorporate mainstream

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, as far as Feng Shui,
with a very unique intuitive

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
aspect, being able to
really sense an environment,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:90%
feel the energetics behind it.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, some people don't know
what either I Ching or Feng

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Shui mean.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:10%
I know we're talking about
them more in our society.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
But would you define
both of those terms?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I Ching is simply an ancient
oracle text, a book of wisdom,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
composed very, very much the way
parts of the Old Testament are.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you apply hermeneutics
to the exegesis of the I Ching,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
you find bits of folk wisdom,
you find wisdom sayings,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
you find little pieces of
history, you find folk songs.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, in Chinese,
the rhymes--

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:90%
the pattern is a rhyme.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
You find puns.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You find jokes.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
You find-- everything that
you find in the Old Testament,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:90%
you find in the I Ching.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
There are great parallels.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:10%
And my husband was
just telling me today

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:10%
that as they're doing the
excavation of the 3 Gorges Dam,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:10%
they are finding a consistent
level of mud silt, which

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:10%
dates from about the time that
people theorize was the Great

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:10%
Flood.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And so what we're finding
is that there is historical

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:10%
physical evidence, so that
when people say the Bible is

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:10%
literally true, the
Bible is literally true.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds of
archeological discoveries

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:90%
that substantiate that.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, and the Feng Shui--

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and, Abbi, tell us
what is Feng Shui.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think Feng Shui is
really making yourself in tune

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:90%
with your environment.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:90%
We tend to close ourself off.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We build structures that
have walls and fences

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And we alienate our self
with the environment.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to find is a
way of incorporating

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
the environment within our
own small integral group.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So with Feng Shui, you make
that transition more fluid.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And it enhances your
life and the way

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
we perceive things
on a daily basis.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of the things
that bothers me so much about

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
living in Southwest Florida is
we are in paradise and we have

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:84%
built, especially on banks
and businesses, these sealed,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.055 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy, toxic buildings.

00:04:53.055 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And here we--

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is the flow?

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:56.075 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're sitting
in air conditioning,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
looking out at palm trees
instead of sitting under a palm

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.325 align:middle line:84%
tree and enjoying life,
and being one with nature.

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you said you have used
a very practical approach with

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Feng Shui in your
real estate business.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> In my real estate business.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, I knew of Feng
Shui as a branch of Eastern

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, very esoteric
with no practical validity

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
in the late 20th century, until
I got the listing from hell--

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
a house that had been on
the market for two years.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Every realtor in
town had had this.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
winds up in my desk

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sort of the
St. Jude of real estate.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:90%
I take hopeless causes.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And we tried every traditional
marketing technique

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
with his house.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, I said,
oh, what the hell?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's try Feng Shui.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So as the house was
being Fung Shuied--

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and we hired a Feng
Shui consultant

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
enough about it at the time.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in my office,
doing my little real estate

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
The first of three
offers that day--

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --came in on a house that
had been on the market for two

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
years with no offers.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a coincidence.

00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>> There are no coincidences.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> There are no coincidences.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.408 align:middle line:84%
>> We all know there
are no coincidences.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Three offers
in that same day.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's fabulous.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came to Southwest
Florida and began real estate,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there is
a terrible disparity

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
between the very professionally
done new developments, which

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
are so beautifully
packaged to sell,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and people who, in real
life with real homes,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.887 align:middle line:84%
trying to compete with a very
polished, professional product.

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I hadn't thought
about-- like that.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I realized that
we need to repackage houses

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
for the resale market so that
they can compete and there is

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:90%
a certain amount of parity.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, of course,
selling a house

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
has got to be one of the two
most stressful things you

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:90%
can do in your life.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
it with Fung Shui,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
you do it with a kind
of ease and confidence.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
We try to make things just less
stressful for the poor seller.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So is that what the
business will be about,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.755 align:middle line:90%
the design difference?

00:07:18.755 --> 00:07:19.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:90%
The design difference is that.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, of
course, we're really

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
happy to start from
scratch with people.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And I tried--

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>> About planning.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> With planning.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, you start
selling your house--

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
you start marketing
the house the day

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
you signed the
contract to buy it.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I'm a
realtor so that's how--

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how you think.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how I think.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have brought just
wonderful items for us.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
One is St. Therese
of the Child Jesus.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And tell me about
this and Feng Shui.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, St. Therese is
considered to be the Saint

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:10%
of modern times.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:10%
I have a traditional Italian--

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm a good Italian
girl, Catholic girl,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:10%
16 years in Catholic schools,
two years at Brandeis.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, godless Harvard,
including the Divinity School.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I studied at the Law School, the
Business School, the Ed School,

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
the Yard, and the
Divinity School.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:10%
Because if you go to the Ed
School, you can cross-register.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:10%
Anyways, St. Therese
I have great devotion

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:10%
to because she is a mystic.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:10%
And I found late in my
life, when I needed a label,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:10%
that I, too, am a mystic.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I am very devoted to the
practice of centering prayer.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But I also participate in
charismatic Catholicism

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and devotion to the Holy Spirit.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the idea of what
I call our people that I

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
interview often who are
intuitives and so forth like

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
you, Abbi, also,
is modern mystics.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
very comfortable with it

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:90%
as terminology.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But tell us-- we
want to find out

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
a few of these facts
about Feng Shui.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about some
of the beautiful gifts

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.207 align:middle line:84%
that you have brought
us today, and I

00:09:05.207 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:90%
don't know where to begin.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Behind us here we have three
items that you have brought.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And the one in the center--

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.365 align:middle line:84%
because of where I placed it,
I put it in the fame section.

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me about what
that is and why that's

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%
the fame part of our set.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the plum blossom is
significant in when you just

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
look at it-- the beautiful
beauty of the blossoming

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:90%
fruit--

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
the up and coming fruit.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's for prosperity.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So by placing it
in your fame area,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
it will bring you prosperity
in that aspect of your life.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.415 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
you're enjoying that.

00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you said, how about
if it's in your fame area?

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, fine.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:90%
That works for me.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But we also had so much
fun with one of the things

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
that you brought me that
we're going to talk about.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is the frog.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And we have a little frog.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, he doesn't
have a battery.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
put a battery in--

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> He would make noises.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --and he'll make
noises for you.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, see, I have another
understanding of frogs.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
From the Native American,
it's a cleansing and things.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
if you see a frog

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:90%
the first thing in the morning?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good luck for
the rest of the day.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And prosperity.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:84%
A frog in the kitchen is
wealth, is prosperity.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
So don't chase them out.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Be kind to them.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And the kitchen is
what feeds the home.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the center of the home,
the hearth and everything.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So there are things that
you can do in your kitchen.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:84%
One simple thing is
maybe putting up a mirror

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
behind the stove burners.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that will magnify it
to 8 instead of four burners.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So that will multiply the
abundance of the hearth.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had told you
about the frog,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
that I had found
a little tiny frog

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:90%
in my mailbox the other day.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And you said, oh, good.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Because prosperity, then, would
be coming through the mail.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] So we
have the symbology.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what this is
so much about, the Feng Shui.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to make
sure that people know that

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
if you're a Christian, you
can use Christian symbols.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're Jewish, you
can use Jewish symbols.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:10%
If you're a Muslim--

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:10%
whatever you are, you don't
have to look like a Chinese junk

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:10%
shop to use Feng Shui.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But the symbolism is isn't
necessarily what's behind it.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's those subliminal
messages that we

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:84%
get that makes our
subconscious in line

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
with our conscious mind that
brings fluidity to our lives.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the way
the I Ching works.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
It aligns the conscious
and the subconscious.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And neurolinguistic
programming--

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
when you have that,
you have truth.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:90%
You have instant the aha moment.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] The aha.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to take a
break, aha, and we

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.985 align:middle line:84%
will be right back about more
of I Ching and Feng Shui.

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:01.775 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:12:01.775 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, the book is "I Ching."
and it is by Kerson and Rosemary

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Huang.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And the women are
Abbi and Rosemary,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:90%
and Feng Shui is the concept.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You are consultants, and the
business is Design Difference.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're doing,
and the energy is very high

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and it's very exciting.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you
about the colors.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because color, in Feng Shui, is
so powerful and so important.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:90%
So, Abbi, we've got--

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
you brought me a
beautiful red heart, too.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And along
with the red heart is

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:90%
the power of the energy of red.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Red is very intense.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you see it, it
revs up an emotion in you

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
that's very energetic.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you're look-- let's
say you're a writer or looking

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
for new ideas or
something like that--

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
putting a splash of red in your
office or in your study will

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:84%
help to get that energy
level up and rev that--

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
make your new ideas come
a lot more clear to you.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:90%
It just incites those things.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And here's her red scarf.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And your red jacket.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, the power of purple--

00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and you've been telling me where
I need to place purple around.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We have some behind
us here that you

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
brought with tissue paper
and this beautiful angel.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:84%
What is that the
power of purple?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Purple is an
intensification of red.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the color of
royalty and privilege.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's rich--

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:90%
a richer red than red.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is wealth
or it is prosperity.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So it just
intensifies the red.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It takes it to another level.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.365 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an intensification.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is a paling.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Any variation of
red is luck, wealth,

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's why you had
Chinese restaurants always red

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and gold, always red and gold.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're dressed
in black and gold.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Black and gold.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Black is the symbol
of wealth, and gold--

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty universal.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk to you
about diamonds and crystals.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Because crystals, diamonds--
diamonds, especially--

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:10%
and if you're the real thing,
you can wear imposters.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:10%
One of these is real,
and one of those is fake.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> And nobody--

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>> On your hands?

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody knows the--

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
you can't see.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway--

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> One is real, one is fake.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And no one can tell
the difference.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that a diamond or
any crystal refracts light,

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:90%
creates rainbows.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things I
like to do at those long stop

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
lights in Naples is hold
my rings up to the light

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and throw rainbows
all over my car.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's fun.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:10%
It's fun.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What about green,
the power of green?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:90%
What does it bring to you?

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, green is the fruits
of the Earth, basically.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of
green, automatically it

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
gives you that warm, seasonal,
healthy, healthy, green growing

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So do we have green?

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes we have green
in front of us,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and we have green around us.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is just
healthy and natural.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, it's-- green
is the color of nature.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So God must love
green an awful lot.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And there goes the Irish,
puffing themselves up.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Green, in America, is the color
of money-- green and black.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.385 align:middle line:90%
So green and black for wealth.

00:15:25.385 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I wanted to
touch upon I Ching again,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
because it is an oracle.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And I use the I Ching.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
I have for years.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:10%
I use it as--

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:10%
with great respect, as
if it were an oracle

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:10%
that I was actually
connecting the energy to when

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm in a state of confusion
and want some clarity.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And you were kind enough to
do an I Ching hexagram for me

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:10%
before you came today.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And you found that it was--

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It was number 19 prevailing.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:10%
And the judgment line is
sign at the great sacrifice,

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:10%
suspicious omen.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The main concern
of this hexogram

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is the art of gaining
influence over people.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Here she is on national TV.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The advice is directed toward
a leader of the people,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:90%
in particular the king.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Better call the president, huh?

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Persuasion through honesty and
sincerity is very much favored.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the use of force
is discouraged.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't do that.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But I try to be as
honest as I can.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And your first line is influence
people by persuading them.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And your last line is persuading
must be done with honesty.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you had done,
then, you did a little bit

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:90%
of a mystical--

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
took a mystical moment in time,
and shared some wisdom with me

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to know.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what the I Ching did?

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But you already
knew that, Georgia.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.425 align:middle line:90%
>> But it reinforced.

00:16:47.425 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your business,
Abbi, what is your purpose?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
What did the two of
you plan to accomplish

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%
through Design Difference?

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to give people hope and
help them to align themselves,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:84%
be more centered,
be more in control,

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
and to guide them on a journey
that is prosperous and full

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:90%
of love.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Abbi is a healer.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Abbi's a healer.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.654 align:middle line:90%
I'm an old '60s radical.

00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to change the world,
make it a better place.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I am particularly interested
in organizational development,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
which I studied at Harvard.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm interested in empowering
business organizations

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
so that employees can prosper.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love to shop at Walmart
at 3 o'clock in the morning

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
because all those people are
millionaires, and Home Depot.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
The people who wait on
you are millionaires.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fabulous?

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:10%
>> That is.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that great?

00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:52.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how do you
interpret that?

00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> People who work at the Ritz--

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:84%
somebody said, going
to the Ritz at Naples

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is like going to Heaven because
you're treated so angelically.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that great?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That is.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
You had some words of
wisdom for me about my book,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:90%
and the cover of my book.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I thought
that was fascinating.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.425 align:middle line:84%
>> This book is like being
in a community of masters.

00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You hold that up.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll hold it.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you can tell me what
you found that you thought

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:90%
was-- that I needed to know.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, see how
beautiful her colors are?

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And she has colors of
the higher chakras.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:90%
And she's perfect.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:10%
Here you are at the top chakra--

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:10%
all these blues and
purples and pinks.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
really advanced soul.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:10%
But what she's done here
with this metal belt

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:10%
is to cut off her chi between
her lower chakras, which

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:10%
are the Earth chakras,
the sexual creativity,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:10%
and her higher intuitive
creativity, generativity.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And so she's cut herself in
half with this metal belt.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> So take the belt off.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Just take the belt
off, let it flow.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.115 align:middle line:84%
So you girls basically are
not wearing belts much.

00:19:03.115 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:10%
>> We're not wearing belts.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.905 align:middle line:90%
But we certainly wear jewelry.

00:19:05.905 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and you did mention that
we need to have jewelry on both

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
wrists.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, tell me about that,
too, the jewelry on both wrists.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember
the "Wonder Woman"

00:19:13.932 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:90%
cartoons and how she used to--

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Her metal--

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Her metal bracelet
of gold wrists,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and so she used to deflect evil.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
you want diamonds

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:90%
wherever you can put them.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.767 align:middle line:10%
Because, again, they take in
the rainbows and refract light.

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Refracting light.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, and that's good.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
On your business
brochure you have water.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.745 align:middle line:90%
You have the waterfall.

00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know water is one
of the elements that are

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:90%
very important for the flow.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:90%
What about water?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Water is very intense.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can take
a very hard stone

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and make it very
nice and smooth.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very tactile and fluid,
but yet very forceful.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if you put a fountain
in your home or whatever,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that constant flow and the
sound that you're getting

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:90%
helps to relax you.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
But, yet, it's intense and
it helps guide you forward.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And remember, water
is our natural element,

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:84%
since we're conceived
in amniotic fluid.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Life is generated from the sea.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Water is a symbol of money.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And Feng Shui to me,
in Christian symbology,

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the presence
of the Holy Spirit.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:10%
In the Old Testament,
whenever there's prophecy,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:10%
you hear about the
surface of the water being

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:10%
rippled by the wind.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah,yes.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So there-- the wind
and the water, Feng Shui,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:90%
the Holy Spirit.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you did also bring
a beautiful little angel.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, a little
mobile that moves around, too.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, tell me about it.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a little Christmas
ornament for your tree.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And we brought this
for you because you're

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:84%
being beamed into space with
the satellites and the angels.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And we wish you great luck in
your TV production and your TV

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And we hope that you'll
be another Oprah.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my nickname, the
Oprah of Southwest Florida.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, why not be Oprah?

00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:01.825 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:21:01.825 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Be Oprah, Oprah.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, also with the flowers
that you brought, too,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
we have that rich red
color with the green.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have introduced
a lot of energy.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel a difference
in the energy that we--

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:90%
that we have on the set.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to talk a little
bit about the businesses

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.315 align:middle line:84%
we've worked with, and how
we have really enhanced

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:23.115 align:middle line:90%
their prosperity--

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
we don't have time.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --and their well-being
for-- oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Just give me a bottom line.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You have enhanced the
prosperity of the businesses

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:90%
with Feng Shui.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Helped them multiply
their assets.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Increase and multiply.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:21:36.335 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And, do you know,
we're out of time.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:90%
That went so fast.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And how wonderful--

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
We should have done an hour.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:90%
We needed it.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Next time.

00:21:43.455 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Bless you both, and
thank you for being with us.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
How wonderful it is when
people have found a way

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to serve others doing
something that is so positive,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.002 align:middle line:84%
that is so supportive, that
is so prosperity enhancing.

00:22:29.002 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
both of these women

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
have done, bringing
their energies together

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.468 align:middle line:84%
with Feng Shui on
a basis of I Ching.

00:22:35.468 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:90%
We thank you for being with us.
