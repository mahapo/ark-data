00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.700 align:middle line:10%
And I want to welcome you
to our healing series.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.780 align:middle line:10%
We are going to be talking
with you about an understanding

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle line:10%
of illness and disease.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be talking
about a medical intuitive who

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:10%
can help you become more
intuitive about your own body.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Come join us today, "Living
In Balance" on Shakti-Hill.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Patti Conklin will share her
wisdom and her light with us

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.737 align:middle line:10%
And she is a medical intuitive.

00:00:52.737 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:90%
And I want to welcome you.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
- Thank you so much
for having me today.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Healing Within is the
workshop that you teach.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be teaching
people how to heal themselves.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually
give them techniques today.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a major issue
with all human beings.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
We really have to get
a better understanding

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of illness and disease.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Don't we?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:10%
When our body starts to act up,
we immediately go into fear.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And so many times, it's our
body just saying wait a minute.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
There's something buried
in here that I really

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
need to let go of in
order to be truly healthy.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at all illness
and disease as an event that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
will begin an emotional,
psychological,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual event in
order to really turn

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that illness around,
they need to understand

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
what it was that began
the creation of that.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the essence
of what you want people

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:90%
to understand first.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
They can go back to a specific
time, a specific event.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
It could be, you said,
psychological, it

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:10%
could be emotional,
it could be spiritual?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It could be spiritual.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be something that they
brought with them as a life

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
learning lesson.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So many times we
see it in children

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.978 align:middle line:84%
that are born with diseases
and at such a very young age.

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know they
haven't stuffed something

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, it doesn't need
to be a traumatic event.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many people
think, well, gee, I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that much
trauma in my lifetime.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't need to
be a traumatic event.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be an
event where you began

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%
to stuff a feeling, an emotion.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, give me
an example of that.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, what might someone do,
like what kind of a thing might

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
they just suppress or
stuff or hold in that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
could later create this disease?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Say you're two years old.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:10%
And you're really
upset with your mother

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:10%
because she won't
give you a cookie.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.165 align:middle line:10%
And you really wanted
something to eat.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:10%
And so you go running
through the house

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:10%
and run towards your bedroom.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
And you fall.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:90%
And you really hurt your knee.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So many times those
tears and anger

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
will go right down
into the knee.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There are specific
places in the body

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:90%
that we tend to carry things.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
However, we'll also go to
the weakest part of the body.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
If there's an event, if
we're born with weak lungs,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency
to put the emotion

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
or event in the weak lungs.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:10%
So then later, you
could have a knee issue.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:10%
You could have, like,
a torn ligament.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:10%
You could have any event.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:10%
Again, you could have a symptom.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:90%
The same thing with the lungs--

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
If that's where
you're vulnerable?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The best story that was so
simplistic for this gentleman.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
He had come to see me.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And he had severe leg pain,
outer thigh on his right leg.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And he had CAT scans
and all the testing.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
find anything wrong.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:90%
But he could barely walk.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he came in
and I looked at him

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
and I said, when did this start?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And he said about a month ago.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what happened to you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:90%
when you were about four?

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:90%
What was a major event?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, I don't know.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And we started talking.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it was an
event with your father.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And his father,
who rarely drank,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
had gotten drunk
one night and gotten

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:90%
in a fight with his mother.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And this four-year-old is
sitting out on the front porch.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And the father came out the
door and was so enraged,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
kicked him in the leg, and
said, get out of my way.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something he
held on to because it never

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
happened again.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.325 align:middle line:84%
But the month prior
to coming to see me,

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
he had gotten in a
fight with his wife.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And he slammed out
the front door.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And the dog was laying there.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And he kicked the dog and
said get out of my way.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And that event
triggered the event that

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
had been buried in his body.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And the body was
just responding,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
it's time to get
this out of here now.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:90%
But the CAT scan didn't find it.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:10%
How did you come up with the
4-year-old and the something

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:10%
to do with dad?

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Now what was that analysis
or diagnosis from you?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, since so much
of the time, you know,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
energy stored in the
body, it's all around us.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's in the chair.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It's what we exist with.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it's just a
matter of actually reading

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if an individual
has anger in their liver,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll just look at their
liver and the word anger

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%
will be written.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll actually
be a movie camera

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
playing inside their body
showing me a specific event.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, age five to
32 was more perception.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I could perceive what
was taking place.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I could feel--

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I had a knowing of where people
were having aches and pains.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And then 1990 was
when I gained sight.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time I actually

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
looked inside of
the body and saw

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the heart beating and
the arteries moving

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.382 align:middle line:84%
and the lungs and the
kidneys and so forth.

00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:39.182 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So you started from
the time you were five,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
you felt what was going
on with other people?

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, yeah.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And you would hear things, too?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I would hear.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I would feel a very
strong perception.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:10%
If I was in the grocery
store walking by someone

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:10%
and my kidney would
start to ache,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:10%
or I could just kind of look
at their body, just physically

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:10%
looking, and my
hand would just want

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:10%
to go right to that
area of their body,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:10%
you know, just to
ease up that pain.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
through life

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to really utilize
that with people

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and see what was taking place.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But then you added
the visual aspect to it.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is very unique.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't perceive this.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So you're teaching
others how to do it.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:10%
But was there something
that happened?

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.142 align:middle line:90%
You said, what 1992?

00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> 1990.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> 1990.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:90%
That added the visual aspect?

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I just had a dream.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And during the
dream, I just heard

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
God's voice say now it's
time for you to fully begin

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:90%
walking your path.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke
up in the morning

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and rolled over to my husband,
I just went into hysteria.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Because I couldn't see his skin.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I could see his heart.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the blood
flowing through his body,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and the kidneys, and so forth.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was very frightened
and jumped out of bed

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and went tearing outside.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And a little bird flew
up to the bird feeder.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the bird, and
I couldn't see any feathers.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And I could just see the
heart and the arteries.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.353 align:middle line:84%
And so all day long
that took place.

00:07:14.353 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I finally, at the end
of the day, said you know,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm more than willing to
do your work, Creator.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But you need to give me
an on and off switch.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Because morally and
ethically, I also

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel it was
appropriate to look at someone

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:90%
without their permission.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, that must have
been absolutely startling.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:10%
Even though the dream had
gotten you open to something

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:10%
new was going to happen.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I wasn't expecting that.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So then you felt
this is your path.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
this is a gift

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that the average
person doesn't have.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you do with that?

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you heal with
this information,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
with this visual that you get?

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:10%
For example, we
talked about the man

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:10%
that you took him
back to an incident.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Now does that work enough
to just know the event?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Does something
automatically happen?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Usually.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe that memory is
stored at a cellular level.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That our brain isn't
just up in our head,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's within the
individual cells of the body.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we have an event
that triggers and moves

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
into the body, it's important
to begin a vibration movement

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
through the body with the
intent to release that memory.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And so I walk them through
a series of exercises

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:10%
that we can do to
really begin focusing

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:10%
on releasing that event.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's really important if
you're working with cancer,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:10%
if you're working with
fibromyalgia, any of those.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And so are you as effective
with something in helping

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:10%
someone do self-healing with,
like, for example, cancer.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:10%
Is this as easy for you to
help them work in self-healing

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:10%
as the man's outer thigh was?

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe in homework.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:90%
I believe in self-empowerment.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so my rule of thumb is I'll
work with someone three times.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show them where
stuff is stored in their body.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll give them the tools
to begin releasing it.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, it's
their responsibility

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to continue the work after
they're working with me.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
80% of my work is
done over the phone.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to have
a client with me.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we begin moving that
vibration through their body.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And I give them the technique.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
We just really look at
where they've stored.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lady in
San Francisco who,

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
when she came to me
at age 38 last summer,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
she had breast cancer, uterine
cancer, bone cancer, and now

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
lung cancer.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And was definitely looking
at some real major issues,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
some real major anger.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:10%
>> And she's also had severe
asthma since she was six.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we spent
three days together

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
in intensive work of moving
that anger and all of the issues

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
out of her body.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And within a week,
her CAT scan started

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
showing that the lesions,
the cancerous lesions

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:90%
were starting to disappear.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
The day we stopped working, her
asthma completely went away.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't taken any
medication since.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
And she's really living in joy.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is amazing.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:10%
But it's also that
person is self-healing.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Because you don't do it.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Although you have
a gift to help them.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.662 align:middle line:10%
But that you actually are
empowering other people trying

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:10%
to move towards self-healing.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in doing it.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.807 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that that's
why I was given my gift.

00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's my
focus to really help

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
them understand how what they
think is truly what they are.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And if they begin thinking
negative thoughts,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that they're really just
putting it in their own body.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.915 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think that's very
important which you just said,

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:10%
what they think.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's the negative thinking.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:10%
>> So you really have to
move people out of that, too.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It not only just brings along a
healing effect within the body.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It begins behavioral changes.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, there doesn't
have to be any negative.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:90%
It's how we perceive it.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It's how we think.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we choose to have that
negative connotation, we will.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So our response to what
happens is what is really what

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:10%
is key in all of this.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:10%
Well, I love what
you're going to do

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.650 align:middle line:10%
for us in the next segment.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.275 align:middle line:10%
Because you're going
to do some of this

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:10%
process so that you can
teach me and our audience

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:10%
how they can move through
this to the self-healing.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Excellent.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:10%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:10%
with the medical
intuitive, Patti Conklin.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.867 align:middle line:10%
And we will learn techniques
how we can heal ourselves.

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:10%
We'll be right back.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:10%
>> If you are just joining
us, Patti Conklin is our guest

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:10%
And she is part of
our healing series.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking
about healing within.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And Patti is a
medical intuitive.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We can become, maybe not
to the degree that you are,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but we can become
more intuitive in how

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:90%
we understand our bodies.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can
teach us to do that.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we recognize
these blocked energies?

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
How do we recognize the
problems that we have?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you were training us?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in so many instances,
people will already have pain

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:10%
But if they don't, if they
say, gee, I feel pretty good,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:10%
and nothing really
hurts, then I'd

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:10%
ask them to just take a
nice, centering breath,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:10%
put a beautiful white
cocoon around them,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:10%
and ask their body where any
negative energy is stored

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:10%
that they need to move out.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:10%
And they may begin to feel a
heaviness, or a tightening.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:10%
The most important thing
is to trust your body.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Your body has all the
information and knowledge

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll ever need
stored inside of it--

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
not just about your health,
but about everything.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And different people will
understand this in different

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:10%
ways.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Like you said, they
could feel a heaviness.

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you already are
working with that little voice

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
within--

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:90%
You're going to hear it audio.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:90%
You're going to hear it audio.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But you want us to
pay attention to it.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to
pay attention to it.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.538 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're feeling it,
whether you're hearing it,

00:13:01.538 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
whether you're getting symbols,
whether you're getting visions,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like you
to pay attention

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:90%
to what the body is saying.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, you may be
working with chronic fatigue.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And it may be your immune
system needs to be rebuilt.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's going deep
within to the divine spark

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and bringing forward and
building a new immune system.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.585 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be that
you've had cancer.

00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:90%
And it went into remission.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And you think you're fine.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't done the work
inside to truly find out

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
what created that
event, chances are

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
very good something else
will develop in your life.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's
a very key point also.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:10%
Because I've heard
that from many healers.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand
what was the source.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Because often there's
something in your life you have

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:10%
to change.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Or once you have
that awareness.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:10%
But you have to get back
to why did this happen.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:10%
So you need to know that.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:90%
What is our next step?

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:10%
The next step-- as people
are surrounding themselves

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:10%
in a beautiful white
cocoon, I'd like

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:10%
them to just ask their
body to give them

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:10%
a response that would indicate
it was saying yes, just

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:10%
a simple yes.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And they may feel a butterfly
somewhere, a smile somewhere,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:10%
or just a light feeling
taking place in their body.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Trust that signal that
your body's saying yes.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Then they can ask
their body to give

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
a response that's saying no.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And usually it's a strong
tightening or a sick feeling

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
in the pit of your
stomach, something

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:90%
the body's indicating saying no.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Then they can begin asking
their body, you know, body,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:90%
are you feeling OK today?

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, my kidney
feels kind of tight.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you need some work?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.197 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get a yes or
a no from that kidney.

00:14:40.197 --> 00:14:41.530 align:middle line:90%
You'll get a yes or no response.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Even as you said that, when
you said the light part,

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I did feel light.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
said find with the yes.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
said find the no,

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I did feel kind of
a sinking feeling.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:10%
And I also felt even, like,
a little upset with it.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the
kind of thing again.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the body.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Ask and then listen.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.870 align:middle line:10%
>> And trust.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And trust.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And trust.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Have faith that it's responding.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So then what I do, if
I have a specific area,

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
say you've been having
fertility issues

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and you'd like to
become pregnant.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And nothing's worked.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And you really want to get
those ovaries stimulated.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd close your
eyes and say, body,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
what color does this
cocoon need to be in order

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:90%
to stimulate the ovaries?

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And come with the first
color that comes up.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And the color is not going to
have an emotion attached to it.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just a vibration.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:90%
If black comes up, that's fine.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like them to just
start taking deep breaths

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
in through their nose.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Bring it up through the bottom
of their feet, up their body,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and exhale it out their mouth,
as though they were blowing out

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
a small candle, nice,
slow, deep breaths.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:90%
The color is going to change.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.402 align:middle line:84%
And keep that exercise up
for about five minutes.

00:15:47.402 --> 00:15:48.202 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually
then breathing deeply.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Breathing deeply.

00:15:50.773 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And we're pulling--

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> A color.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --a color.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That the body wants.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> The body wants.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And you said why will it change?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:90%
It just does?

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Because as the vibration
is shaking loose that negative

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
energy, it needs
different vibrations.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the color is going to
shift as they're doing it.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'd rather they
not put any emotional status

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
to the color.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just
looking for a vibration.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
If I told you to run 1,000
megahertz through your body,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't understand
what I wanted.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:90%
The body wouldn't say.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%
The body wouldn't know.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But if I asked you to run
orange through your body,

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.503 align:middle line:90%
your body can respond to orange.

00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:10%
So they're going to work with
those colors for five or six

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:10%
minutes, until the body
either takes the color back

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:10%
to white itself, or after
five or six minutes you

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:10%
take it back to white.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is so important that
you begin breathing white

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.657 align:middle line:10%
through your body.

00:16:39.657 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
this is the time

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I like people to do their
positive affirmations.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:10%
Because once you've taken
a negative piece of energy

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:10%
out of a cell, your cell wants
to replicate in perfect order.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't put something
else in it to replace it,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:10%
it will replicate
the negative again.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:10%
So for example when you said
that, I got the color red.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And then as you said to bring it
through it started to be pink.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Now I was doing that
very fast action.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> But you would actually
want me to move from the red

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to the white.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
going through that--

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
>> --just like this.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Take five minutes.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Take five minutes.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.252 align:middle line:10%
>> But you want to
get back to white,

00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:10%
because white means that
you have processed it.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.399 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:10%
That you're moving into a
healing and cleansing area.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So what I suggest they
say is to your body.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Say body, I love
you unconditionally.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:90%
I accept you fully.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
being clear and healthy.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Because your body will
do exactly what you ask.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you're worried
about being ill,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.527 align:middle line:84%
and that's all you
think about, the body

00:17:35.527 --> 00:17:37.569 align:middle line:84%
is not discerning that
you don't want to be sick.

00:17:37.569 --> 00:17:39.819 align:middle line:84%
It's just saying, oh, we're
thinking about being sick,

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be sick.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.497 align:middle line:84%
And so we put positive
affirmations in.

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's good for
someone if they've

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:90%
got real low self-esteem.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that
affirmation for us again?

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Body, I love you
unconditionally.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I accept you fully.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
being clear and healthy.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if you don't
believe it up in your mind.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the intent going down into
the cellular structure that's

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
have problems saying that.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:10%
After they get done with that
process of being in the white,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:10%
then I like them to balance
their chakra system back out.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:10%
So I'll say, what
color do you need

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.267 align:middle line:10%
to fully balance your chakras?

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they'll get a rainbow.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they'll get two
or three different colors.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:10%
And I have them,
then, breathe it

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.615 align:middle line:10%
in through the bottom of
their feet, up their body,

00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:10%
and out their crown chakra,
just for one minute.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And that just balances
everything back out.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, you've
shifted your energy system

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And so all your chakras
are out of alignment

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%
when you do something like that.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you believe that our
chakra system has to come back

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to balance.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's the next step.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So not only have we
created this white cocoon,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
but now we may have thrown
something out of balance--

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> --in working with the color.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Within our body.

00:18:48.852 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> So whatever your body says
is the color you need through

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.143 align:middle line:10%
your chakra, again, it
comes up and through.

00:18:53.143 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it
could be a rainbow.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:84%
One little boy got a
visualization of pink triangles

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.118 align:middle line:90%
with yellow spots inside of it.

00:19:02.118 --> 00:19:03.535 align:middle line:84%
>> It doesn't
matter what you get.

00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:90%
That was his vibration.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Then have we balanced
and are we back?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> We balanced.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And we're back.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And it normally takes
about 10 minutes a day.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:10%
>> And what I suggest with
individuals is as they start

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:10%
the process, to
do it twice a day.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And then continue once a day
for the rest of your life.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Because you're worth 12 minutes.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now take us
through those steps.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Because they're very simple.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:10%
If you'll just reiterate
those, that would be good.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.265 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
start out putting

00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:10%
a beautiful white
cocoon around yourself.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:10%
And that can come
from source, God,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:10%
whatever your belief system
is to surround your body.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Ask your body what
color it needs

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:10%
to do the specific job that
you're asking it to do.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Be literal with your body.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're working on a
kidney, say you have a kidney

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
infection, what color do I need
to remove the kidney infection?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:10%
Breathe that color through
for five or six minutes,

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:10%
and it will change colors, the
very colors that come through.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Then move to a
white light again.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And breathe through the healing
and cleansing white light.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Give your body
positive affirmations.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Body, I love you
unconditionally.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I accept you fully.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
being clear and healthy.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.115 align:middle line:84%
And then move into what colors
do I need to fully balance.

00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to bring those
through the bottom of your feet

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and out your crown chakra.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And just do--

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Just for one minute.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's a nice, nice
thing to do for your body.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a nice thing
to do for your body.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And it just moves such a
tremendous amount of energy

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
What people are surprised about
is if they do a real heavy

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
session over the phone with me--
it takes about an hour when we

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:90%
do it over the phone--

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%
they're exhausted afterwards.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
When you move that kind of
energy through your body

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and release that kind of
energy, it's very tiring.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And some people
will find that they

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:90%
become very toxic the next day.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:90%
That their body--

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, really works.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you have a couple
of books that you'd like

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:90%
to recommend.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
your own book that

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:90%
will be released very soon.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And your own book is going
to be called "God Within."

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> "God Within."

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.642 align:middle line:90%
>> "Utilizing the Divine Spark."

00:20:59.642 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
One of your favorites also,
that you highly recommend,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:90%
is "The Anatomy of The Spirit."

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> By Dr. Caroline Myss.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And this also has
the same philosophy

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of healing that you
have worked with?

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.653 align:middle line:84%
>> You also mentioned another
one that you liked so well

00:21:16.653 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:90%
by Doreen Virtue.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Doreen Virtue, "The
Lightworker's Way."

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And basically, that's just a
wonderful tale of Doreen's life

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and how she really started
moving into her gifts

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and really opening up
the light in everyone.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I love this.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.208 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
something that we can do.

00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:35.373 align:middle line:90%
And I feel good about it.

00:21:35.373 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
you have taken us

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:10%
through a process
of self-healing.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:10%
And I love to empower people.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:10%
Because we need to
take back that power.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It doesn't have
to be difficult.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's the
most surprising thing.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
People will come for
individual sessions.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And one lady said, you
know, I really feel guilty.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in pain.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in panic.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in agony.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This is just a really
loving way to release it.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And it is.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And bless you for being such
a loving medical intuitive.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you would like to be in
touch with us and also with

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:90%

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:10%
Illness and disease
are not natural to us

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:10%
when it does occur, we need to
work on our own self-healing.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.792 align:middle line:10%
And we can.

00:22:47.792 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:10%
We can heal within.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:10%
And thank Patti Conklin
for sharing one more way

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:10%
that we can become
more medically

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:10%
intuitive to our own bodies so
that we may live in balance.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being with
us on Shakti-Hill today.
