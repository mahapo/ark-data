00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I want to invite you

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.340 align:middle line:90%
to join us today on a journey.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be going on
an invisible path to success.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Our guide will be the author
of the book Robert Scheinfeld.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:84%
So come join us,
"Living in Balance."

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm Shakti-Hill,
and we will take

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.348 align:middle line:84%
a journey on the
invisible path to success.

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:24.834 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Just the word success might
enthrall us and invite us.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
I was reading the introduction
to the book by Bob Scheinfeld,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:10%
and I really liked it.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:10%
It just sounded so intriguing.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:10%
And the invisible path,
that's the exciting part,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:10%
to find out why is it invisible
and what does that mean?

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:10%
He said the definitions
are new, so we

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:10%
have Bob to explain this to us.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to be here.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The invisible
path to success.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.555 align:middle line:90%
That's a great title.

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.892 align:middle line:84%
But tell me, I don't
know what that means.

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, people
are always saying--

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's a big
term in computers--

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:90%
what you see is what you get.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.045 align:middle line:84%
>> It's actually what you don't
see is what you get in life.

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
that there are

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
what I call unseen forces
that shape our lives.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And my book shows
people how to understand

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
what those forces are
and how to better manage

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:84%
them to go about getting
what you really want in life.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are seven steps
that you take people through

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
to manage those unseen--

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Those unseen forces, yeah.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, also you said you
had an audience that you kind

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:90%
of targeted with this book.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think is going to
be choosing this book to read,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.007 align:middle line:84%
and why did you want to target
this particular audience?

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there are
more and more people that are

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
starting to ask what I call
the most important questions

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Who am I?

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:10%
Why am I here?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:10%
What is my life purpose?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.875 align:middle line:84%
What really causes what
happens to me every day?

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
something I really

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.223 align:middle line:84%
want, how do I really
go about getting it?

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
How do I get from here to
where I really want to be?

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're frustrated by
the traditional answers,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
for new answers.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to offer
some different answers

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
based on some experiences
I had with my life

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
falling apart using the
traditional self-help

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
techniques to try
and change things,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:84%
finding they didn't work,
needing to find something

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that worked because my
life was a real mess.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:90%
It was falling apart.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And coming up with some
answers that worked for me,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and I found it worked
for other people as well.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I like about
that is that it's always--

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if it's out
of the need that we come

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:90%
to the answers.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a need in
your life to figure out what

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
you had to do next.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a few
graphics that we're

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.438 align:middle line:84%
going to bring up that
come from your book.

00:02:43.438 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:10%
The first one that I
wanted you to explain,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:10%
and you said that
you're going to be

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:10%
looking at this differently.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And these are the seven steps
to understanding and managing

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:10%
the unseen forces
shaping your life.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH] That's what
we're learning here.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.205 align:middle line:10%
And the first one is
about the director.

00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And you said you're
going to be looking

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
at the director of your life
maybe differently than most

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.585 align:middle line:90%
people would define that.

00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when you go to a movie,
you see a lot of action up

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
You see actors, and
you see actresses,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:90%
and you see special effects.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
What you're not aware of is
the director of the movie, who

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
coached those actors and
actresses, paced the movie,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
made decisions about what's
going to happen where

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.618 align:middle line:84%
and what order, how are we
going to communicate and explore

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
this whole idea that
the movie is about.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
is true in our lives.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We all come into life wanting
to explore or experience or do

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.768 align:middle line:84%
something, just
like somebody who

00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
makes a movie because there's
an idea or a theme or something

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.968 align:middle line:90%
they want to explore.

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the movie, the
director of the movie

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
manages all the details
from behind the scenes

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
with a crew to make sure
that that movie gets made.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
There is another part
of our consciousness

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
that I compare to the director
of the movie, who we're here

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
playing and having the
experience, and this part of us

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
is behind us managing
all the details for us

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we get what
I call the total immersion

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
movie experience
we came here for.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so it isn't
separate from us.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of us,
and it's the director

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
who is a part of us who
is directing our life.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.905 align:middle line:84%
Is that how you're
explaining this?

00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's another part of us that
takes over the responsibility

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.737 align:middle line:90%
for managing.

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
The way I explain it is you
look at a very famous actor

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:90%
like Tom Hanks.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Tom Hanks is a real person.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:90%
He's got a real life.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:90%
He does things.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But when he's onstage,
he temporarily

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
leaves who he really is behind.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:90%
He takes on another persona.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:90%
He has this experience.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And when it's over, he goes
back to his regular life.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a part of
us that comes down here,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.060 align:middle line:84%
has this total immersion
movie experience.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And the real us, if you
will, stays behind the scenes

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and manages all the
details to make sure

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
we get the experience we want.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so we are the
director of our movie.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I like that.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Now you said--

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.622 align:middle line:84%
>> But the conscious
part of us isn't.

00:04:52.622 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> The conscious part is not.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The conscious part
is not running the show.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the big messages
in the book that's different.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.427 align:middle line:90%
This director part of us is.

00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
have found of people who are

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
on the spiritual path
and they are aware of it,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
they are in search of
that purpose in life.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you put it, it's
discovering your true self

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and your true life's purpose.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is really why
we're here, is it not?

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a big deal for you
to explain to your reader.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:90%
How would you explain this?

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
How does someone find their
true self and their true life's

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:90%
purpose?

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me
ask you a question.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.135 align:middle line:84%
What is something in life that
you just absolutely love to do?

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's what
I'm doing right now.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.235 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so doing interviews?

00:05:34.235 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I love it, yes.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:10%
What about it is
it that you love?

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I love to get that
information, and it's exciting,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:10%
especially when I'm interviewing
somebody who's sharing

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:10%
something that they've
found to be profound,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:10%
and they can't wait to
share it with other people.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's exciting to you?

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love it, yeah.

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:55.206 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, excitement to me is what
I call an inner experience.

00:05:55.206 --> 00:05:56.006 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, everything
that we do in life,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
everything that we love to do,
whether it's horseback riding,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
or it's interviewing, or
it's going to a movie,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
or it's skating, or it's
singing, or listening to music,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
anything you could ask
somebody that they love to do,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:84%
what it's really about is
what's going on inside of us.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're thinking,
it's what we're feeling,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's how we're growing.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the internal experience.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all that matters.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's out
on the screen of a movie

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
is all designed to impact
your internal experiences.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do
in life is designed

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to impact your
internal experiences.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So to me, we all come into
life interested in exploring

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
a particular group
of inner experiences.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.978 align:middle line:84%
And we create this
whole movie script

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and have the actors
and the actresses

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and have all these things
that happen in our lives

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate those inner
experiences that we're

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:90%
really interested in.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
single life purpose.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.477 align:middle line:84%
We all come in here to
explore these different inner

00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:90%
experiences and interests.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.518 align:middle line:90%
And it can be anything.

00:06:48.518 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be something
from being a mother of twins,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to being a doctor, to
being a spy behind enemy

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:84%
lines in a war, to helping
to share personal growth

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.817 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is interested
in something different.

00:07:00.817 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but how we find that--
how we know we're in it is when

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:84%
it's so exciting, it's the
excitement that we feel,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that inner excitement, then
we are kind of in that groove.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.082 align:middle line:84%
How do we know if
we are doing it?

00:07:14.082 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, to
me, you're always doing it.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether you know of
it consciously or not,

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.735 align:middle line:84%
this director part of you is
making sure that you're staying

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
on track and that everything
is moving the way it's meant

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.402 align:middle line:84%
to move, and you're going to
have the movie experience,

00:07:25.402 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:90%
the lifetime you came here for.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So you're always on track,
whether you feel it or not.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
I know lots of times we don't,
but to me the truth is you are.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about what's
going on inside of you,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
not what's going
on outside of you.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So that exhilaration that
we feel standing on the edge

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Gulf of Mexico and
looking out at the sunset,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%
then that's just one of those
moments that we have that's one

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons why we're here is
to experience this world, too?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Can it be just that
simple of experience?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>> To me it's just that simple.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Did you see the movie
"City of Angels"?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You have this angel who,
at least the way the movie was

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:84%
portrayed, didn't
have any feelings,

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any
inner experience,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
was just kind of
there and observing,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and was so desperate
to have those things,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
from tasting fruit to
touching another human being,

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:90%
all of the inner experiences.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it's
about down here.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:90%
That's why we came.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.462 align:middle line:84%
To explore and to play and to
have these inner experiences,

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that's what the
whole game's about.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
How to define what success
means to you and achieve it.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:90%
You move us through that.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So success is not the same
definition for each person,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Success, to me, is having
the total immersion movie

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
experience you came here for.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Exploring what you
wanted to explore,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.418 align:middle line:84%
experiencing what you
want to experience,

00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and doing what you wanted
to do, whatever it is.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.663 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not about getting rich.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not about getting famous.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
a great parent.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not about enlightenment
or becoming a master

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and ascending, which to me, a
lot of this spiritual growth,

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.133 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about it,
it's about exploring

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:90%
what you want to explore.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I look at this
planet as if it was

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.688 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional amusement
park where total immersion

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
movies are filmed, and you can
play with any inner experience

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But the total
immersion, we're in it.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
We're right in the
middle of all of this.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
What if people are feeling
they are not successful,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
they are not achieving,
their life isn't working,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and by anyone's standard
they're not successful?

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They're in the movie, so what
is different about someone who's

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
feeling like they're
not playing in this game

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're not feeling
any of the positives?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to me, it's not
always about positives.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, even if you or I
can't identify with it,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
couldn't understand
why anybody would ever

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
want to explore a
particular reality,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
everybody is fascinated
with everything.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the kind
of movies that are made,

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
the books that are written,
the stories that rivet us

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
when we're reading
the newspaper,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
we're all fascinated
by everything.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:84%
The so-called good and
bad, dark and evil.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.018 align:middle line:90%
We're interested [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Some people are more interested
in really deeply exploring it

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.643 align:middle line:84%
at a very deeper
level than others.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But the question
that you asked, I

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.477 align:middle line:84%
guess I'd answer
in a couple ways.

00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:84%
One, have you ever been in a
movie that was two hours long,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and at the 40-minute point,
one of the characters

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:90%
was in really deep stuff?

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But by the end of the movie--
and I'm not just talking about

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the old Hollywood
happy ending stuff.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Even today when
it's more realistic,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.235 align:middle line:84%
it was very different an
hour and a half later.

00:10:21.235 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So for some of these people who
feel like they're not a success

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.985 align:middle line:84%
and their life isn't going
the way they're wanting,

00:10:25.985 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say you're just in
one scene in a movie that's

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
got a lot more scenes.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's going to end up somewhere
totally different than where

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:90%
it is now.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And just because of how you feel
about where you are right now

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily
accurate about what

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:90%
the whole production is about.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.387 align:middle line:84%
It's just that one set
of scenes at one point

00:10:41.387 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
in a movie that's
going to run longer.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:10%
>> And you want us to accept
where we are and that we are

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:10%
successful because we're just
being here and experiencing

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:10%
our life.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:90%
We have achieved to a level.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's OK--

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --whatever we are doing.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just fine, exactly,
with what's going on.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I came to a lot of
the realizations that

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
are in the book
because for 31 years,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:90%
life came pretty easily to me.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my father used
to call me Lucky Pierre.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I had
seven years of Murphy's law,

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:90%
where what could go wrong did.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything fell apart.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
I'm the same guy.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm making decisions
the same way.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Why am I getting this
dramatically different result,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and everything I touch
is getting messed up when

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:90%
everything I touched in that--

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I was really desperate,
and I was not happy,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to change things.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But now I look back, and I see
that each one of those scenes

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
was perfectly orchestrated
to get me to a place

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:90%
now that I'm really happy with.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is wisdom and
light you're sharing with us.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.778 align:middle line:84%
If you'll stay tuned,
we'll be right back

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
with more of those
seven steps that

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.682 align:middle line:84%
will take you on this
invisible path to success.

00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:10%
If you are just
joining us, we're

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:10%
talking to Robert
Scheinfeld, and he

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:10%
has written a book called "The
Invisible Path to Success."

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And we've been talking about
some of these definitions

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that he's looking at a
little bit differently.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
you talk about in this

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is that your life is you
make the analogy a little bit

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And you need to
put those pieces in.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The pieces are all
there, but you just

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.055 align:middle line:90%
haven't placed them correctly.

00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:18.187 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not that you haven't
placed them correctly.

00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you're given
little bits and pieces

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.825 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
your life's over,

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
you've been given
all the pieces.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They've all been put together,
and there's a big picture.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
sometimes we don't even

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
know what's coming
about because we don't

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.063 align:middle line:90%
have all those pieces yet.

00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:32.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:32.863 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, go back to
the analogy of the movie.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Would you enjoy a movie as much
if you knew everything that

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:90%
was going to happen in advance?

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.665 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:39.665 --> 00:12:40.465 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Part of enjoying a movie or
anything that you go to do

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:90%
is the not knowing.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the mystery of
it and the surprise.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you said you were
going to be looking at this from

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
a metaphysical perspective a
little bit differently than

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the people who had been
on a spiritual path have done.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at traditional
self-help and metaphysics from

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
my perspective, the
words are different,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:84%
but the message is pretty
much always the same.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:10%
And the message is you
have unlimited power.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can create anything
you consciously want,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the important
operator here,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.302 align:middle line:90%
if you just use this technique.

00:13:13.302 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
The techniques are
different, but to me, that's

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:90%
the common message.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just found in my
own experience, both

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
when I went through this
down, and being a trainer,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and working with thousands of
people, that just isn't true.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
is, again, we all

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
come into life wanting to
explore something specific.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.087 align:middle line:84%
And the filter that determines
what's going to happen to us

00:13:33.087 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and what's not, what we're
going to get, what we're not,

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
how things are going to flow, is
what we came here to experience

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and how we wanted to,
not what we consciously

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.535 align:middle line:84%
think we want in any
given moment in time.

00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's the
director part of you

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that's really running
the show and making

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the decisions on
what's going to happen,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.655 align:middle line:90%
what's not going to happen.

00:13:50.655 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What goals that you set are you
going to get and you're not.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're going to
get this or not get that.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's going to happen
today or 400 years from now.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.492 align:middle line:84%
It's the director part of
you making the decisions, not

00:13:59.492 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:90%
the conscious self.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well this sounds, then,
like you are really on the side

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of destiny, and that jigsaw
puzzle analogy is that

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:90%
the puzzle is already done.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
We just don't see the pieces.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think some people come
in, and their lives are pretty

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
predestined, and most of
it's been planned in advance.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.652 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
other people that

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
have an idea that they
want to come in and play

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:90%
with a specific kind of a theme.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to be in the
healing business.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a doctor, or I
want to be in the military,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:90%
or I want to be in politics.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't so specific.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be the president
of United States when I'm 36,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do
this and this and this

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and this and this.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:90%
It's general.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And they figure, I'm
going to get in there,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.122 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to make it up as
I go along when I get there.

00:14:42.122 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with movies.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.947 align:middle line:84%
There are some movies that start
out with a 600-page script,

00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and the shoot goes, and
everything is filmed

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:90%
exactly the way the script is.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are other things
where they have a script

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and they get into the
production, everything changes.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:90%
People have new ideas.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Somebody does
something randomly.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:90%
They try something.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
we all come in here

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
intending to explore something.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The degree to which
it's specifically

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
planned and destined is unique.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people very planned, other
people very open, and everybody

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere in between.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
you talk about are the unseen

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
forces or the hidden forces.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And we have a graphic on that.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
What are the unseen forces
that are at play here

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
in this movie of ours?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There are actually
four of them.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And they consist of this
director part of you

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:84%
who's managing all the details
from behind the scenes,

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and the tools, if you will,
that this director uses.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what I think
is the most potent of the four.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.598 align:middle line:84%
The internet is becoming
very powerful in our society.

00:15:36.598 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows about it.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's using it.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
There is actually another
network that connects all of us

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
together at the unconscious
level that's much bigger.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.243 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
powerful, and you don't

00:15:46.243 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
need a computer to access it.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's this network
that connects every living

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
thing on the planet together.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's
this network that

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.752 align:middle line:84%
runs the show of
what's happening

00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:90%
in our lives every day.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And I compare it to placing
classified ads in a newspaper

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
or sending emails
on the internet.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
That all day long, we
are sending messages

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
into this network
asking for what we want

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and offering to give
what we want to give.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And these messages
flash back and forth.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the unconscious level,
these directors and crew parts

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.007 align:middle line:84%
of us behind the
scenes make deals.

00:16:19.007 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this for you
if you do this for us.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.307 align:middle line:84%
And then something
happens up here

00:16:22.307 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in what we call our
daily life, but it's all

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
generated by this
unconscious flow of activity

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
through this
unconscious network.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, now how does
reincarnation fall into this?

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Do we just keep doing this until
we have our favorite movie?

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually there's a
famous quote that's in the book

00:16:39.468 --> 00:16:42.455 align:middle line:84%
that was from Carl Jung, who
said that he had a feeling,

00:16:42.455 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
a very strong feeling
through his whole life--

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
this is Carl Jung-- that
there was some mystery that he

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
stumbled upon in a past life
that was just so rich that he

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
needed a bunch of lives to
be able to explore it fully.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So to me reincarnation
is, just like Tom Hanks,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:84%
in his lifetime,
may do 40 movies,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
where he's doing 40
different things,

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
there's so many things
to do down here.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're fascinated
by all of the options

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that we choose to come
back to play around

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
with some other reality,
either because we're not done

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.167 align:middle line:84%
or because there's
something else to do.

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:15.249 align:middle line:84%
Or you can think about a guy
like Mozart, who pops out

00:17:15.249 --> 00:17:17.803 align:middle line:84%
and as a kid is writing some
of the best music in the world.

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that, yeah,
the four-year-old.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.595 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, that's a series
of lifetimes where he was

00:17:21.595 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
exploring musical composition,
and they culminated in that

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
life because he was fascinated
with that, for whatever reason.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the topics that you
cover here is that decision

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
making process, and we shouldn't
be worrying about the mistakes.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Because there wouldn't be,
then, any mistakes, would there?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:90%
But let's say--

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> By your philosophy.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> No, because by and large,
the director of your movie is

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:90%
so capable of managing details.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But even if something
random happened,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
or you were meant to go
left at a fork in the road

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and you went right
instead, so the director

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
changes a couple of
scenes down the line

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.722 align:middle line:84%
and gets you back
on track again.

00:17:58.722 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that's so
important about that is there

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
was a time in my life when
I was at my most neurotic,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
in any time there was a
big decision making point

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
in my life, I would freeze.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.308 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought,
I have this destiny.

00:18:10.308 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And if I make the
wrong mistake here,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.308 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to trash
the whole thing,

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:14.855 align:middle line:84%
and my life is
going to be ruined.

00:18:14.855 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit
of an exaggeration,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:90%
but I really would get nervous.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And being able to just
relax into the decisions

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.818 align:middle line:84%
and trust that ultimately my
movie's going to get filmed.

00:18:24.818 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get to
experience what I want.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The director is
going to make sure

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
even if I make a mistake, quote
unquote, which I don't think

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
happens that much, it reduces
an enormous amount of stress

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and lets you relax into
what's going on with you

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and trusting this
director part of you

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
instead of being a worried
maniac all the time.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I kind
of wonder about is

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
some people really would
measure their success

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:90%
by their happiness.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And you don't necessarily--

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
it's also just as good to be
totally bummed out because then

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing being
emotionally distressed.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was a study that
was done earlier in the year,

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.123 align:middle line:84%
where they interviewed a whole
bunch of people that went

00:19:08.123 --> 00:19:09.095 align:middle line:90%
to horror movies.

00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And they asked them why they
would go and watch all this.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And a number of them said
there was something about that

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
feeling of being in massive fear
but safe at the same time that

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I found really interesting.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down to
life is about exploring

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.927 align:middle line:84%
your inner experiences
going on inside of you.

00:19:28.927 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're interested
in exploring all of it.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And that involves feeling fear.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It involves being depressed.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And it involves being happy.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And it involves all of
the different emotions

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.183 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
in a daily life.

00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:90%
None of them are good.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:90%
None of them are bad.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They're all part
of the experience.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now one of your points
in managing and eliminating

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
your fears would be, then,
just to accept the fear.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm very easily
thrilled, so I

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
don't need to go on the
roller coasters and all

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
the really extreme rides.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And my husband enjoys those,
so he needs that kind of--

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and there are people who want
to experience a level of fear

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
because that's what they
need for excitement?

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Or because it moves them
in a particular direction.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
To me, nothing
happens in your life

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
if there isn't
something about it that

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
is contributing to you exploring
to what you came here to do,

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
fascinated you so much

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted to explore
it at a very deep level.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the
specifics are, I can't

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
begin to guess, in my own life
or for other people's lives.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I do
consultations with people

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about things,
you can begin to get clues.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
But we're all different.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And there's no rules.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no formulas, except
to me, the generality.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You're exploring what
you came here to explore.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's being managed.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:90%
You can't make a mistake.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are positive and
negative aspects to fear.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:90%
There are kinds of fear.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you were
in the jungle and all

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden you saw a lion
jump out of the woods,

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:84%
there would be some
positive aspects

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to having fear come up
to make you cautious.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But when fear paralyzes you and
stops you from taking action

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.042 align:middle line:84%
or just makes you feel
lousy all the time,

00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps it would
be valuable to look

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:90%
at a way of changing it.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the response to
your book, you said,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
has been very favorable.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.802 align:middle line:90%
You're very pleased with what--

00:21:11.802 --> 00:21:12.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --people are saying.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because when I first
started on this journey,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I honest to god thought this is
weird Bob's solution to a tough

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.828 align:middle line:84%
time, and it isn't going
to interest anybody else.

00:21:21.828 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But I started sharing
it with other people,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and other people
would say, well, you

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
know that idea about the
network, the director,

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:90%
I find that valuable.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:90%
It's helpful.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I started offering
it more organized ways,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and the feedback has
just been tremendous.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.328 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote the book,
and I'm planning

00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to do a bunch of other
things in the future

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to help share these ideas with
people that are interested

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well we are so pleased
that you did write the book.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
and fascinating.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a different way of
looking at our lives, and that

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:90%
will help some people.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
each author has their readers.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so thank you
for serving them well.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if you would like
to be in touch with Robert

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Scheinfeld, please stay tuned
and we'll let you know how you

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.977 align:middle line:90%
can be in touch with him.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Interesting, with Robert
Scheinfeld and his background

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:10%
as a motivational speaker and
all the interesting things that

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:10%
happened to him
brought him to a point

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:10%
where he felt that he
had a message for others

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:10%
that could help them along
this invisible path to success.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.200 align:middle line:84%
If it has helped you, then
we have served you well.
