00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.340 align:middle line:10%
>>Hello.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.423 align:middle line:10%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I want to welcome you

00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle line:10%
to living in balance.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.690 align:middle line:10%
I have as a guest today a
man who has described himself

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:10%
as a messenger, and the message
that he has been sharing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.020 align:middle line:10%
has been resonating
with millions of people.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:84%
He has written a series
of books, "Conversations

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
With God,"
"Friendship With God,"

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and now we have
at a higher level,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.585 align:middle line:84%
he has reached
"Communion With God."

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to share
that with you today.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.732 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:31.176 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Neale Donald Walsh has been
sharing this information

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
over the last
decade, and it really

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
has resonated because his
books have remained at the top

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and on "The New York
Times" Bestseller List.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so pleased to have
him with us, and welcome.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely to be here.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now my audience hasn't
met you before through us,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
so a few people don't
know your story.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And your story is
really fascinating.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.013 align:middle line:84%
And if you could just tell
us just ever so briefly,

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure
you're tired of sharing

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
it, how many times you have told
people, about your conversation

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:90%
with God.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's natural to
want to hear the story

00:01:16.508 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite fascinating,
but my life was really a mess

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
back in the early '90s.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:10%
And I found myself out of a job.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:10%
I found myself in the midst
of a relationship that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:10%
was ending that I did
not want to have ending,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.197 align:middle line:10%
and my health was
going downhill as well.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so nothing was
working in my life.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.238 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up in the middle of
the night-- it was terrible.

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:38.558 align:middle line:84%
It reached the nadir,
really, in my existence.

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was I woke
up in the middle of the night

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
with just incredible
frustration,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and I had lots of anger.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I threw the covers
back and went out

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to the larger part of
the house, found myself

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the couch
and calling out to God,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
as many people have in
their lives, "What does it

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.223 align:middle line:90%
take to make life work?

00:01:55.223 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
to deserve a life

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
of such continuing struggle?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And somebody tell me the rules.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll play if you'll
just tell me the rules."

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.277 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're in-- it was really
desperation at that point?

00:02:04.277 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I was actually
ready to end it all,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's the truth of it.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
The transparent truth is I was
prepared to leave the planet.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I just-- and I said to God,
"I've got to get some answers

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
here or I'm not going to
be around for a long time."

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:90%
And so I did get answers.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I was rece-- I began to
receive answers immediately

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.505 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a voice that
was starting to talk to me

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and answered all
of my questions.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
were so astonishing

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
that I began to write them down.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a legal pad on the
coffee table in front of me,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
which I happened to see.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up, turned on a
lamp, it's 4:20 in the morning,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and I began to write down the
answers that I was receiving.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.208 align:middle line:84%
And those answers led
to other questions.

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked those questions.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.958 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the
questions down just

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of
where I was going

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%
with my mental explorations.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I received answers
to those questions.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And that dialogue
on paper went on

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
for three hours for the
rest of that morning

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:90%
until 8:30 in the morning.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you feel
better right away?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was that information
coming through, was

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.033 align:middle line:90%
that like a healing right there?

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Immediately.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It was the vibration of it,
I think, not just the words

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
but the feeling that
came with the experience.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It really brought me to almost
instant tears, tears of joy

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and of release, you know,
the kind of tears you have

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
when you're just
releasing after holding

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:90%
onto something for so long.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a marvelously
healing experience

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
both intellectually and
metaphysically and spiritually

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.222 align:middle line:84%
And then it went
on for many weeks.

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I would be awakened
automatically at 4 o'clock,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.303 align:middle line:90%
4:15 in the morning.

00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'd get back to
the yellow legal pad

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and continue the writing.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And that has continued
to this very day

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
sporadically through
all these years now.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And how lucky for so
many millions of people.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And, really, the
message has resonated.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as I
read this latest book,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:90%
"Communion With God"--

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and I have to tell you, it was
difficult to read because it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
starts out with those 10
illusions that we humans have,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like those
illusions that we have.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm reading it, I know
this is good information.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But as I went through it,
it was like, there was need,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.442 align:middle line:84%
and there was
disunity and failure

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:07.025 align:middle line:84%
and all these things that were
just so terribly uncomfortable.

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what was happening
here is that God was setting

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
the stage for me to understand
why life as I'm living it is

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
not working and has
not been working.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
And what God said is, "You
and all other human beings

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:84%
are living in a world
of your own illusion."

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.865 align:middle line:84%
It's almost an "Alice
in Wonderland" world.

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are
many, many hundreds

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
of illusions that you engage in,
but there are 10 main illusions

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that if you could
step aside from those,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
everything on your
planet would change.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.353 align:middle line:84%
And so he did list those
10 the illusions of humans,

00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were challenging
to me too when

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.728 align:middle line:84%
I saw them but also
interesting in a way.

00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought, gosh, what's the
story behind these illusions?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And how can I step
away from them?

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I could identify in my
own life a time when I had been

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
or if I am still suffering
from some of these illusions,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
so they are--

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
this is-- there
is truth in this.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not comfortable truth.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But to move beyond it,
we need to really take

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
a look at these
illusions, do we not?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to look at
what's happening in our lives

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and the "Alice in
Wonderland" world

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
we've created in which we
declare that what is real

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
is unreal and what
is unreal is real.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, that's where we have
that shift in consciousness

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:90%
that comes.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:10%
That's why, also, a
lot of your message

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:10%
resonated with me because
I am a student of "A Course

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:10%
in Miracles" and have been
for years and years, student

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:10%
and teacher of, and I think
there is so much truth in we

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:10%
have an inner knowing.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And as those things
do resonate, then we

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.648 align:middle line:84%
do know that OK, yes,
I find truth in this.

00:05:30.648 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone sent me a
letter once that said,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
"Thank you for writing The
Course in Miracles in English."

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Well, I recommended
it to a friend who can't get

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:90%
into the courses.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.788 align:middle line:10%
"Well, how would you like
to do it in one book,

00:05:40.788 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:10%
in, you know, one
smaller"-- and I

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:10%
think you've called it
on the street language,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.945 align:middle line:10%
in the sense this is
stuff we can understand.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Now of these 10 illusions--
so we did list them.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:10%
I said, there is need
and failure, disunity,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:10%
insufficiency,
requirement-- see,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:10%
these things don't
feel real good--

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:10%
judgment, condemnation,
conditionality, superiority,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:10%
and ignorance.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:10%
But you said if you
were to really bring out

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:10%
the one that you'd like to
explain to the audience,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:10%
I thought it would be neat
because you said that all

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:10%
the others are built on need.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But you said probably
more important

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.168 align:middle line:84%
than that is the
illusion of disunity.

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> All the illusions are
built on the illusion of need,

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but the illusion that
interestingly enough has had

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
the most impact on human beings
is the illusion of separation

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
or disunity, the illusion
that disunity exists.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We imagine ourselves to
be separate from God,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and that comes from our
theological mythologies

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
in the creation stories
of most of the world's

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions
and religions.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And those creation stories are
virtually the same from culture

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
to culture and from
religion to religion.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The one that most Western
people are most familiar with

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
is the myth of Adam and Eve.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
But all the cultural stories of
the beginning of the human race

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
start with the
same kind of myth,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and that myth holds that
God separated us from him,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that he found that
we were unworthy

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:90%
of somehow being in paradise.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so God ejected us, if you
please, from the Garden of Eden

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and told us that we would
be forever separate from him

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.645 align:middle line:84%
and that eternal life would
no longer be ours as well.

00:07:12.645 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We would have to earn
it back, if you please,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and in a particular way and
move through a particular tunnel

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.867 align:middle line:84%
or channel or keyhole in
order to have eternal life.

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And this illusion
of separation, which

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
has been taught to us now by
most of the mythologies that

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
stand behind our belief
systems and our religions,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, not what's so.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That you cannot separate all
that is from all that is.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
There is only one thing,
and that is life itself.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And the words "life" and
"God" are interchangeable,

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.595 align:middle line:84%
as I understand it, in the
messages I have received.

00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's like saying that life
can be separated from life,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.925 align:middle line:84%
and that would be
impossible to do.

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the illusion
of separation

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, an illusion,
but it's a very powerful one.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:10%
And we imagine ourselves to
be separate from God, which

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:10%
allows us to construct
a God who has powers

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:10%
that we don't have as opposed
to us knowing that we are

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:10%
part and parcel of
God and therefore

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:10%
have the same powers to create
and to destroy that we imagine

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
that the deity has.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Worse yet, though, our idea
of being separate from God

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
creates an illusion that we are
also separate from each other

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and from everything
else in all of life.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
That allows us to destroy
what nature or God has

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
created, as we
are now destroying

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%
the Earth every hour, every day.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It also allows us to do damage
to each other physically

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and
emotionally as well.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
We treat each other
and we treat the planet

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and we treat the
environment in ways

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we would never treat
any of that if we

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:90%
thought it was part of us.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's where
the healing takes place.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can look
at someone else and I

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
can realize that they
are like a part of me

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
or we share the God within
and then I think, "OK,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're acting out
this particular role.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.372 align:middle line:90%
They're doing this thing.

00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that interesting,"
and it also means

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that I can look at them and
say, "This too, then, perhaps I

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
could do," even the
worst of the people.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:90%
There is the potentiality there.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>> In fact, we have.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
that I've seen--

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.568 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of
anything that I've

00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
seen either in history
or in present day

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
behavior of human beings that
hasn't existed at some level,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:90%
in some proportion inside of me.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.437 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, a
wonderful metaphysical teacher,

00:09:20.437 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
is fond of saying, "There's
a little bit of Hitler

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
in all of us."

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see
behaviors of other people,

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:84%
we need to just own that
at least an aspect of that

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
exists within ourselves and
that we've experienced that,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it's power
hungriness or violence

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
or simply being a
person that's less

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
than we would like to be in most
of the moments of our lives.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so to condemn it over there
is to condemn it over here,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
but the true master
never condemns and never

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
judges anything that he sees--

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
not the Christed one, not
the Buddha, not Krishna, not

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Muhammad, not Sai Baba.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, none of the
masters, living or dead,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
would judge anyone but would
rather say, "Ah, there I

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.975 align:middle line:90%
go again, being violent."

00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:07.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Or there I go again--

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So then that's--

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.728 align:middle line:90%
>> --being responsible.

00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> --when the healing can
take place of that particular

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:10%
illusion, or we can move out
of that illusion once we just

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:10%
acknowledge it, that we
have been separated--

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and then begin
to act as if, in fact,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:10%
the circumstance of
our oneness were real.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
treat any other person badly

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:84%
if you look into their eyes
and come to the realization

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that there's only one
of you in the room

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
out pictured as two
separate beings,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:90%
but one essence nonetheless.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And so treating each other in
ways that are not appropriate

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
or that would hurt you if you
received that same treatment

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
become more and more difficult.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And the golden
rule, treat others

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
as you would have
yourself be treated,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
becomes more than
just a wonderful

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:90%
conceptual admonition.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a very
practical rule of life

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.973 align:middle line:84%
because, in fact,
you are being treated

00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the way you treat
others because there's

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:90%
only one of you in the room.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Now some of what you have
written is controversial,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.355 align:middle line:84%
and you have raised this, as
I said, to a bit of a higher

00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:10.855 align:middle line:84%
level with the
"Communion With God,"

00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
but I want to take
a break, because I'd

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
like you to kind of
explain to the audience

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
how we have this God within
and how that's OK for us

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves as being
the God and the creator too.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.313 align:middle line:90%
>> But we'll take a break.

00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And so if you will
stay tuned, we

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.257 align:middle line:84%
will be right back with more
with Neale Donald Walsh.

00:11:29.257 --> 00:11:33.233 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And my guest today
is a messenger,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:10%
and his name is
Neale Donald Walsh.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And his messages have
been brought to you

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
through the series of
"Conversations With God,"

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
"Friendship With God,"
and now the latest book

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:90%
is "Communion With God."

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:10%
And as I said, I
thought this was--

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.777 align:middle line:10%
you said, of course, that
if I were picking this up,

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:10%
it was the perfect moment when
I was supposed to be reading it

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:10%
and this was our moment
and I wouldn't even

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:10%
have read the book if
the message was-- if I

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:10%
wasn't ready for the message.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing happens by accident.

00:12:09.877 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to make a
little comment, if I could.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.335 align:middle line:10%
You keep calling me a messenger,
and thank you very much,

00:12:14.335 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:10%
but the truth is
we're all messengers.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:10%
And the whole point of the
"With God" series of books

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:10%
is that every single
human being is having

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:10%
an ongoing
conversation with God,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:10%
every single human being
is receiving inspiration

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:10%
on a moment to moment
basis from the divine,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:10%
and every single human
being is a messenger.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.198 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to give anyone
the impression that I imagine

00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
or that I would even allow
anyone else to imagine

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that I'm somehow
separate from or

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.618 align:middle line:90%
other than the average person.

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be part of
those illusions, would it not?

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.785 align:middle line:90%
>> It would, in fact.

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, only you have
brought it to a point--

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and as I said, I think
it's in 25 languages

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and millions of copies have
been sold of your work--

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that you said you
started with writing

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
so that the average man
could read it, understand it,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.996 align:middle line:84%
you addressed those issues
he was dealing with from sex

00:13:00.996 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, I didn't
do it-- yes, that's true,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.257 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't do
that deliberately.

00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was no
thought about it in my head.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.792 align:middle line:84%
I think God has had a
plan, but I had none.

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Really, the first book wasn't
even written as a book.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It was simply a bunch of
pages in my personal journal.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got a legal
pad, actually, and I

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
was writing to
myself for myself,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
never even imagining that
anyone would ever see it.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't as if
I sat down and said,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.852 align:middle line:84%
OK, the first book
will be at this level,

00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the second book at this level,
and the third, and so forth.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
What happened, however,
as an organic part

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
of the process that was going
on in my life, the material

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
from Book 1 to Book 5
in the "With God" series

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
began to increase in complexity
and in spiritual sophistication

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
until now, with
"Communion With God,"

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
we have a highly
sophisticated piece

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual material
that explains

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
the cosmological
construction of our life.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And it does, as I said,
talk about the God within,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that we are God,
we are the creator.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It empowers us in a
way that would allow

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.475 align:middle line:90%
us to master the illusions.

00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
of those sections

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that you have on
mastering the illusions.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.305 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the beauty of
"Communion With God."

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It not only lists the 10
illusions of human beings,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
but it lists, one chapter
for each illusion,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
how to step outside
of those illusions

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and live with them
but not within them

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
or, as some prior teachers have
said, how to be in this world

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:90%
but not of it.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the book concludes
with some wonderful text

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the experience
of meeting with the creator

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.437 align:middle line:84%
and having an actual communion
with God in one's own life.

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's an
extraordinary book.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very excited about
it and just very humbled

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to have been able to play a
part in bringing it through.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and as you move through
those illusions and then you

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
teach us how we can master them
or how the information is being

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
shared, each of us then in our
own lives can have that kind

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:90%
of identification, as I said.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
How have I practiced
that illusion?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.902 align:middle line:90%
How can I-- and do you know--

00:14:56.902 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting
because it serves people

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
very well when you can bring
it then to the practical level

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
again and realize that in
a situation when you are

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:90%
very upset, you should not be.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
step back from it

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of practice
these principles.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.435 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I would
say you should not

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
be because there are
no shoulds in life,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.465 align:middle line:84%
and I always tell people,
"Don't should on yourself."

00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:19.632 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure that I would
say that you should not

00:15:19.632 --> 00:15:20.608 align:middle line:90%
be very upset.

00:15:20.608 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I think what I would say is you
have a choice not to be upset

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.983 align:middle line:84%
and you will be upset
or not upset depending

00:15:24.983 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
on what you assess
is of greatest

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
benefit to you and to
the world that you touch

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and to the experience
you're creating.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Less and less in my life
do I experience that it's

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:90%
beneficial for me to be upset.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I do get upset and
I demonstrate my upsetedness,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
but fewer times now than, let's
say, three or four or five

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
years ago and far fewer
than 10 or 20 years ago.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.413 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really a changed
man in that regard.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I still have
a long way to go.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> While you are evolving--

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the job of us
being here on the planet is

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.868 align:middle line:90%
to evolve, to move closer to.

00:15:54.868 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's what we're up to.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the whole process.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The process of life
itself is the process

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:84%
by which human beings and
all species in the universe

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
evolve to higher and
higher expressions of who

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:90%
we all really are.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we are
God godding or God

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
becoming the next
grandest version of who

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:90%
God imagines God's self to be.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Now a lot of people-- the
controversy might come with

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
the people who don't think
of themselves as God.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And with that,
how do you explain

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that we aren't really
separate from God, there's

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
that illusion of separation?

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know how
anyone else explains it.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
What I say is what I was
given in the material.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:90%
There is only one thing.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, all
there was is all there is,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and all there is
is all there was,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing else.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Now most people agree
to that when you say,

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning, all
there is all there was,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.267 align:middle line:90%
and there was nothing else."

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Most people can say, "Yes, we've
kind of been taught something

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:90%
like that in our own childhood."

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But then I say, "OK, just
do not accept the mythology

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that somehow between
the beginning and now,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
we were separated off from
all that is, that we somehow

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
got separated, leaving all
that is over there as God

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and leaving us over
here as somehow

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
other than all that is."

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.419 align:middle line:84%
If God is truly all that
is, all that ever was

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
and all that ever will
be, world without end,

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that would have to
include us by definition.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And if it includes
us by definition,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
then to deny that we are an
aspect or a part of that which

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
we call God or life itself would
be to deny our very existence.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> The oneness.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You have statements
of ultimate truth,

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we are
supposed to remind ourselves.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:90%
"Nothing in my world is real.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
The meaning of everything
is the meaning I give it.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I am who I say I am
and my experience

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:90%
is that what I say it is."

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My experience is
what I say it is, yes.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are three incredibly
powerful statements that can

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
change one's life
virtually overnight.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so in each
situation, if we go to that,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:90%
we remember our ultimate truths.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And you also have the triad.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is, "See the
illusion as an illusion,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
decide what it means, and
recreate yourself anew."

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the process by which
we work with the illusions

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and change our moment
to moment experience.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> See the illusion as an
illusion and decide what you

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:90%
want it to mean.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we have to
go into that witness state

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:90%
and step back in each situation?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful way you've
put it, to go into that witness

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
state, to witness
our own experience

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and then call it what
you choose to call it,

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it
really all is illusory

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and you can call it whatever
you wish to call it.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:10%
Wise people-- my mother
was one of those--

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:10%
would be in a very bad situation
and say, "This is a blessing.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:10%
And I may not be able to
experience the blessing right

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:10%
now, but I know that
before too much time

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.472 align:middle line:10%
goes by I will see the blessing
that God has given me here."

00:18:42.472 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to
her, "How do you

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.805 align:middle line:84%
know that God has given
you a blessing here?"

00:18:45.805 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would
say, "Because God

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
gives me nothing else
but blessings ever."

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And from experience--

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:10%
>> She was a woman of
great, great faith.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> She probably from her
experiences then had seen how

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that had been true
and how that had--

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> In her life.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --worked out in her life.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And we can too if we reflect
back and see those things that

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:10%
we thought were wrong and
what happened as a result,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.485 align:middle line:10%
the gift in the
problem, as they say.

00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And all we have to do is have
faith that what's been our own

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
experience in the
past will, in fact,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
continue to be our
experience in the future.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And then close that gap
between having the experience

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and seeing it for what it
is, rather than seeing it

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
five years later as a gift
or three days later as a gift

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
or three hours later as a gift
to just kind of close that gap

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and see it as a gift
even as it is occurring.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:90%
That's mastery in living.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't want us to
really think that everything

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that comes to us is a lesson
or there are hints from

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.242 align:middle line:84%
What you had said was
interpret it yourself.

00:19:41.242 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you're saying here.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Decide what it means.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't like,
wow, I wonder what

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
the universe meant by that.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.425 align:middle line:84%
The universe hasn't
any secret meaning,

00:19:49.425 --> 00:19:51.383 align:middle line:84%
and the universe does
not have a secret agenda.

00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
If God had one of those, he
would just tell us what it is.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
life is that we

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
get to define things as
we choose to define them,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and yet every act is an
act of self definition.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we have the
full creative power

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to call a thing what
we choose to call it

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and to describe and
experience to ourselves

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
in the way we choose
to describe it.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
having the experience

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
itself in a different way,
the moment you describe

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
an experience in
a particular way,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.665 align:middle line:84%
you change the
experience itself.

00:20:19.665 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It moves right
along with the law

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
of physics, which says that
nothing which is observed

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.767 align:middle line:90%
is unaffected by the observer.

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I sometimes think of it
as raise it to a higher level

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to look at
what's going on there.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.203 align:middle line:84%
That's another way that we've
been taught, that we can--

00:20:34.203 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a beautiful
observation.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that we can look
at this life a little bit

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:90%
But if we realize--

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's the gift
of the book-- is that these 10

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.375 align:middle line:84%
illusions are the 10
illusions of human beings,

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
it has been true to our nature
and our culture to have these,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and if we can just
acknowledge them and then

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.632 align:middle line:84%
with the information, like
you have shared, master them.

00:20:56.632 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The beauty of the illusions
is that if we use them

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.865 align:middle line:84%
as gifts, we continue to live
with them but not within them.

00:21:01.865 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
No one is suggesting that we
should throw these illusions

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.480 align:middle line:84%
out, but that we should use them
for the purposes for which they

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.355 align:middle line:90%
were intended.

00:21:08.355 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
As a magician who
has learned how

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to use his own tricks
to create pure magic,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.867 align:middle line:84%
we can do the same
thing in our lives.

00:21:14.867 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're not going to
get rid of the illusions?

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:10%
The idea is to stay
with the illusion,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:10%
but to use it as the tool for
which it was actually created.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's all described
in some detail in the book.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally, in our
last few moments,

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for the wonderful work

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:90%
that you've been doing.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Since you've become so
successful financially,

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
you've been able to create
a non-profit organization.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:10%
And people can be
in touch with you,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to
let them know how.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.875 align:middle line:84%
We have some
wonderful work we're

00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:44.573 align:middle line:84%
doing throughout the
world to hopefully

00:21:44.573 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
bring some peace to the world
and some new ideas about God

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.532 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of all
the "With God" books

00:21:49.532 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
can be reduced to one sentence
from "God to the Human Race,"

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.037 align:middle line:84%
which is simply, "You've
got me all wrong."

00:21:55.037 --> 00:21:57.142 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] Blessings
and thank you.

00:21:57.142 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll stay
tuned, we'll let

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.975 align:middle line:84%
you know how you can be in
touch with Neale Donald Walsch

00:22:00.975 --> 00:22:01.794 align:middle line:90%
and with us.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in our lives, we do
have the opportunity to have

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and we are always having,
whether we have realized it

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
or not, a communion with God.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.470 align:middle line:84%
We, each of us individually,
can open to that.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at our life as
we have with these illusions

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
live in the illusions

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and also really overcome them
in a sense of mastering them,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
master the illusion, and then--

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I love that-- recreate
your life anew.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.
