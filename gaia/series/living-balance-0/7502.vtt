00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to welcome
you to "Living In Balance."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I have a fascinating
program for you today.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We recently took a
journey to the mountains

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.510 align:middle line:90%
of North Carolina.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
We visited the Ascension
Academy and met

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:90%
an order of monks, the Ishayas.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%
They date back in time.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:90%
They are ancient.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And they have a message
for the new millennium.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to share
that with you today.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.867 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful and
fascinating information.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole array
of books, much more

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
than I've been able
to read, but I'm

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
in a middle of two of
them right now, and tapes,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:90%
also, too, about ascension.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I do have
with us two women who

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
are monks, teachers,
of the Ishaya

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:90%
information and the order.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'd like to welcome Parama.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And Ananta.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Wonderful to
have you with us.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure to be here.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I said I have in front
of me here this whole array

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of books.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the middle of a
wonderful adventure called

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
"First Thunder," and I
can't wait to finish it.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But also, I've been
listening to the tapes.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm learning quite a bit.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I have
a lot of questions.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
My first question
might be, ascension,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
could you define
ascension for us?

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Simply what ascension is--

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and the way I describe it--

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is for us to rise above our
limitations and our boundaries.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people when they
think of ascension

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
think they're
leaving their body,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
or they're going
to another world.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's to have a full human
experience in this reality.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Ishayas' ascension
offers a way and a means

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and techniques to achieve that.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> To have the
experience here and now.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you do ascend, Ananta,
is the terminology that you use

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
when you go into the
process, which is not unlike

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:90%
a meditation, but it is more.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And it is different than that.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And you do it with your
eyes open or closed.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The great part I
find about it is it

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
brings you right to this moment.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you leave
all these different behavior

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
patterns and reactions
behind, and are present now,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and experience now.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And be fully human here.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how much we
move beyond our limitations.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I called a friend
yesterday who has taken

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:90%
the first attitude, I believe.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Our first class.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the first class.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, I don't
nearly have as much time

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.312 align:middle line:90%
as I would like to ascend.

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And she kind of
giggled, because it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
does sound a little
presumptuous when

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not into the terminology
that you are ascending.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And I loved it when
we went to visit you,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.833 align:middle line:84%
and you said, now, we do ascend
between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you understand
the purpose behind it,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that that would be one
of the things that would be

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
helpful.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It is a message
that you're bringing

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
for the new millennium,
because it is time

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that we, as a human race, look
to more positive, and more

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
healing, and more
helpful ways of dealing

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:90%
with others of mankind.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Is that kind of part of
the purpose of learning

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%
the ascension, Ananta?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just really being--

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:90%
what is enlightenment?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's being truly ourselves
without the past behavioral

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
patterns that we
don't even realize

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.168 align:middle line:90%
that we're reacting from.

00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk a little
bit about the wonderful academy,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:90%
because you do teach there.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%
We have some photographs.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
And we started with the castle.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to
see on the monitor.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful center.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:84%
As I said, you called
it Shangri-La or Mecca.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And here we have on the
monitor the beautiful structure

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
where people come together to
eat, and some of the classes

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:90%
are with angels in the front.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And MSI is the energy behind it.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.219 align:middle line:84%
He was the founder of or
brought the information to you.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said
he liked castles.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>> He loves castles.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
In his former life,
he was an architect.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:90%
And he loved to build castles.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first
castle on the property.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And the property
is 40 acres about.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Approximately 40 acres.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful rolling
land, fruit trees,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and lots of
dormitories and housing

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
facilities for the teachers,
and the teachers' trainees.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We have another photo.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And this is of some of
the teachers, monks,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:10%
and the differentiation between.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:10%
We can see them.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:10%
They're all greeting us from
the side of the castle there.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:10%
All dressed in red,
black, or white.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:10%
And people are either
teachers and/or monks

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:10%
that are at the academy.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Largely, the teachers.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.035 align:middle line:84%
There are trainees, people
who've taken the workshop

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and decide that this is
what they want to do.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And they come forward
to be a teacher.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not required that you're
a monk to be a teacher.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But as we evolve,
as the stress starts

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
falling off, the different
belief systems that we live by,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
we get more in touch
with who we truly are

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.905 align:middle line:90%
and what we truly want.

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
more and more of them

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.592 align:middle line:90%
are just becoming monks.

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've said you've
dedicated your life to it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
you've found that it
was very important.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And people have this
connotation or what they think

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:90%
a monk looks like.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And when sometimes
people see us, they say,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't look like
those bald-head monks

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:90%
we expect to see.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dedication, what
we dedicate our lives to.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We dedicate our lives to god,
and to healing of humanity.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
That may sound
real big and lofty.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And the healing starts with
the healing of ourselves.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we do.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We go out as teachers, but
we're students all the time.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And it just expands
our consciousness,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and lets us know
who we truly are.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the great
adventure of life.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have centers
all over-- internationally,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the
United States, Ananta.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we do.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Japan, Australia, England,
and in this country,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
here in Florida,
Minneapolis, Seattle.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And you teach from Dallas.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
You just teach
wherever the need is,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and the centers are created.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> You build it.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
We come.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think it's a--

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
if it is a lofty ideal,
I think it's fabulous.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I love people who've dedicated
themselves to healing mankind.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
We need it.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's so much fun.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's so easy.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I also want to show--
there's some really fun things

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:90%
from the center, the academy.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And the dome, you
are on Biodome Drive.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:90%
And I love this dome.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
plants now growing inside.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's a variety of things
that go on at the academy.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Among the things you
said are the teaching,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:90%
but also you have gardens.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And hopefully the
biodome will be turned

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
into a hydroponic growing area.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent idea.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We have another photo of
us visiting you there.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And also, your
significant other, and he

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:90%
is also dressed in white.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know
he would be on it.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:90%
He's going to hate it.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:90%
He just ran in.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.405 align:middle line:90%
He'd just woken from ascending.

00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, he was wonderful.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We liked him.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I like him, too.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You like him
really well, too.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So you monks can have
relationships, and that's nice.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So we're not strict.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:90%
There are rules.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:90%
No rules.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no rules.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make rules
and make it hard, that's OK.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Each one of us
creates in the moment.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's so exciting.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, I love this.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
How long have you
been involved, Ananta?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, Par and I
both at the same time.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We got started back
in the summer of '96.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:90%
And we're still with it.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> As we're called to this.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, you had a life before.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And what did you do?

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:90%
What was your background?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Or what brought you to--

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I was in the health field.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I started
finding with clients

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
is that different
body symptomologies,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do
and help them with it,

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
they keep reoccurring, because
it was something fundamental.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Someone had to change
within themselves.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.786 align:middle line:84%
And once they make a shift, then
the whole symptomologies stop.

00:08:28.786 --> 00:08:30.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It was if I truly wanted
that desire to be a healer,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.348 align:middle line:84%
then how am I going
to help them do that?

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just putting
another Band-Aid on.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's how
I got to North Carolina.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
From that aspect, it
was like, what next?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because everything I was
doing seemed to come to a halt

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.047 align:middle line:90%
with that realization.

00:08:49.047 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And you came from the
alternative healing side.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So both of you were
healers before,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:90%
but your background was--

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had a practice
in Chinese medicine.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I was a diplomat in homeopathy,
classical homeopathy.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
You name it-- reiki, shiatsu,
past life regression,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
healing with sound
and frequency.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't even remember.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You just did it all, all of
those possible ways of healing

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And you found that
there was still

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
something missing there, too.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew intrinsically in my
heart that people could heal

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's exciting.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And people as
healers assist people.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And with the Ishayas'
ascension, you

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.965 align:middle line:90%
can take somebody to the door.

00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And with the
ascension attitudes,

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
it takes them right
through the door.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We have another
beautiful shot.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is of the sacred pool.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you've
actually done baptismals.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
down a mountainside.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And people also sit in that
very tranquil place and ascend,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
which is a quiet, again,
meditation, but not quite

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
a meditation.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a combination of
a prayer and meditation.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how I look at it.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't have to be quiet.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in the
airport with your eyes open,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:90%
driving a car.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not structured
in any sense.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But it has changed
your lives dramatically.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in a world of
magic, the magic of now,

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and creation, and every moment.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like people want
to make appointments.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I like to know sometimes
what's going to happen.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's got to
be in the moment.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You've said that as we
visited with you there.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And you said that
a couple of times

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
in a couple of different ways.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:90%
But it's that "Be here now.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Be in the present.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Be in the moment."

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
are living your life,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
because what we've been
taught from ancient times

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is that it's always OK
right there in the minute.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.905 align:middle line:84%
Life is very good
right in that moment.

00:10:48.905 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's precious.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not worrying,
and we're not fearful

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
if we're in the moment
and experiencing it.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my life used
to be fear and worry.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:90%
I had the biggest list.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I can compare
it with anybody.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And you could
choose peace instead.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a little
miracle of an angel

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:84%
we're going to share with
them the next time, and also

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful scenes of
a wedding from the center.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But I also want you to
explain a little bit more

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
about the concepts
of the attitude.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So we will talk in the
next segment about that.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.746 align:middle line:84%
with the Ishaya teachers
of the ascension.

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:35.092 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:35.092 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
If you are just
joining us, we are

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
talking with two Ishaya monks.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are two
beautiful women who

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
get to spend time in a
wonderful academy that

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is in the mountains of North
Carolina, where we did visit.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:90%
We are talking about ascension.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And we are looking at
that word differently.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
A message that was brought
from ancient times,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and it actually is techniques
that are brought, I understand,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:90%
from Jesus through St. John.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And those writings have
been hidden until we're

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
ready for them as a society.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the
history of this?

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That is part of the history.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And it seems what's happening
in this new millennium,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.102 align:middle line:84%
people's hearts are opening
so rapidly and so easily.

00:12:28.102 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And with the Ishaya's
ascension, it

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
allows people to open
their hearts even more.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient times,
people talked about love,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about
love all the time now.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet it was a
really loving time.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding
now is that people

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:90%
are opening their hearts.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration of the
universe and who we truly are

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.557 align:middle line:84%
And these techniques
help us remember that.

00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's really what it is.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:90%
It's techniques.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
teachings of Jesus

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:90%
were actually like techniques.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you have really put it
in a logical order where people

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
can benefit from the teachings.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And the word is
ascension, but we're

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:84%
talking about spheres,
attitudes, and techniques.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that kind of
the way this falls?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can teach people
how to progress along

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual path
toward enlightenment.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> All teachings point
to your own heart.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And all knowledge is within.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's just covered up.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
We are always in touch
with the infinite.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.317 align:middle line:84%
And we don't always
recognize that.

00:13:31.317 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
These techniques help
break down those walls

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:90%
so that we do know that.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's our full experience.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Not something we
think or believe,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
because there's nothing--

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
none of the stuff that we
talk about in ascension

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with the belief system.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going beyond that
to a true experience

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:90%
of knowing who we are.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So you don't have to believe
in anything is what you said.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe in the concepts,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:90%
but you have to be open.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the
prerequisites is to be

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.543 align:middle line:90%
innocent.

00:14:00.543 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, OK.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And where do we
learn the easiest?

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It's when we're children,
when we're innocent, when we

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:90%
want to know all the answers.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
perpetuate through our lives,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
asking those questions, and
never getting the answers.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's hidden beneath
so many experiences,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%
that we've had our lives--

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've defined our
lives by, and we are not

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:90%
those experiences.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We are truly the infinite
and the unbounded.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn to ascend
and use the techniques,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:90%
that gets uncovered.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful treasure
who we are gets--

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
it's like we always love those
stories looking for the hidden

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:90%
treasures.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:90%
We're the treasures.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.057 align:middle line:90%
And everything is within us.

00:14:41.057 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the philosophy
is-- and I listened--

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
you have a free tape that
you share with people,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:84%
anyone who'd like to
know more about it.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.482 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of the people
who were talking on it

00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
referred back to the
course in miracles,

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.315 align:middle line:84%
and made references back to all
behaviors either come from fear

00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
or come from love.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the
philosophy, how would you

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:90%
explain it as far as--

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
does it align with the
course of miracles?

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Does it align with
other philosophies?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Or how would you state
the background of it?

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Who might be interested in
learning these techniques.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.453 align:middle line:90%
>> There's only one truth.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And we just interpret it
through our nervous systems

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
from our different
past experiences

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.935 align:middle line:84%
so that it looks
a particular way.

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
As I was saying before, it
points back to our own hearts.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:90%
And the truth is there.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And by using our techniques,
it just brings us back

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:90%
to our own hearts.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And the truth is there.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So you start finding that
some beliefs we've had,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
which is from a belief.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It had no validation
in it at all,

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
because there is one truth.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And we experience that.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we saw it
coming from, instead of coming

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
from the different lies of our
past beliefs and judgments.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everyone was smiling
and seemed very much at peace

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:90%
where we were.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.868 align:middle line:84%
There was a very special thing
that happened in the winter.

00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have a photograph
of an angel, an ice angel,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that just simply appeared.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And you said that there
are magical things that

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
happen all the time
at the academy,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:90%
at the Ascension Academy.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> And throughout life.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they manifest,
though, as ice angels.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.642 align:middle line:84%
>> That was something--
sometimes they're a little more

00:16:12.642 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:90%
dramatic.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And this ice angel happened
to be photographed by Ananta.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you are the photographer.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>> I just happened to
have a camera that day.

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:23.015 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> She did a really--

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It was really
quite by surprise,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
if I can talk about
it a little bit.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, go right ahead.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.865 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a waterfall
right where this angel is.

00:16:29.865 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
We have a little pond.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And it was just around the fall.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So in the evening it
freezes over a little bit.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And the water just started
dripping on some dead branches,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:90%
or just by the side.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And just by chance
two of the teacher

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
trainees had been walking along.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And out of the corner of
their eye they looked over,

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.315 align:middle line:90%
and they saw it.

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- and
it was amazing.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
As you can see from
the picture, it almost

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
looked like it was
actually carved.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.283 align:middle line:84%
It had feathers on it,
and the head, the wings.

00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually just a
branch that was holding--

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
it just happened to be
there by the waterfall.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It was just incredible.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Had one tried to
carve an angel, they

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.874 align:middle line:90%
could not have done any better.

00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
>> The perfect
folds of the dress.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.419 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:90%
>> And the feathers showed.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And you shared with
us-- and I love this part,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.102 align:middle line:84%
because this is a spiritual
community where people come

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:15.902 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And some live there, and
some come just to be trained.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot--
in your scrapbook

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that you were sharing, there
were a lot of weddings.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
are finding connections

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
through Ishaya, it would appear.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful wedding
scene that we can see here.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they're
people of like mind

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
who are drawn together
who are finding

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:90%
that this serves them well.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that come as couples.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it serves
them to separate.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that find themselves,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:90%
and they find another mate.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
And we have Ishaya weddings.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wedding of soul
and spirit for eternity.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- the first time I
experienced one of the weddings

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
there, it just blew me away.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, how lovely.

00:18:07.762 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you like-- and
do you stay at the academy

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
most of the time, Ananta,
or do you travel a lot?

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> All the teachers are based at
the academy in North Carolina,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
but we do travel out.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And we do stay at the
centers for several months

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
at a time, especially
internationals.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:90%
So we do go back there.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It is our home base, but
we are all over the place.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
spiritual communities

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that people are finding like
mind, gathering together,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:90%
especially in North Carolina.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
How do you like that,
being with other people who

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
are on a similar path and who
are ascending together and so

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:90%
forth?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:84%
What is it like to live
in what I consider to be

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:90%
like a spiritual community?

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very different.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.038 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's quite
rewarding in the sense

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that you have an opportunity
of utopia, where that magic is.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:90%
We all seem to want that.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And we never seem to be able
to create that in our lives.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you find one
where everybody has

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.775 align:middle line:90%
the same experience of the one.

00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're drawing on.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not a belief,
so you don't have

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
contradictions,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that everybody
has an experience.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
truly themselves.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
behave in a particular way.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
You just have to be yourself.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you come back
out into the other world,

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
do you have a culture
shock every time?

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Or do you bring so much
of that peace with you

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
when you come back?

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have the opportunity
to use the Ishaya's ascension

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
attitudes with our
eyes open all the time.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice to
be in the moment.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And whatever experience we
have, we have that experience.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you say Ishaya
attitudes, praise, gratitude,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and love are three.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And those attitudes
we can all share.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Those are basic to human kind.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
in our society

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:90%
is that we're run by our minds.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And so many thoughts
go through our minds.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the tape, you'll hear
that every thought creates

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:90%
a universe.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And why not create a
universe that we want

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and create through praise,
gratitude, and love?

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And using the attitudes
keeps one in the moment.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:90%
The past is gone.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:90%
The future is yet to unfold.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that is real,
supposedly real, is the moment.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And you stay in the moment
by using and choosing

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
the attitude of truth,
praise, gratitude, and love.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really very simple.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It does sound basic, Ananta
to human life, to the human.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like
everybody, except humans,

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.987 align:middle line:90%
have done the point of praising.

00:20:57.987 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the humans that
seem to find everything

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
wrong with everything in
the real world, everything

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:90%
that's occurred in their lives.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
You've judged
everything so harshly,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of giving
praise, and gratitude,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and just loving every
experience we have.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.265 align:middle line:84%
>> It does sound
simple, does it not?

00:21:14.265 --> 00:21:15.065 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's our natural--

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.398 align:middle line:90%
it's who we really are.

00:21:17.398 --> 00:21:18.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:18.198 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've covered it up
with our judgments and boxed

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
ourselves up so that we feel
all wrapped up and tied up,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and under so much pressure
and ready for breakdowns.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And for what, when
life is really easy.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, you are sharing
gratitude, praise, and love.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:90%
And we do appreciate that.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to be
in touch with the Ishayas,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:84%
they also will
offer to you a tape

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.627 align:middle line:84%
that you might want to learn
more about the ascensions.

00:21:44.627 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:90%
And just stay tuned.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll let you know how
you can be in touch

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:90%
with them, and with us.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.768 align:middle line:90%
We would love to hear from you.

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:55.704 align:middle line:10%

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Praise, gratitude, and love.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't go
wrong with that, can we?

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have visited
the Ishaya order.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you have enjoyed
it, hopefully, there

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
was a message in there
that can remind you

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that praise, gratitude, and love
can help you to live in balance

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in mind, body, spirit.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
