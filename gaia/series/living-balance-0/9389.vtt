00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:06.320 align:middle line:90%
to our healing series.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to be talking
about healing with drama,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and how can that help us to
live in balance in mind, body,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.455 align:middle line:90%
Come join us on "Shakti-Hill."

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.425 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Healing with drama--
that's what we're

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
going to be talking about.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And who better to talk with it
about than John Maxwell Taylor,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:90%
British actor and playwright.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, Georgia.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.747 align:middle line:90%
Delighted to be here.

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is exciting.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I saw that you were
going to be performing

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:90%
"Forever Jung" locally.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Not young as in Y-O.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No, Jung.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Jung.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.156 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:54.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:56.952 align:middle line:90%
>> And tell us about that.

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing with that?

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.868 align:middle line:84%
And you're going around
the United States

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%
doing "Forever Jung."

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my third year
touring "Forever Jung."

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the life-- the mystical
life journey of Carl Gustav

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Jung, in which I play 20
different characters, including

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Jung, his wife, his mistress,
Sigmund Freud, the prophet

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Elijah, who appears to him
in a dream with Salome,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and the various inhabitants
of the lunatic asylum

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:90%
he interned in, and so forth.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite a drama.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It deals with real people
and archetypes and dreams,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to tell this journey of him
from the cradle to the grave.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And he even comes back at
the end and sums it all up,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and what it all meant
from behind the scenes.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> From the cradle to the grave.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, he
is a fascinating author.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And many books have been
written about him and by him.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And he has a real message.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And, as you are
doing this, you must

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
have felt that he was
one of your teachers.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I have.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I've often felt an
overlighting presence

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:90%
when I've been doing it.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:90%
But any actor feels that.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Someone asked Charlton
Heston, did you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
find God when you were playing
in "The Ten Commandments?"

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I can't so I
walked on Sinai and found God.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:90%
But I did find Moses.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And if one can find the core of
the character one is playing,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
particularly if it's a person
who has actually lived,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
then that person does sort
of overlight you in a way,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
or their living archetype does.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us about Jung, as he
has become your friend and you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
are expressing
information about him.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jung made this
wonderful statement that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.723 align:middle line:84%
reality lies at the point of
tension between the opposites.

00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So somebody once
said to me, well,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
having played Jung for
so long, do you like him?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And I said, yes and no.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have this
shadow side to our nature.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what Jung has brought
to our awareness, you see.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's very necessary
that we have that part

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.785 align:middle line:84%
because everything works
on a form of electricity.

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
When you plug your lamp
into the wall, for example,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
you have a positive charge
and a negative charge.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you remove one of
those prongs and stick it in,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the light won't come on.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So within us there are these two
currents of electromagnetism,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that are
there all the time.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We need both of
them for the light

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.515 align:middle line:90%
to come on in our consciousness.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And Jung taught this sense of
self acceptance in which, yes,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you see all these
parts about yourself

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:90%
that most people don't like.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Disown them, and
then project them

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
onto other people or nations
or subgroups within society.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But when we can re-own
that aspect to ourselves

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.302 align:middle line:84%
and live comfortably
with it, then we

00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
won't project it
onto other people.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
It's really taking care of the
groundwork of spirituality.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.892 align:middle line:90%
>> So he serves as well in that.

00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Projection is one
of those things--

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Projection.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --we want to get past.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Also, his concept of
synchronicity was very

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is being used
and really honored

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
by so many people, as far as
on their path they will say,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
well, there was a synchronicity.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Synchronicity, yes.

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no coincidence.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And do you bring that out?

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is a--

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's coming
out for all of us now.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it in our
lives tremendously.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is touched
upon in the play.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
found is because he

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
is the father of
synchronicity, if you will,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the man who coined the
phrase that The Police made

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
the album about and
that we are all now

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
incorporating into our
vocabulary, what is happening

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
as I travel around
doing the play--

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
it just becomes one
synchronistic experience

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I am writing a
record of my journey with them

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
on the road called
"Synchronicity in Action

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
on the Stage of Life."

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's gotten to be so
just like that, all the time.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I bet.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
See, Jung's being--
I didn't quite

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
finish what I was saying before
when I said yes and no to Jung.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Because by accepting both
of the aspects of him,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.185 align:middle line:84%
I'm in touch with the being that
is the sum total of the man.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
See, and this is a very
powerful living force

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
which anyone can tap into.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a healing force.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who is
aspiring spiritually

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.907 align:middle line:84%
should have some
connection with Jung,

00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:84%
even if it's only reading
"Memories, Dreams,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Reflections," because
they will come

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
into a rapport with his
energy, and it can release

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:90%
something powerful inside you.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've seen that in
a bibliography so many times

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
in other books.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So many people who are writing
now are tapping in to Jung.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.165 align:middle line:84%
And so we get it through
them, if not directly.

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that your favorite book?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It was my favorite
book about and by Jung,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
which was actually dictated
to one of his associates.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I read
that book in 1972,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
just before I went
to Findhorn, then

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I felt that he was
actually-- his presence

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.590 align:middle line:90%
was in the room with me.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was at a pivotal point
in my spiritual development

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:90%
at that particular point.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to come
in contact with him,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
so I could reclaim and
reopen all the primal aspects

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of myself, and still retain my
spiritual visionary qualities.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.147 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
helped me to do.

00:05:50.147 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you mentioned Findhorn.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, that is so
close to my heart.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I love Findhorn.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And we've mentioned at
different times on the show.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
For people who have not been
there do not know about it,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.435 align:middle line:90%
Findhorn is--

00:05:59.435 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Findhorn is a
pioneering spiritual community

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:90%
in the North of Scotland.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It was written up in the book
"The Secret Life of Plants."

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it
was a garden where

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
the people who live there
cooperated with nature

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
to bring about this
incredible garden of flowers

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables growing in
soils where they were not

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:90%
supposed to grow.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But, when I arrived
there, that was sort of--

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that phase was taken care of.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
The whole community
was a metaphor

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.312 align:middle line:90%
for the growing of souls.

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:28.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:28.112 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a greenhouse where
people became conscious.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And, while I was there, I was
in the performing arts group.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we pioneered
transformational theater.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a
form of drama that

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
helps the audience to have
an associative shifting

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
As you are doing your
drama on the stage,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.328 align:middle line:84%
the whole room goes
to another level.

00:06:46.328 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some people might
wonder why I asked you to do

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%
part of our healing series.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But I believe we can
heal through drama,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
and that is what you're doing.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
That is the original
purpose of it.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
gotten off track now.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's more that meaningful
theater is often too often

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
about sort of permutations of
people's subconscious garbage.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.452 align:middle line:84%
You know, you never
gave me any recognition

00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and you never gave me
the-- that type of stuff.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the roleplaying.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you go on and on into
the labyrinth, which is what--

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>> But, really, the drama--

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
the struggle between the
yes and the no in people

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
should exist to suddenly
have a transcendent release

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
so that there's a fusion within
us, so that all the parts of us

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:90%
become unified.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So the actors should be
unified with the parts

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
they are playing,
with each other

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
on the stage, unified
in consciousness

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
the story's about.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And then this
unifies the audience.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.785 align:middle line:84%
And then, we are restoring
separation to unity.

00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Brings them in.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you are going to
do and some excerpts from--

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I will, actually.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --"UFOs, A Topic."

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> "UFOs."

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> He was a fun guy,
if he was into UFOs.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the play, a Scottish
interviewer asks him-- he says,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:90%
"Did you ever see a UFO?"

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And Jung says, "I had an
interesting experience in 1958.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
From the window of
the tower, I caught

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
sight of two gleaming, metallic,
lens-shaped objects that

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.500 align:middle line:84%
hurtled over the
roof of the house

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and across the lake
in a narrow arc.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
They were UFOs.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Then, another
object came hurtling

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
towards me, a circular lens
with a metallic extension

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:90%
that led to a box.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It stood still in the air,
some 60 or 70 yards away,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
pointing straight at me.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
thought, we always

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
assume that UFOs are
projections of ours.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out that we may
well be their projections.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
This magic lantern-- this UFO
is projecting me, CG Jung.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:46.415 align:middle line:84%
But who or what
manipulates the apparatus?"

00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer says,
"I've often wondered,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:90%
did Jung believe in God?"

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And Jung says, "I
don't need to believe.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I know."

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's powerful.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I like that.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Ah, he was so interesting
in that he connected

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the metaphysical and
the psychological.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And he knew there
was-- to him, he

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
knew also [LAUGHS]
that there was.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
The I Ching was
one of the things

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that he felt that had he
known earlier about it,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
he would have spent
30 years studying it.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm concerned,
Jung was several things.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.600 align:middle line:84%
One, he was a mystic
of the highest order.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:90%
He had expanded consciousness.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
He talks about this--
being able to feel himself

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
in the trees and the lake
and the sky, and so forth.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:90%
That's his expansion.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was a scientist.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And he studied all different
aspects of human behavior.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.855 align:middle line:84%
But, I think he had to
disguise what he was somewhat

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
in the time, to try
to put-- try to put

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
his work in a language that was
acceptable to the world he was

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
working in, as a professional.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But no, from our point of view,
it's easy to see that he was--

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
he was totally over the top.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:90%
He was way ahead of us.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.485 align:middle line:84%
>> What time frame
did he live in?

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I do you believe
it was 1879 to 1961.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I may be off a year or
two, but it's about that.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> About that?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
You have another that
you're going to--

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
the second--

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Another little bit?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Emma Jung is a very
powerful figure in the play.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%
She's a lot of fun.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.847 align:middle line:84%
She has some of the best
zinging lines of the night.

00:10:21.847 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do a little scene
between Jung and Emma.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Jung says, "Every man
carries within him

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:90%
the eternal image of woman.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Not this or that
particular woman,

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:90%
but a definite feminine image."

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And Emma says, "And the
same is true of man.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:90%
She has an inborn image of man."

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Emma says, "And the
same is true of woman.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
She carries an
inborn image of man."

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Animus
within the woman"

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:90%
"Anima within the man."

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Jung says, "Most of what men
say about female eroticism

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and emotion is actually derived
from his own anima projection."

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And Emma says, "And
astonishing assumptions women

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
make about men.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Their fantasies
about godlike heroes

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
are actually projections of
their own heroic element,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
usually onto someone
quite unworthy

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of being the object
of their adoration.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It's their own essence
that is the hero."

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Then Jung says, "Emma, how can
I write with you hovering over

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
my intellect, like
a seagull following

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:90%
a boat looking for scraps?

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Find your own thoughts.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Go and write a book of your own.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I am not your holy grail.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.736 align:middle line:90%
You are."

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:35.708 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:90%
We are going to take a break.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And we will be
right back with more

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
of "Forever Jung," and
"Sociological Aikido,"

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:90%
with John Maxwell Taylor.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
John Maxwell Taylor
heals with drama.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.113 align:middle line:84%
Yes, "Healing With Drama,"
that is the name of the show.

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:54.913 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the programs that
you do is called "Sociological

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Aikido."

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> "Secrets of
Sociological Aikido,

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
the Invisible Art of
Spiritual Self-Defense."

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And how this ties in with
your theme today is that life

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
itself is
improvisational theater.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Every person that we meet
calls a different aspect of us

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
forth to deal with whatever
lines they wing at us.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So we're making it up as--

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.303 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Ken
Wilbur who said recently,

00:12:24.303 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:90%
God is winging it.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're called
upon to do the same.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And what my workshop
is about is being

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
able to make consciousness
for yourself when

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
friction is developing.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that there
are many, many negative people

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
out there in the world--
people who are not

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
moving on the same
wave of transformation

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that you and this
program is about.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And we, who are
working consciously

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to transform
ourselves, often have

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.368 align:middle line:84%
to deal with what I
call energy vampires.

00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I've heard that term before.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
These are people who cannot
get life energy for themselves

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
through their chakras, from the
air, from the food they eat,

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
They need to get it
pre-digested from somebody else.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So they see us, and
they unconsciously

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
will create a
situation where they

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
can-- because energy can
only flow a longer light

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%
correspondence.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
If you were up here and
somebody is negative

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.622 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
get energy from you,

00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:90%
they have to bring you down so--

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to that level, so that
it can fuse with them.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed when
somebody is fractious with you,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
starts an argument,
and then you lose it--

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
the mythical it--
and they walk away

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.925 align:middle line:90%
with a smirk on their face?

00:13:30.925 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like the cat
that just ate the canary.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've had people I know
that have sort of been drawn

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And they would come and they
would tell me everything bad

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
that's going on in their life.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they can walk away
feeling wonderful.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And then I used to be like, ah.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that was happening.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
talking about--

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --people who are drawn to
you because of your light.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And they use your energy.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:90%
That is one scenario.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The other is that they see your
light and they recoil from it,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and try to cancel it
out by withholding

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
their own energy from you,
stealing energy by ignoring.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It says somewhere in
the Bible, I believe,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
being themselves obscure,
they endure no light.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is the situation
is, when we feel that shift

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:84%
in the dynamic of
the room around us,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
by doing certain
centering exercises,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
by grounding ourselves in the
earth and trying to feel all

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of our body, all of our
mind, and all of our emotions

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously-- our emotional
nature, the three bodies--

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%
bang.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The tension of the
situation can create

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
a fusion within ourselves that
makes a very rooted sense.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It's almost if your spine become
like a steel rod around which

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:90%
your energy magnetizes.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're in such a
state that your intuition

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
will suddenly receive
exactly the thing

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to say to clear
up that situation.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking for is to
try to have reconciliation

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You're affirming,
they're denying.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:90%
You want reconciliation.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Now you can do this by looking
in the soul eye of a person.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
One person's eye
reflects the soul.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The other reflects
the personality.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you look
into the soul eye,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.798 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be able to draw
that their essence out.

00:15:03.798 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
the personality eye,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
you're sending a
message that says uh-uh.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You put that false
personality aspect of them

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.357 align:middle line:84%
on hold for a second while you
reach in and pull out the soul.

00:15:14.357 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And you have a fusion with them.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
level of connecting.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a different
way of connecting, yes.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're asking
us to be conscious--

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Conscious.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --about the way we are
feeling, how we're reacting,

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
the energy around us, and
how we're handling that.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And hold our field-- because
if we don't, we're not living

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and demonstrating that all this
consciousness transformation

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
stuff is so wonderful.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can get
blown out of the--

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:84%
just over by a negative
force of somebody

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
who's not working
consciously on themselves,

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that means we've not yet come
to a level of self-mastery that

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is demonstrating the value
of what we're talking about.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So I believe in organic
self-transformation,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that we root ourselves
in the body, the mind,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.235 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions, feel
the soul within it,

00:15:55.235 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and connect with the Earth.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And then we have all the help.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.187 align:middle line:84%
We've got support from below
and support from above.

00:16:00.187 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And it meets here in the middle,
and then we radiate that out.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So we come back into balance,
is basically what it is.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But you say then, there's
a wonderful energy flow

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:90%
that stays within us.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Some people probably have
never thought of that.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, you've sort of
awakened a little idea

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
with this energy vampire,
which is one way to say it.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But it is where you are
uncomfortable in someone else's

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:90%
energy, and you don't know why.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> There is a shift.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a shift.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It can mean that their chakras
are shut down, that they

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:90%
have emotional armor on that--

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and many of their things
in the past history

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
can cause a person to
be the way they are.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're still dealing
with the divine being.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do
is to try to neutralize

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
the imaginary pictures the
person has of themselves

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and you, which they tried to
stick you with, by the way.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we don't have an
immediate reaction to that

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and fall into personality
behavior ourselves--

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
false personality
behavior-- then, there's

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:90%
a momentary gap is created.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment there,
by remembering ourselves,

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
there can be a fusion with
our ordinary consciousness

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:90%
and the real eye--

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that which is within
us all the time, which

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
is permanent and perfect
within all of us,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
but which we are asleep
to most of the time.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.942 align:middle line:84%
>> And you say then, we know
exactly what we need to say.

00:17:13.942 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we've come back
to center, and so our--

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.185 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --intuition can flow
to us and through us.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I have to say this
at the outset.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not done with the head.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
world of talking heads.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The center of gravity
of 90% of the human race

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
now is centered up
here, in the head.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.118 align:middle line:84%
So we need to center in
here and in the heart,

00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and root ourselves--
and the stomach.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Root ourselves
down in the earth.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that where we
feel it, the upset?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it come in the solar
plexus and the heart?

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Gets you through
the solar plexus.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.135 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're in
that negative energy,

00:17:44.135 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%
that's what you listen to?

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You have that sudden
gone-- if you fall into it,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
the delusion, you have this
gone feeling in your stomach.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And all your magnetism
flies away into the night.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you remember and come
to presence within yourself,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:84%
then not only your positive
magnetism goes back

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to the center, the
positive energy

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
underlying their negativity
flies to you, as well.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, you eat
the situation alive.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
When I see a troublemaker
coming, I think, oh, good.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Here comes lunch.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] And you call this
"The Secrets of Sociological"--

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
"Secrets of
Sociological Aikida."

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a seminar I teach, and
I have audiotapes about it.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
finish my book on it

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:90%
and get that out next year.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:90%
But I have wonderful results.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
When people come to my workshops
and I'd pair off with them

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and show them how to do this--

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll have somebody
get on the stage

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and insult me and show how
it doesn't affect me, at all.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll show everybody in
the audience how to do that.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.912 align:middle line:84%
I don't have them
insult one another.

00:18:37.912 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But they'll just say negative
things like worms, death,

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:90%
income tax, and so forth.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's water--

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter to them.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're hearing it,
but it doesn't have a triggering

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:90%
response mechanism.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So you don't lose
emotional power.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And people feel this building
up inside of themselves.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.982 align:middle line:90%
And I get wonderful feedback.

00:18:53.982 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Months after, people
say, you know,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I still use that every day.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And it works with my boss.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:90%
It works with my kids.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.067 align:middle line:84%
Would Jung have
approved of this?

00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, I believe so.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But he was a master
of this, himself.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Joe Henderson, who wrote the
book "Man and His Symbols,"

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
said to me, of
Jung, that when he

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
met Jung he had
the impression came

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:90%
to him with tremendous force--

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
this man is the
living embodiment

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of what a human
being can become.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the charged up energy
field that Jung inhabited.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we're
all meant to be.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to
be on every level.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
go, as Yogananda once

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
said, to stand unshaken amidst
the crash of falling worlds.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Worlds are falling out
there because people are not

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:90%
making the paradigm shift.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
People who can't make that,
the tension is unbearable.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be
strong and rooted,

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
so that we can, with
our subtle energy field,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
influence those in our
immediate environment

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to come in harmony
with the spirit.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You have another thought from
Jung that you will share with

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Another thought, yes.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is beautiful.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:90%
This is about--

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.502 align:middle line:84%
>> This Jung's
summation of love.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It comes towards the end of--

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess I don't need
the pipe for this.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> He's all smoked
out by this time.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Love bears all things.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Love endures all things.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing more can be said.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We are, in a sense, the victims
and the instruments of a love

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
we cannot grasp.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And, yet, we are at its mercy.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:90%
For we cannot live without it.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
We may rebel.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:90%
We may assent.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, we are
always enclosed by it.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Any man with a grain of
wisdom will lay down his arms

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and surrender to it--

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
an act of humility,
an act of subjection.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Name it what you
will, such an act

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
will be testimony to
our freedom to choose

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:03.224 align:middle line:90%
between error and truth.

00:21:03.224 --> 00:21:06.668 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.668 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The essence of
the man's message.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how has
this affected you,

00:21:12.407 --> 00:21:15.115 align:middle line:84%
sharing this over and
over and over again?

00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, somebody once asked
me how I felt when I came off

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:18.727 align:middle line:90%
stage.

00:21:18.727 --> 00:21:20.185 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
said, integrated.

00:21:20.185 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That is what it is about.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's about integrate-- to accept
every aspect of ourselves,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
so that the core of
undifferentiated self

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
around which the whirlwind of
personality activity revolves

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:90%
is present to us all the time.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.616 align:middle line:84%
See, I even talk like Jung
when I'm not being him now.

00:21:39.616 --> 00:21:40.416 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, his individuation--
is that path--

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that is what he called
our own personal growth?

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> He wouldn't have put
it quite in those terms,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:90%
but that's what it leads to.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And Jung, like
any great teacher,

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.630 align:middle line:84%
will speak to every
individual in a personal way

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:84%
according to their
particular needs.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is to just
open ourselves up and want

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to know the secret
core of ourselves,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and to live in harmony
with all the varied--

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
isn't it wonderful
that life is so varied,

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:84%
like the piano keyboard
that has the black notes.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't a symphony be awful
if it was all white notes?

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.053 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:22:21.053 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So there are the black notes
in there with the white ones.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And together, it makes this
wonderful sound that we love.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the same with us.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to play
off the notes of ourselves,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
so that it creates a wonderful
harmony of the whole.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And then we have the end of it.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%

We are actors on a
stage, are we not?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Life is a drama.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we can heal with life's
drama, how wonderful how

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that can help us
to live in balance.
