00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.537 align:middle line:84%
I'm Georgia
Shakti-Hill and I want

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to welcome you today to "Living
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.610 align:middle line:84%
This is our healing series and,
oh, what fascinating topics.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Aromatherapy is what we
will be discussing today.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And we'll be talking about it.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it might be modern as
an alternative medicine,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:90%
but it is ancient in its use.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Come join us today "Living
in Balance on Shakti-Hill."

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.255 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Candace Welsh, is
the "Oil Lady."

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And aromatherapy
is what she does.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.366 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Georgia.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.602 align:middle line:90%
>> It is wonderful to have you.

00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking so much about
essential oils and aromatherapy

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and the medicinal qualities.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to get to
share this with our audience.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
excited about that.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You are labeled the "Oil
Lady" and you're proud of it.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I am.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It's where I belong.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:90%
But your background is diverse.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And you have a personal
story that brought you--

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
almost a miracle
and self-healing.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
was aromatherapy.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
You needed a journey to
find out how could Candace

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:90%
be well again.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And to find out where
I'm supposed to be.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
All that goes along
with it, I think.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And so tell us a little
bit about your story

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and the wonders of aromatherapy.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was executive vice
president and sales manager

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
of a large real estate company.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And through years of stress
and different things,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I just ended up in a lot of
physical pain-- you know,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
frozen shoulder,
headaches, entrapped nerve.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point where
trying to work through the pain

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:90%
wasn't working anymore.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was out searching
for everything.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I had always been very
attuned to physical exercise,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and nutrition, and rest.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like with those three
things we should be healthy,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
but I had some other
lessons to learn.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And the pain got to
the point physically

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:90%
where I needed to stop working.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was out
searching even while I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
was working with doctors and a
lot of other things just trying

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to get out of pain and
get my energy back.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But I needed to stop working
to give myself time to do that.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And while I was out searching,
one of the things I came across

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
was aromatherapy.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a true aromatherapy
massage from someone

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:90%
from England.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And this was about 10 years ago.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And the minute I
touch the oils, it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
brought this incredible
sense of comfort to me.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, what is this?

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I have to learn.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it and it works.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it and it works.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So it got me through
all the tension.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
having two operations

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
during this time period.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And without them, I'm just
not too sure whether--

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I feel like they saved my life.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
They calmed the physical
tissue of your body because

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
of their anti-inflammatory
properties.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
They calm your emotions because
of the nose-brain connection.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So they work on us through
all the different properties

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I went off studying,
just learning for myself.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I set up my laboratory.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I went to
England and learned

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and started journaling
and learning.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
kept like going out,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:90%
classes around my kitchen table.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.695 align:middle line:90%
And now we're a real company.

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's really exciting
because you have become--

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
from the successful
executive who

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
had the stress-related
illnesses to the healer.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And that is your role.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're really a
part of this whole idea

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
of we can take responsibility,
and we can be empowered,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:90%
and we can heal ourselves.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's often our
difficulties that get us

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
to that place.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, without
the difficulties

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I had I never would have
found essential oils.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.242 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel like I was
born to do what I'm doing now.

00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I never would have
been out searching

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
if I hadn't been in pain.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So pain is a great motivator.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell people,
if they think they're out

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
of balance, just go with it.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if they'll go with
it and search with it,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:90%
it will truly be a blessing.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It will take you where
you're trying to go.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:10%
And without that difficulty, or
discomfort, or whatever it is,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't get force to
go out and find your river.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And once you get in your
river, it just takes you.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And you know it.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
And it's like then
you really resonate.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So for you, it is the oils.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's then you were willing
to just take the time just

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
to find out everything that
you needed to know about it.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
You went to school to be a
licensed massage therapist

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
so that could be a
part of the healing.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And then as you learned,
everything just sort of

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
fell into place and
it made sense to you?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever feel like
there was ever a struggle.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like anything
I've ever determined

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
was going to be something I
was going to set up and do.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It just kept happening.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a chart
about the reason it works

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
scientifically.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And you said the
olfactory sense,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:90%
it's an idea of touch and smell.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And tell us a little about that.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There's two main
reasons essential oils work

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:90%
as medicine.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.918 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they were
our origin of medicine.

00:05:08.918 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
origins of perfume,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
because the liquid
happens to smell.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But if the liquid
didn't smell, it still

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
has antibacterial,
antiviral, some

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:90%
have antifungal properties.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So they are liquid
medicine for the skin

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and for the physical tissue.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.575 align:middle line:84%
Then the idea that it
smells, and it smells--

00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
there's a stronger,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
purer smell than true
high-grade essential oils.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And that smell is what works
on through the nose-brain.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So essential oils
work on us mainly

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
because of the
nose-brain connection

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and because of skin absorption.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we're rubbing them
on the body with a base oil,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
they will go into the skin.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But what's so
fascinating, and continues

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to fascinate me
and always will--

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
it's just miracle after
miracle is what happens

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
with the power of smell.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we smell something,
just to pick up and smell,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.685 align:middle line:84%
the smell molecules are
coming out of whatever

00:06:01.685 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:90%
it is we're smelling.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it's
wonderful essential oils.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And the molecules pick
up and go up the nose

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to the olfactory neurons which
are the nerve cells of smell

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:90%
system, the olfactory system.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
The molecules go up
to our olfactory bulb,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:90%
which is up between the eyes.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a track that
goes directly to the brain.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And the nerve cells take
these smell molecules

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:90%
right into the brain.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
So of the five senses--

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
this conference I
was at in England,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
they were saying our nose
is simply a passage way.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The true organ of
smell is the brain,

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.058 align:middle line:84%
because there's a direct
track to the brain.

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's the part
of the brain that's

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the limbic system, which is
our most primitive brain,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
the emotional brain.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So when it goes to the
limbic system, that's

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
why it triggers this
thought or it triggers

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.393 align:middle line:84%
this emotion that we
don't get to decide

00:06:49.393 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
what we want to think
when we smell something,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.570 align:middle line:90%
it just comes in.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it is
almost instantaneous,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter of a second
or two from the time we smell

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
it until we respond?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra said
a while ago that it

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
changes our body chemistry
in less than a hundredth

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
of a second.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when it shoots
to the limbic system,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
it hits the hypothalamus,
which is the brain's brain.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's connected to the
pituitary gland, the master

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
gland of the endocrine system,
master gland of the body.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.917 align:middle line:84%
So that changes the brain's
juices or the neuropeptides

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and the neurochemicals that
are coming out and affecting

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:90%
the tissue.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is
scientifically based.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:90%
But it is also ancient.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The history of aromatherapy
is as old as man.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's beautiful.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
As long as there were
plants on the earth,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
there was essential oils,
because they come out

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of some part of a
plant or a tree.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Like the lavender comes out
of the flowers of lavender.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Peppermint comes
out of the leaves.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Sandalwood comes
out of the wood.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So they are this
encapsulated liquid

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
that's very intense in a plant.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
They're too strong even to
travel around in the plant.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
They're held in these
little oil sacs.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen them under
a microscope at my Purdue

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:90%
University course.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And just to see
the oils in there,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the steam
bursts the oils

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
out when they're
steam distilled.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we get that liquid
concentrated at the end.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's like nature
giving us the liquid

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that's in her to be a
part of medicine for us.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We also mentioned
rubbing them into the skin.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:90%
And you like the jojoba oil?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I do like the jojoba.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I worked with about eight or
10 different vegetable and nut

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
oils, which we would
classify all as base oils.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
The essential oils are the
pure essences-- lavender,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
peppermint, tea tree,
eucalyptus, orange.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
To apply them to
the skin, we need

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to mix them with a base oil
because they're so strong.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
And some of them could burn
the skin if put on directly.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered jojoba,
I stopped using the vegetable

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:90%
and nut oils.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They will go rancid eventually.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Jojoba is actually a liquid wax.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not an oil.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's cold pressed from the
brown bean of a desert plant.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of the best
jojoba in the world

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
comes from our country in
Arizona and California.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And do you know?

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I have talked
with massage therapists about,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and doctors, too, is the idea
that we forget that the skin is

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the largest organ of the
body and that you do directly

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:90%
absorb through the skin.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a
wonderful healing

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
to use the oils in that way.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And jojoba has a
natural affinity

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:90%
with the sebum in our skin.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's loaded
with antioxidants.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's really food for the
skin and it's very silky

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:90%
when you put it on your skin.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It goes right in.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect carrier
for essential oils.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And it will not go rancid.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, essential
oils can last for lifetimes.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And aromatherapy
is worldwide.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And you were honored
by being asked

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of a
book that was created,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
an anthology of aromatherapy,
and you wrote a chapter.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It was created by the
National Association

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:90%
of Holistic Aromatherapists.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are about 30 of
us from around the world

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:90%
that each contributed a chapter.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very unique
book, because you

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
get this broad overview of how
all these different people that

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
have worked with oils for years
happened to see their focus.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And your focus is
the medicinal qualities

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
of the oils?

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.580 align:middle line:84%
My focus is taking something
that's very complex

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:90%
and making it very simple.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
In my laboratory, I have
about 60 to 70 oils,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
but I teach mainly
five because I

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
see them as such wonderful
medicine, physical medicine

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and emotional medicine,
that people should have

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
those five in their household
with their toothbrush,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and their aspirin, and whatever
other things they have there

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.855 align:middle line:90%
and use them on a daily basis.

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going
to talk about that

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
because you've created, then,
what your favorite five are

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:90%
in a Medicine Tin.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through each of those five

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:84%
essential oils and what effect
they can have on the body

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and how they can have that
effect almost immediately.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You also told me that
you have a wonderful mist

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
that one can use.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've used the
one for the airplane.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have a little
package that goes with that.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And also one other thing
which I can't wait to use

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.643 align:middle line:84%
is the natural insect
repellent, too.

00:11:10.643 --> 00:11:12.935 align:middle line:84%
So you really are a little
scientist in there creating,

00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:90%
are you not?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it was all
things I created for me.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
The medicine started in
a little plastic baggie

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.625 align:middle line:90%
with a paper towel for me.

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And then it went through
all these evolutions

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
to where it is now.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And the airplane regimen
started out for me

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
because I was getting
sore throats and cold.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So as things come up,
now I get to the point

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:84%
when something's coming
up new with me, I go,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess I need to
learn about this now.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And it will serve others.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So then I get it
there and create.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.437 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take a break.

00:11:39.437 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back,
let's go through the oils.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about how they
serve us well, as you do, too.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.046 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll stay tuned, we'll
be right back with Candace.

00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:51.022 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Candace Welsh is the Oil Lady.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And the subject is aromatherapy.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose is
self-healing and how

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
you can use the
essential oils and be

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:90%
self-empowered by doing that.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you've created
is the Medicine Tin.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about those five oils

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that you say all
of us could use.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And it would be like the basics.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
This would be
wonderful for starters.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And we should have
them all in our home.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
find about aromatherapy

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is it's very
confusing to people,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
because there are
hundreds of oils.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
There are well over
400 essential oils.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And when people
start to hear about it,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
experiment with it,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the tendency is to go out and
buy a lot of oils and then kind

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
of not know what
to do with them.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I like to take it
and keep it very simple.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The five oils that I
think are the basic five

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that help us on a daily basis
are what I've put together

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and put it in a way
where people don't need

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:90%
me to make up blends for them.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The Medicine Tine of five oils
with the base oil of jojoba

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and the lavender mist is
designed so that people

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.690 align:middle line:90%
can take care of themselves.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:84%
They can open the tin up and put
the oils out on their dresser,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
put the lid out on the
dresser with the oils in it.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they make
up in their hand what

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
they need when they need it.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And I told you I carry
lavender with me all the time.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about the qualities
of lavender, what that is for,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
how that helps us.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the essential oils,
lavender is the most universal,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
the most versatile, and the
most acceptable to the largest

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
number of people.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely balancing to
the central nervous system.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And the nickname I give
it is the balancer.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Each oil has its
own little nickname.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And lavender is the balancer.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Just by smelling
out of the bottle,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
we can balance the
central nervous system

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and help balance the
rhythms of the body almost

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
If we're very nervous or if
we've been through something

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
very traumatic,
like a car accident,

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
just amazing things will
happen to get the lavender

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
right to your nose and
just breathe it in.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So as an inhalant, it will help
get right to the limbic system

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and help balance the
central nervous system.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You've also created--

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in addition to lavender
being a part of this--

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:84%
you have Lavender Penny
and the Lavender Pillows,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:90%
is that right?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> A little Lavender Penny
Bear and a Lavender Pillow.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And both the bear and the
pillow have a little bottle

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
of pure, high-grade
lavender with them

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
so that if someone just needs
that comfort of lavender,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it can be tapped on the
pillow or tapped on the bear,

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and kept on their bed, or
traveled with, or as a gift

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to someone who's in the
hospital, or not feeling well,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:90%
or been through some grieving.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just a tremendous comfort.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:90%
So lavender is the balancer.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're always talking
about staying in balance,

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
living in balance.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.445 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
way that we can

00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:90%
is keep our lavender with us.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that I
use, my first medicinal oil

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:90%
that I use is tea tree.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And I always have that with me.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I told you I couldn't
find mind this morning,

00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, no.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But tea tree oil is
wonderful for what?

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Specifically for red
ant bites, mosquito bites,

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
bee stings, anything that
can form a little infection,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:90%
a little nodule.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of the oils we
don't use straight

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
on our skin at any time.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The exception to that is
lavender and tea tree.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Lavender is fantastic
for burns and cuts

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's anti-inflammative
and antibacterial.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Tea tree has those
same properties.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, it's
antiviral and antifungal.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So if we get bitten by a
bee or any kind of insect,

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and we've got that sting
and that possible site

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.517 align:middle line:84%
of infection, that's when we'll
get a drop on it straight.

00:15:38.517 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just wonderful.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.828 align:middle line:84%
>> And I did mention chiggers,
which some people might be

00:15:41.828 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
aware of in different
parts of the country.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
When we go to our
North Carolina place,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.895 align:middle line:84%
that's major to have your
tea tree oil to combat it.

00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
also said that you

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
did create that
mist of citronella

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
and some other things, too.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're moving
through the tea tree.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So tea tree-- antibacterial,
antiviral, antifungal.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very powerful.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So used as medicine,
one drop straight

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:90%
would be for a site, a spot.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we have a cold, it's
also internal infections,

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
then we'd pour the jojoba
in the palm of our hand,

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
add one drop of tea
tree, and then we've

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
made our palm blend
to apply to the nose,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
rub the hands together,
go around the ears,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
go to the chest and help any
kind of respiratory infection

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:90%
that we have, colds and flu.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And then peppermint.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Peppermint, and that is
also one that I've been told

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
has many wonderful
uses, even energizing.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They say you can
use it in your car

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're driving long distances
and it will invigorate you

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%
as you drive.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Peppermint, I think is a
little hidden jewel of an oil

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a common
sense to us and taste to us

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
that we don't often think
of it in a pure state

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:90%
as an essential oil as medicine.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But it has a wonderful ability
to revitalize the mind,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
clear the mind,
clear the sinuses,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and wonderful for digestion.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
I call it the number
one digestion oil.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true, oh.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> For belly rubs.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.685 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:06.685 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful for digestion.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an upset
stomach or something, even just

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.843 align:middle line:84%
the inhaling of it would
be as effective as taking

00:17:13.843 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
some peppermint or
something internally.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
The inhaling out of the
bottle is always good.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.775 align:middle line:84%
And then, especially, if
you want to clear the mind

00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're driving, or
you're sluggish, or you lose

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.988 align:middle line:84%
focus on something
you're working on--

00:17:24.988 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when I'm
writing and I lose

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
focus, I pick up the peppermint,
just take those deep breaths.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to put it
on your body like a belly

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
rub for a stomach ache, then
you pour the jojoba in your palm

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and you add one
drop of peppermint.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.667 align:middle line:84%
And then again, you've made your
healing salve and just enough

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:90%
for what you need at the moment.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Rub the tub.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And apply some to the
nose first to make

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
the nose-brain connection
and then go to the belly.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Eucalyptus, tell us about that.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to have
eucalyptus around you

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
in your home, but in an
oil, how does one use it?

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:90%
For what reasons?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Eucalyptus would be
the oil of respiration,

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
wonderful for any
breathing, opening up

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
the sinuses, any
congestion in the head

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
and the respiratory track.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, just inhaling
out of the bottle,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't ever want
to underestimate

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:90%
the power of inhaling.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And then if we want to apply
it to the nose, or the ears,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
the neck, the
chest, just like we

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
used to do with
Vicks VapoRub, we

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:90%
apply the jojoba in our hand.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And we just need to pour
enough jojoba to fill up

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
the well of your hand.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:90%
And then you add one drop.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And the oil and the oil
comes in the European bottles

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:90%
with the droppers in them.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
So only one drop will come out.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, you've
made up your healing salve

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.165 align:middle line:84%
to do the chest rub with,
put on your T-shirt.

00:18:42.165 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Put it on the
soles of your feet.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Put your socks on and go to
bed and just let the eucalyptus

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:90%
work on your system.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And see again, then, we have
to remember that the skin is

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that organ through
which we can absorb.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So you use both the inhaling
and then also on the body.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And then orange,
wonderful orange.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Wonderful orange, the
natural tranquilizer.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Very sweet, warming,
nurturing, very soothing,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:90%
again, it's antibacterial.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So all the oils are reinforcing
a healthy immune system.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
They all have
antibacterial properties.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But orange is
wonderful for stress.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It would be a second or addition
to stress oil with lavender,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
wonderful used
together or by itself,

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and a great children's oil, too.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit about
the airplane and lavender

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you do now, because
that's one of the ways that I

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
do use the lavender, because
we do have to ward off

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria and things and
viruses that we could get as we

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
so much to people.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a little
airplane regimen,

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
because I was tired of getting
sore throats and colds on every

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:90%
trip.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So I have the
lavender mist which

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.708 align:middle line:90%
I make up in my laboratory.

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it has the
properties of lavender

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
to soothe and
soothe the emotions

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
as well as keep the
skin antiseptic.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I mist with the lavender
throughout the flight

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
whenever I want to.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it just clears
all that heavy, slow

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
feeling we get from
the airplane air that's

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
just constantly
being turned over

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.835 align:middle line:90%
and losing oxygen all the time.

00:20:12.835 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I told you I mist my husband
whether he likes it or not when

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:90%
we travel by plane.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But also you told me
before that in Europe, they

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:84%
have used lavender in
hospitals for years.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:90%
So this--

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> To clean the air.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:90%
To clean the air again.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So after I mist
several times,

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
then I'm keeping my lavender
and my peppermint oils with me.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.115 align:middle line:84%
And I'll breathe
the lavender now

00:20:36.115 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and then to clear
the nasal passage.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'll breathe the
peppermint at the same time.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And if people happen
to get nervous flying,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
the lavender is wonderful
soothing to the nerves.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And if they get travel
sickness, the peppermint's

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
wonderful for that to settle
than the nauseated feeling.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But aside from that,
just to breathe

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.825 align:middle line:84%
would be to help keep
the nasal passage clear

00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and keep your breathing
healthy so you're not

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
picking up the germs.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> This is absolutely wonderful.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm so appreciative.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have the Medicine Tin
that you have put together,

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
which is our own little
self-healing technique.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You have been a part of a
"World of Aromatherapy."

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a tape that
explains how we use this.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So the Oil Lady,
this is wonderful.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it gives people the
ability to help themselves

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and then they help their
family and their friends.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.885 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
way to get it out.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And also as a licensed
massage therapist,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
you include this as
part of the regimen.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what a gift you
are in sharing that.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate your
sharing the wisdom

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and the light with us
in this healing series.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.370 align:middle line:84%

tuned, we will give you

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.272 align:middle line:84%

"Living in Balance
on Shakti-Hill"

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%
is about self-healing.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Aromatherapy is a
wonderful technique.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And it is so easy.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Just start with the
simple, with the lavender,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
with the eucalyptus, the
peppermint, the orange,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
the tea tree oil.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Just try and see
how you, too, can

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
learn to live in balance
using aromatherapy.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, may you be
well, happy, and peaceful.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.
