00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.950 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome
you to "Living in Balance."

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.560 align:middle line:10%
We are going on a journey today.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And this journey,
we will go back

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred and
ancient teachings

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.340 align:middle line:90%
of the Incas and the Mayas.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Aluna Joy is an expert in the
field of ancient teachings

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of the Incas and the Mayans.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I am so pleased to
have her with us today.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:90%
How did you become an expert--

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
ah, the teachings of the
ancient sacred teachings?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if
anybody is an expert.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.598 align:middle line:84%
But I've had quite a
few experiences there

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and I've spent quite a
bit of time in those lands

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.397 align:middle line:84%
with the people of
those traditions.

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is the gift
that you're sharing.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
start with Machu Picchu

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have heard about it.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really just kind
of wanted to know, as far

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
as the feeling,
the resonance, it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
is one of the sacred
sites on the planet.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that people
are being awakened there

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
as they go on these journeys.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little
bit about Machu Picchu.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not only is it one
of the most beautiful sites.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It has probably the
most sweetest energy

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of any sacred site
I've ever been to.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It's surrounded by
three sacred mountains.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
One's called Apu Machu Picchu,
which isn't a surprise.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.543 align:middle line:84%
Another one is
Apu Huayna Picchu,

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's the one
most people are

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the
photographs of Machu Picchu.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the third is Apu Putacusi,
and that's my favorite.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:90%
The three surround the site.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.425 align:middle line:84%
And inside, it makes
a triangle of energy.

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you sit
inside the site,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
it holds a frequency that
helps a person access parts

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
of themselves that they
wouldn't normally if they

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:90%
were on the streets of LA or--

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So the energy is what
is the powerful draw.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
But you're calling
it a sacred site.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
What makes it sacred?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Sacred site-- a sacred
site is a place where people

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
for generations have
done sacred ceremony,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
have worked on
spiritual awakening.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you do something
on a piece of earth,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the energy of that experience
absorbs into the land,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and then it builds
and builds and builds.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu has been used for
three ages, Lemuria, Atlantis,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:90%
and this age.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that very
clearly in the stonework there.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we talk about
the Inca sacred teachings.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was a site
that the Incas also

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:90%
blessed and made sacred.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The teachings that
you've shared--

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at your
website and I just loved it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.233 align:middle line:84%
because there was so much
really good information,

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and also your newsletter that
comes out on a regular basis.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how I first
met you was by email.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I really
was anxious to meet,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
who is this woman who travels so
much and has so many incredible

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:90%
adventures?

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But in the Incas' sacred
teachings, we start first--

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and this sounds a little bit
like Western philosophy, too--

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
know thyself, or know the self
and overcome negative egos.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
That is a major
teaching of the Incas.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> That is not unlike
what we do ourselves--

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --in Western philosophy.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Inca three steps.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
There's three steps to mastering
the self or becoming a master.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
connected to Buddhism

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
because the ancient stories
link the Andean people

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
to the people of the Himalayas.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There's old ancient
stories that link that.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But the first step is
probably the most powerful

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
because you have
to master the soul.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand who you
are and understand what is you

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and what's not you.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.315 align:middle line:84%
And the egos are considered
illegal passengers

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:54.115 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And my Inca friends say
you need to boot them out.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a series of
what are called the negative

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%
egos.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're exactly
like the deadly sins.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
like the Bible.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:10%
And those are lust, laziness,
gluttony, envy, pride, anger,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:10%
greed.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:10%
So do you mean mankind,
no matter what culture

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:10%
we've been in, we've all been--

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:10%
>> We're all talking
about the same thing.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Have the same issues
that we're dealing with.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So all these arguments we have
between religions and cultures

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
saying, we're
right, you're wrong,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
is just really
rather ridiculous.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look
at the root of all that,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the same thing.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we go back to
these sacred Inca teachings,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
the three step-- know the self
and overcome negative egos,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and then master the
Kundalini energy.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Now the Kundalini energy
we think of as Hindu.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:90%
But this is also Inca?

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Kundalini
energy is what?

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the energy
that runs up the spine.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And the root of it is in the
root chakra of your system.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring
that up and bring it

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:84%
all the way up and around
like a serpent over the head,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
it helps you awaken to
your full potential.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the Incas
believe you were

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
born with 3% of
full consciousness

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
alive in your mind.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is sort of
a seed in which you

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.207 align:middle line:90%
need to water to grow.

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And all the rest of
that consciousness

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
is doing all kinds of things,
like, I'm afraid of this.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I want that, all the ego things.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So 97% is not--

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Is off doing--

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --on target?

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> 97% is out there
for us to master.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
The 3% is what we
find and discover

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.882 align:middle line:84%
when we go inside really deep,
maybe sitting in a sacred site,

00:05:35.882 --> 00:05:37.465 align:middle line:84%
and we touch a place
inside of ourself

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
where there's total
peace and love

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.563 align:middle line:84%
and you feel one
with everything.

00:05:40.563 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's where you build from.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Ah, OK, so that is
mastering the Kundalini energy.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And then thirdly, the
third step in the process,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.563 align:middle line:84%
offer sacred service and
live from unconditional love.

00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's beautiful,
and that's exactly what

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:90%
we're teaching today.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back to the
ancient times of the Incas?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So it is universal, is it not?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>> You have some beautiful
photographs from Machu Picchu

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:10%
with angelic beings.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about those.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:10%
And you said the artist is whom?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, the angel
artist is Karen Howie,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:10%
and she wrote a book and also
illustrated a book called

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:10%
"Angels, Guardians of the
Light," published by Hay House.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And we've been collaborating.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.843 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
multimedia slideshows.

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm looking
at the monitor now,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%
and that is absolutely gorgeous.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have
blended the angels with--

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> With photographs that I've
taken over the years in Machu

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Picchu.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:10%
And you scan them
into the computer,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:10%
and we have these great
programs now where

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:10%
you can actually layer images
together to help people,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:10%
when they look at
the images, help

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:10%
feel the impact of
those sites as you would

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:10%
if you were sitting there.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
one is Ollantaytambo,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
a sacred valley where
the ancient mystery

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:90%
schools are anchored.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can really feel the
angelic presences there.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the reasons why I
put those two images together.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And so we're talking then
about the ancient mystery

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:90%
schools.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So again we're back
to the initiations,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the souls
are awakened to their purpose.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I liked that third
step, offer sacred service

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and live from
unconditional love.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
that all the time.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:90%
What is our gift?

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:90%
How can we serve?

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
What is it we're here
on the Earth to do?

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But love is always a component
in there, too, is it not?

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's unconditional.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That means giving without
expecting anything back,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
giving because you love to
give, and allowing others

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to give to you.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's also
the temple of the heart.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And you said that is part
of the Incan teachings too.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually there's two parts.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
The temple of the heart is here.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And our father
wisdom, mother temple.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's the father, mother.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
see it as male, female,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's still called
father, mother.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.633 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is you
use the two together.

00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
problem up here,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm feeling jealous
or I'm feeling angry,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
you bring it down
into the heart.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is the place
where the fire burns.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The fire that's the piece
of God that's inside of you.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And you give it back to God.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.752 align:middle line:84%
You know how we say
let go and let God,

00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:90%
well, this is the Incas' way.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
They take it down from the
mind, put it in the heart,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and then let the
fire there burn it

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
up in what they call a
violet sulfur fire of love

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:90%
from the mother.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So the process,
then, if you are upset

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're into anger, then
you literally think of that

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
as moving, and you literally
bring it down to this point

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.532 align:middle line:84%
so that you can sort
of envision it there.

00:08:39.532 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the heart will take
care of the firing part?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Takes care of the rest.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is cleansing,
then, that happens.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the stone that we
have, tell me about that.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Is this Incan?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it came from
the Inca lands,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
but no one really
knows, at least

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
on an archaeological level,
where they came from.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a stone of Ica.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's from a town called Ica.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It's south of Lima, Peru.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And a man named Dr.
Cabrera in the '50s

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
started discovering these
carved stones in the desert.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's collected
over 11,000 of them.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
more in the earth.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And they've dated them back--

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
considering what's been carved
on them, this is only one

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
of thousands--

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
they were carved at
the age of the dinosaur

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
by beings from a star
system that we don't

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:90%
understand where it is yet.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Now that's part of the
connection with the Incas.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:10%
And when we talk about Peru,
we do talk about the drawings

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:10%
and the lines on the Earth.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And this, then, is--

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.917 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for people
to see up close,

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
but this is then a drawing that
we think goes way back in time

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.385 align:middle line:90%
to the time of the dinosaurs.

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, found very near Nazca.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So there were people
that were here at the time

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:90%
of the dinosaurs.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and this is why the
stones haven't been recognized

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
by the archaeological
community yet,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
because basically it's going to
rewrite the history of the Inca

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and the history of humanity
because it's going to put man

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:90%
with the age of the dinosaur.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are carvings on the
stones with man and dinosaur

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Men riding on the
back of pterodactyls--

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, about 11,000 of these.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now is this then a
sacred stone to you?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I asked you if I could even
hold it, and you said yes.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:90%
But one should because this--

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
tell me about your feeling about
it and how it has impacted you

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:90%
or how you use it.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The stone is actually a
part of a living library.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by a living
library is it's like,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
it's active.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:90%
It learns from you.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
You learn from it.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way library.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.692 align:middle line:84%
We had quite a few
clairvoyants on our pilgrimage

00:10:40.692 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to Peru when we
collected the stone, when

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera actually
allowed us to take one.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And we all separated, and
everyone read it separately.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And we got the same story.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a library.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:10%
It activates things in you
that are already there.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
So I guess it's not a library.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You're the library,
and it tells you

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
how where the index card file
is, and you can access that.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.265 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the key to the library.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:04.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
stones have been in the earth

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
for 65 million years,
and the star elders

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
have been watching the Earth
for a very long time, longer

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:90%
than we can conceive of.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So therefore when
you hold the stone,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.348 align:middle line:84%
the star elders are
updating the libraries.

00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They know where Earth is.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:90%
They know where humanity is now.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.378 align:middle line:84%
>> But we're going
to take a break.

00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:10%
Because we need to
talk about the star

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:10%
elders and also the Mayans.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.784 align:middle line:90%
with more from Aluna Joy.

00:11:30.784 --> 00:11:33.736 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
If you are just
joining us, we have

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
been talking about the ancient
teachings of the Incas.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
switch to the Mayans.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And our guest today, Aluna Joy
Yaxk'in, has authored a book

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:90%
called "Mayan Astrology."

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
part of your gift

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
also, that you're able
to work with the calendar

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayans.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Because we've heard about
the Mayan calendar predicting

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and forecasting shifts in
consciousness on the planet.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.792 align:middle line:90%
What is going on with that now?

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> First off, you have
to understand there's 20

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:90%
calendars.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I work with two.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.328 align:middle line:84%
>> There's prophetic calendars,
and those are the ones that

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
mark out 26,000 or
104,000-year cycles.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.235 align:middle line:84%
And when people talk
about the Mayan calendar

00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:84%
or hear about the Mayan
calendar or the end

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar, they're
talking about the big ones,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:90%
the prophetic ones.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And even though there
is some slight arguments

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
about the exact end
date, the most common one

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
used by even people in
Guatemala is December 21, 2012.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, OK, so that's
the 2012 significance.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
the world ends.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:10%
It means that the
evolutionary intention that

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:10%
was linked to that
cycle of time will shift

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:10%
and will decide to
do something else.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a bigger shift
because it's a bigger cycle,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%
but the calendar never ends.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It continues on and on.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing that you have
created is a Mayan decoder.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Now is that-- for
the layperson who

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
knows nothing about
the Mayan calendar,

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
would this help in an
understanding of it?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Or tell us how
that tool is used.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mayan time decoder
basically takes your Gregorian

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
birthday and shifts it
into a Mayan calendar date.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.767 align:middle line:90%
It is three easy steps.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
It's simple as adding
up a couple of numbers

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.433 align:middle line:84%
and counting on a chart,
and you can come up

00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:90%
with your Mayan birthday.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the book
"Mayan Astrology"

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
will hope you do a whole reading
on what that day means for you.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.247 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your gifts,
your challenges,

00:13:43.247 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
what your preferences
are-- it kind of

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
helps clarify your
destiny and also goes back

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to that first step of the
Inca tradition saying,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.057 align:middle line:90%
know the self.

00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Understand the self.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what did you find was
Aluna Joy's purpose or gifts

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that you were supposed to be
sharing when you did your own?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.537 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, now I'm working
with two calendars.

00:14:01.537 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And in one calendar
I'm seven Kawak.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And the other I'm 10 Kaban.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.192 align:middle line:84%
And 10 Kaban to the Maya
people is a really big deal

00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:09.400 align:middle line:90%
because that's a year bearer.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I went down to the
Maya lands in Guatemala

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.385 align:middle line:84%
and up in the highlands
of Momostenango,

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:84%
they did my date real quick, and
they found out I was 10 Kaban.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And they really
liked that, so they

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
felt OK about sharing
more information.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The seven Kawak is about
bridging heaven and earth

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%
and also transformation.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And basically that's
what my work does.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.285 align:middle line:10%
I've pulled on a lot
of different sources

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of different ideas and
schools of thought and kind of

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:10%
synthesized it into a book
to help people very easily,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:10%
actually, to access at least of
the doorway to their destiny.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the places that
you go, a sacred site, again,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayans that you said
is really your favorite is

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Palenque.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have a beautiful
temple from Palenque.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And you said that is so special.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you traveled
there, tell me about that.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, how is it like
and how is it different

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:90%
from the Incan sacred sites?

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Every site's different.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Every Maya site, every
Inca site, each one

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:90%
teaches something different.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And Palenque?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Palenque is heaven on Earth.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It is?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my favorite place.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a book written called
"He Walked the Americas."

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the stories of Christ
walking through the Americas.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Palenque was one of the
places Christ walked.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.605 align:middle line:84%
The site was never
discovered by the Spanish,

00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
so the energy has
not been destroyed.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that Christ presence,
that really pure,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
sweet, gentle energy
is still there.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It's also a place where the
universal merkaba is connected.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Now you have mentioned
in your writings

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:10%
about the Earth merkaba.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:10%
Now what is that?

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a place--

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:10%
it's an energy grid.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
An energy grid is a place
where certain lines of energy

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
come together at a point.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
even a person that

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't consider themselves
sensitive, when walking across

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:84%
it, would actually feel
either a sense of peace

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of bliss
or exhilaration.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Palenque is a place where
the knowledge of the Earth

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
comes up to a certain point,
and there's a hall of records

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I call it the hall of records.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
anybody else does.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually activated
on December 21 every year

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:90%
when the sun--

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> The solstice.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, winter solstice, when
the sun shines through two

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.778 align:middle line:90%
windows in a three-story tower.

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And it shines down
two beams of light

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
into a place we call
the hall of records.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit there and
allow yourself to open up,

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
you can access the knowledge
that is in your body.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Because every person
has a library.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
Akashic records.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so each person,
when they go there,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
has the ability, then, to
look within their own soul's

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:10%
Is that--

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Their souls, the
Earth, humanity's.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So all the records.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hm.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah, OK.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:10%
So that is really, then, one
of the benefits of traveling

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:10%
to a sacred site, is each
has their own energy,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and then each also can
bring something from within.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:05.889 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we look at this, you
have mentioned before the star

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
elders and their teachings.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:90%
So who are the star elders?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you talk to
the elders in Guatemala,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
they call them the
Invisible Council,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and they'll actually go in and
have meetings with these guys.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
The star elders are a group of
beings who most likely carved

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the Inca stone, who
have been coming back

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and forth to the Earth
many, many times, in times

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
past that we can't even conceive
of they're so far along, so

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
far back, and continue to have
an influence on this Earth.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
They probably anchored
Egypt and Tibet

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.578 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayas and the Incas.

00:17:46.578 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So the drawings that
people are familiar with,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
where we have-- in the ancient
drawings of the astronaut,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.223 align:middle line:84%
this is when the star elders
connected to the Earth.

00:17:55.223 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Are you familiar with those?

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the astronaut
in the Nazca lines.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We're guessing that that's
probably what that is.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And the purpose of the star
elders returning now and going

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
back and forth,
the invisible ones,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and talking with the Mayans,
what information are they

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:90%
sharing?

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What they teach is
the science of ascension

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
or the science of love,
the science of peace.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
When you connect with
them, the sense of love

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.093 align:middle line:84%
is just overwhelming
and the sweetest energy.

00:18:27.093 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to come into
rooms now during conferences

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
where we can actually feel
that presence a little bit.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And they aren't here on
physical form, not yet.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And don't expect them
to back until humanity

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:90%
is ready to not make them gods.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Because once-- imagine if a
being of a very advanced race

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and a very high
spiritual integrity

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.567 align:middle line:84%
walked into this room, you'd
bow and say, I'm not worthy.

00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Follow them around the world and
listen to everything he said,

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.268 align:middle line:84%
and try to play your life
to that person's life.

00:18:57.268 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not what they want
because we have the potential

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.148 align:middle line:84%
to be that amazing
and that brilliant,

00:19:02.148 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and they want that in us.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So they come to
us in our dreams.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
They might be the
little voice saying,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
go this way and not that
way, or pay attention

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.515 align:middle line:84%
to this and not that, along
with your inner guidance.

00:19:14.515 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So on a spiritual
level, then,

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:90%
they are guides that would come.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> They can be.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And are they awakened by
visiting the sacred sites that

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
you might connect with them
because you have been there?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that why the star elders are
connecting with some people,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
because of their connection with
the Incas or with the Mayans?

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It might be.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But anybody watching
us right now

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:84%
can ask to be connected
with them, and they'll come.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.767 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't have to be on
a sacred site to do that.

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But the frequencies
that are held--

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
they're actually visibly-- not
visibly, but measurably higher

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:90%
in sacred sites.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.445 align:middle line:84%
And this is why when
people go there,

00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
they come home and
all of a sudden they

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:90%
notice they're different.

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.652 align:middle line:90%
Their lifestyles change.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
They get rid of stuff
out of their house.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Things come out of their
mouth in a different way.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.807 align:middle line:90%
And their priorities change.

00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:02.307 align:middle line:84%
>> A shift takes place in their
minds and their perspective.

00:20:02.307 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it might
be very subtle, yeah.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the places that is
really sacred to me is Sedona,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Arizona.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And that is where you
have recently moved,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:10%
from Mount Shasta.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Now both of those
are power points.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
They are sacred sites
on the planet too.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We even have a photograph of
Sedona, one of my favorites

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:90%
by Margaret Jackson.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:10%
But you're living there now.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the work
that you're doing now?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
What is your purpose,
and how are you sharing?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
By the traveling and your
taking people to these sites,

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:90%
is that what your job is?

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our work
is about gathering

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
groups that have a spiritual
intent that are wanting to take

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:90%
the next step in their life.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We take small groups, and
we go a few times a year

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to either Peru or
Guatemala or Mexico.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I also write for
several magazines

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and offer free newsletters
off email and working

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
on two other books
that are in the works.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The last thing is in just
a minute or so, as this new

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
millennium is upon us, what
would the ancient teachings

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:90%
tell us now?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, definitely to be
in love and not fear.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
concerned about the fear

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that is building on the planet
because of the millennium.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.435 align:middle line:84%
And they continually
tell me over and over

00:21:22.435 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that fear is the
first thing that

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:84%
will disconnect you from your
intuition and from your spirit.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing to get it
back will be going into love.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Enter the new millennium
with a joyous heart

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
because we're actually
creating what's coming.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And we are then responsible
for bringing the joy

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and the love to the planet,
rather than the fear.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, those
teachings are just

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
like the course in miracles,
or they are like the Bible.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They are really
cross-cultural, again.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:10%
Well I thank you for the
way that you're sharing

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and that you're creating
opportunities for people

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:10%
to connect back to the
Incas and to the Mayans.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And so blessings to you.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like to be in
touch with Aluna Joy and also

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.058 align:middle line:84%
with us, just stay tuned,
and we'll let you know how.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I just love the way
we find how much there

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
is in the universal truth
from culture to culture.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Even if we take the journey
back to the ancient Incas

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Mayans, they are
teaching love and not fear.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
