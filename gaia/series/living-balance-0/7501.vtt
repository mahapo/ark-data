I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,

to "Living in Balance."

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.310 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be
sharing with you a story

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.040 align:middle line:10%
today of an American
doctor who was called back

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.170 align:middle line:10%
to India by his guru.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:10%
The purpose of it
was an initiation.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.370 align:middle line:90%
An amazing story.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:90%

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Donald Schnell
is with us today,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.313 align:middle line:90%
and I'd like to welcome you.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Georgia.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
>> It's wonderful
to have you here,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:10%
and you're going to tell
us a story that is amazing,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:10%
and it's amazing, and that's
a word that I had to use,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:10%
because you took a journey of
adventure and enlightenment

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:10%
to India, and you are
not the same person.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you even
have a new name.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.825 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
call you as your--

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
the chiropractic
doctor, Donald Schnell.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:10%
But your experience
changed you completely,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.052 align:middle line:10%
and you started a
new life in 1997,

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
and you've written
a book about it.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:10%
And the book is called,
"The Initiation."

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.056 align:middle line:10%
>> And your name now
is Prema Baba Swamiji.

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:12.856 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:13.656 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, that I'm sure
has much meaning,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:10%
and if you would explain to us
your name, Prema Baba Swamiji.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm still
called lots of things,

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:90%
but Prema Baba Swamiji--

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Prema is a Sanskrit word for--

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:90%
it means love.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And Baba simply means
father, and Swamiji is

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
a title like rabbi or a priest.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It just means you're
in a sacred order.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:10%
And you were inducted
into this, initiated

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:10%
into this sacred order.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, not everybody
gets to do that.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this was
something very special.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just because
you had been a devotee.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're not sure if it's
an IQ test I failed, you know,

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:90%
or what.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, no, it was
quite a privilege.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:10%
It was an honor.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:10%
I was surprised.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:10%
I certainly felt an urge to go.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
We had just-- my wife
Marilyn and I-- had just

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
finished completing a
tour, and we had just

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
landed into Los
Angeles from Australia,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a calling
from my childhood teacher

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
to go to India.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was determined to
get to India, and in fact,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
did within 48 hours.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
arrived, he said

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.367 align:middle line:90%
to me, what kept you so long?

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Why weren't you here a year ago?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Telepathically, he'd been
inviting you for a year.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.205 align:middle line:10%
>> But you said your
childhood teacher,

00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:10%
so this is something that you
were special in that regard,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:10%
because from the time you were
little you have been spiritual,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:10%
metaphysical.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:10%
You have been also
Eastern oriented.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, he-- yes, very much so.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
My childhood teacher used
to come to me in dreams,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and he used to wave his hand
and would make a candy for me

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:90%
in the dreams.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
would remember him.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up and I'd feel
really very positive.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
He was using positive
reinforcement instead of M&M's.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
He was ahead of the group then.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was many years later
when I would meet him in India

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and recognize him as
my childhood teacher.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was the Swami?

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Nagananda.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Nagananda.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to talk today
about Babaji, because Baba Ji--

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and people will
need to be kind of--

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
an explanation, because Babaji
has been thousands of years,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
perhaps 1,000
years on the Earth?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's-- we're not
really sure historically.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We have some clues.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's in Indian
mythology, it's said

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that he was
initiated by Krishna,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.505 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking at least
5,000 or 6,000 years of history

00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:39.305 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We also know that he
started the Swami order,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that he initiated Shankar, the
founder of the Swami order,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's a good
3,000 years back.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So he's been on the
planet for quite a while.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, if people are not aware
of the philosophies of India,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
this would be
surprising to them,

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
but we have sort of a lineage
of gurus and enlightened beings.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Yogananda, and we

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
do-- you said that the
autobiography of a Yogananda

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:90%
is where you first met Babaji.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And he has--

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:10%
well, tell us a little
bit about the mysteries,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:10%
how you can explain the
mysteries and the wonderments

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:10%
of the gurus from the east?

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's a good question.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And they-- I don't know
that they could be--

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
can be explained.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's some
things that are meant to be

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
beyond the rational mind.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not meant to
be put into a category

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:90%
to allow us to stretch.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience
with the Swamis

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and the various gurus
of India, they always

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
challenged all my
academic learning

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.517 align:middle line:84%
and they took me into
regions beyond the mind,

00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
growth came from.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And they moved me
into the heart,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and certainly as
an American male

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I needed that, because I
was pretty left brained.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.145 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:02.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and I think it's almost
as if someone had said, well,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:10%
you do a lot of show that
include some things about

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:10%
India.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, because there
is so much spirituality there

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:10%
that we can incorporate,
and that people

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:10%
who are on a
spiritual path often

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:10%
find with yoga or
Ayurveda or a guru.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
America has its own
spiritual tradition

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
in the transcendentalist,
and they very much

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:90%
match the Eastern teachings.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, we're
so focused on religion,

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the
West that we don't

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
hear spirituality or
spiritual messages,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, when
we look to India,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
for example, they're not so hung
up on the religious aspects.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you get
these spiritual gems

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that are very universal
that apply to everybody.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And they go--

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it
easier in that sense.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.975 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we don't
have them in the West.

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just hard to define.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and you--

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:10%
you have a very
diverse background,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.243 align:middle line:10%
because I did say chiropractic
is one of your areas,

00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:10%
but you have been a soldier.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:10%
You have been a teacher.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:10%
You have-- well, I
read one paragraph

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:10%
that went through
about 20 things

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:10%
that you have done
in your lifetime.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:10%
So you have been very active.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.993 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:10%
In the martial arts,
but a lot of things

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.702 align:middle line:10%
that actually were a part
of your spiritual path.

00:06:10.702 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:10%
You were on a teacher in the--

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Muktananda Sita yoga.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And that was an honor
early on that you got,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:10%
because you said
you were the only--

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well I was one of the
first five people to be with

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:10%
Muktanada.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
When he first came over, he
was brought by Werner Erhard,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and there were five people--

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Richard Alpert, Ram
Dass, Werner Erhard.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember the others.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of the
water boy then.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very exciting time.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And he had that gift of using
his voice and music to also get

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:90%
us out of our left brains.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.297 align:middle line:90%
It was very wonderful.

00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:10%
>> And sita yoga is
what that movement is?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:10%
>> But in Siddhis, Sita, that is
like some of the miracle kinds

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:10%
of things that happened?

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not related.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
A Sita in that
tradition is one whose--

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it means kua, a person
who's kind of gotten rid

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the ordinary things
of life-- the jealousies,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the tendency to judge,
and those sorts of things.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The Siddhis, it sounds
like a city like Minneapolis,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:10%
those are the powers that
some of the Swamis in India,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:10%
for example, are known for--
the healing powers or telepathic

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:10%
powers, those sorts of things.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, your journey took you
this-- in 1997 back to India.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:10%
And we just kind of
moved up to some of that

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:10%
why you had a background there.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:10%
You said you'd visited maybe
15 times from the '70s.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> So you were in a
tradition of having a guru,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:10%
and you must have
been then ready,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:10%
and telepathically
you were called.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:10%
I was ready.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> And your experience, then,
the story that you tell,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:10%
you mentioned the
petals from the lotus.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And tell me about that.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the
sections in your book.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, petals from the lotus
in the book at the initiation

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:90%
describes my--

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
what happened to me after I
had been initiated by Babaji

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:90%
into the monastic order.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was traveling
through India

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and had the privilege
of meeting a healing

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
rabbi by the name of Nathan.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:22.368 align:middle line:84%
And in India, there's a small
group of the Jewish community

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that Nathan was a part
of, and they've been there

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
for hundreds of years.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had that ability
of the laying on of hands.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was very
surprised, you know, by that.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I even would
ask him as a rabbi.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I was a new Swami, and
I said, well, you know,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
do they teach you
this in rabbi school?

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, not exactly.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was a gift
that had come to him,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.452 align:middle line:84%
and I felt very honored
to watch some of the--

00:08:50.452 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
firsthand some of the
miraculous healings

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.535 align:middle line:84%
that were possible
from that, you

00:08:53.535 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
know, power of
laying on of hands.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It was also a time for
me when I got to reconnect

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:84%
to my childhood teacher, and
let go of a lot of the world.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:10%
>> But you were able to actually
do healing work yourself,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:10%
and that's part of the result
of the initiation was that you

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:10%
have then come into what would
be your purpose on the planet,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:10%
why you're here, and what
you're supposed to be doing.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, thank you
for saying that.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The healing work
is a gift, I feel,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that I carry from
my teacher Babaji,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and I feel much like a
soldier showing up for duty.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've witnessed
firsthand many healings that

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:84%
have taken place from that
gift, and I feel very honored

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to be a resource for those that
need that kind of a healing.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:10%
>> And the reason that you
were chosen to do this work?

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably because
in Babaji's words,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:10%
he says you're a Balagundi.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I asked him, I said,
why me, Babaji?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're Balagundi.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, what's that?

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And inside I'm thinking, OK,
he means he's a vegetarian.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
He's been meditating
for, you know, 10 years.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't earned a lot of money.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
This is all good.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, he says,
it's, you're a crazy,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:90%
because bala means crazy.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.983 align:middle line:90%
And he said, gundi is a rebel.

00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, do I have to tell you
what the two words together

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:90%
mean?

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, the West
needs a crazy rebel,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
someone who is willing to
look at things differently

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to make change to
bring us to a higher level.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was my gift.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So your assignment,
then, is basically,

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:41.183 align:middle line:10%
because you are of the West but
you have studied the Eastern

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:10%
philosophies, and you
have done your homework,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:10%
and you have been good.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:10%
You are a crazy rebel,
or something like that.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:10%
And then, you're actually
supposed to then come back

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:10%
with a message that would make
a difference in people's lives

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.542 align:middle line:10%
and on their spiritual path.

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm working
on that message.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:90%
We call it Prema.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on it with my
wife, and we're developing

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual lifestyle.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
The Eastern masters
that I was with

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:84%
felt very much that we
need to get in shape again.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
America needs to get fit, and
that physical fitness, as well

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
as mental and spiritual fitness.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we are working
very much in Prema.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call it, a
lifestyle spirituality that's

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
uniquely designed for
Westerners, but it's not--

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:90%
that they can approach.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not to Eastern.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we're going to do
is, we will be taking a break.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.123 align:middle line:84%
But when we come
back, we have to talk

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:33.157 align:middle line:84%
about the actual initiation,
because it's fascinating

00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
what's happened, and
a little bit more

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
about these Siddhis, which
are like the miracles.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I think people find
this fascinating.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:10%
So if you will stay tuned,
we will be right back

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:10%
with more of "The Initiation."

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:90%
[UPLIFTING MUSIC]

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:10%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking with
Dr. Donald Schnell,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:10%
also Prema Baba Swamiji is the
other name that he was gifted,

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and he was gifted that
during "The Initiation,"

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:10%
and that is the name of the
book that he has written,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:10%
and that is what we will
be talking about today.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:10%
So "The Initiation,"
and I said, let's

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:10%
talk about the actual
ceremony, because there

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:10%
were some phenomenal things
that you experienced.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was--

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
it's so hard for me
to talk about it.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:10%
When I left India, I couldn't
talk about it, in fact,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.472 align:middle line:10%
for three or four months, and--

00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Was it just too
personal, or was it--?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, tears would come up and
I would just start, you know,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:10%
crying.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:10%
>> And did you-- was it so much
that you experienced that it

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.513 align:middle line:10%
was just emotional
in the impact of it?

00:12:39.513 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't just emotional.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:10%
It was certainly spiritual.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:90%
It was like a baptism.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very deep, and
there were many elements to it.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, of sitting around
the fire with the other monks,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and the horns and things.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:90%
It was a very picturesque.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
moments that was--

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
well, I'll always remember,
was when Babaji said to me

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:90%
to get a coal from the fire.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.482 align:middle line:84%
And I had had fire walking,
and I had, in fact,

00:13:10.482 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
had picked up coals
before, so I thought, well,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
he's just confirming for me that
I had mastered that ability.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.632 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached down,
and I used my left hand,

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want
to-- if I did get burned.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Didn't want right
one, your favorite hand.

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:27.885 align:middle line:84%
>> So I reached down and I
picked up a coal, and it stung,

00:13:27.885 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and it was hot.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And Babaji asked me what
my favorite god was.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was a little--

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
asking the right person, there's
a lot a lot of choices there.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, well,
Shiva, the first guru.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And he took his hand
and tapped my hand,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:90%
and he said, open your hand.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened it, there
was a beautiful, egg-shaped,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
crystal-like object
that was just glowing.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And I touched it with my thumb.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And he said, don't touch.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And where I touched
it, it had indented.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:10%
It was soft.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:10%
I have that crystal now.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:10%
I don't have it with me, but it
is the indent is still in it.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The imprint is-- the thumbprint
is on it, and it's very hard.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very beautiful.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
coal in my hand.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:10%
There was some black ash
where the coal had been.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
his little Siddhis.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what
happened then to you,

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:10%
the purpose of this initiation--
and you did go through this,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.560 align:middle line:10%
and you did meet with
Babaji, who again,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:10%
is thousands of years old
and still on the planet,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:10%
will appear occasionally
and so forth.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:10%
The purpose was for you to bring
this message back to the West.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, you and your lovely
wife, who we will mention,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:10%
it's Marilyn Diamond, who is
co-author of "Fit for Life"

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:10%
and your soulmate partner.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:10%
Very much.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:10%
>> And you together, now,
are supposed to do what?

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:10%
Do you think will
help people move

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:10%
on their spiritual path,
the result of your being

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:10%
ordained into this order?

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know that
people care about that one way

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:90%
or the other really so much.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, I think as
individuals we care about what

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:90%
can spirituality do for us.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
How can it help
me with my family?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.617 align:middle line:84%
How can it help
me with my career?

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:17.825 align:middle line:90%
How will help me lose weight?

00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And Babaji in that
sense is very practical.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
He's very old, but he's still
in a 24-year-old looking body.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
He's very fit looking,
and extremely,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
extremely, healthy,
very, very radiant.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And Marilyn brings
that technology,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and we've combined
it with what Babaji

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
has taught for immortality,
how to regenerate the body,

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
rejuvenate the body--
really Eastern secrets

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that are not readily available.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the work that
we're doing in Prema,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.532 align:middle line:84%
bringing that
technology to the West

00:15:53.532 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
so it'll help-- the
spirituality will help them

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:90%
in a very practical way.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a practical approach--
one of the things that you were

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
taught is called
inner breathing.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
now the inner breathing
will do what for us?

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And can you show us?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you teach that?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Can it be that simple
that you can show me now

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:90%
how I might inner breathe?

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we could.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The inner breathing, the concept
behind the inner breathing,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
is very much similar
to the understanding

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that acupuncturists have
about our physical body.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They believe in
China that there's

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:84%
some kind of energy
system inside of the body,

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.615 align:middle line:84%
like an energy nerve
pathway almost.

00:16:25.615 --> 00:16:26.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:26.415 --> 00:16:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether that's true
or not, we don't know.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that scientists have
measured at Yale University

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
a force field
around human beings

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that seems to expand
when we're healthy

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and shrink when we get cancer
or other kinds of illnesses.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Babaji's inner
breath is designed

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to move this energy
in a way that furthers

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual evolution.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
In the very simplest way
to share it with you,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:84%
he just says find a
comfortable place sitting down,

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
because if you stand up
you might faint if you're

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:90%
taking in too much air.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So just to kind of relax
and close your eyes,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.624 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do a
couple of breaths.

00:17:02.624 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:10%
He says, let your eyes
be closed and relaxed,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:10%
and then bring in an
inhalation through your mouth,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:10%
long, slow, and deep, way down
to the base of your spine,

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:10%
visualizing white
light coming in.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you exhale,
visualize a warm golden light

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
coming up your spine, and
let it flow out of your body.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.992 align:middle line:84%
And he says to repeat that
breath seven times a day.

00:17:40.992 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it just that simple?

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:10%
Seven times a day.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> But with a strong intent and
focus that you're taking that

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
time for your
spiritual development.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You're moving this divine
energy that we all have.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Intention in focus.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Because breath is--

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> We all breathe.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:10%
>> In every culture, we know
that it is very important.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We also are going to speak
just about Prana and Kundalini,

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
because Prana is also
affected by the breathing.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And how would you define
for us, spiritually, Prana

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.575 align:middle line:90%
and Kundalini?

00:18:09.575 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's-- the Prana in
the classical yogic definition

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:90%
is any energy.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Light is Prana.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Electricity is
Prana, or the food

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
we digest that energy-- that
chemical energy it makes

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
is Prana.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini energy is that
unique part of Prana

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that is our own individual,
spiritual core or essence.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in the yogic and
spiritual philosophies,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
they believe that if we
breathe in such a way,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
like we just did with
the inner breath,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
we're stimulating the
Prana, the Kundalini

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Prana, our spiritual energies,
to expand in our lives.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.272 align:middle line:84%
If we don't take the moment
to do that breathing,

00:18:47.272 --> 00:18:48.313 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:18:48.313 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like brushing our teeth.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.435 align:middle line:84%
If we brush our teeth,
our teeth get cleaned.

00:18:51.435 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
If we want to expand
our spiritual core,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
we take a moment and
breathe with intention,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and it'll expand.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:90%
It's common sense.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:90%
And so then, the Kundalini.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, we mentioned your wife,
and her spiritual name is Leela.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And Leela is an
important word to Babaji.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Babaji said to me, Prema Baba
Swamaji, you've got a laugh.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm too serious.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:90%
He knows that.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And Leela means play.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And very much in the
West, it's become--

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
this depression has become
a number one epidemic.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And Illness.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's amazing.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> With two parent families,
the working that we're doing,

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
we focus so much on
achievement and work--

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a carryover
from the '80s and the '90s--

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that we really have,
in a way, forgotten

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
how to play and to become
like little children again.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
That's not a new message, but
we've certainly forgotten that.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And Leela in our work in
Prema brings that message

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to help us recover our
natural youthfulness.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
That's where our regeneration
and rejuvenation lies.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in that inner child.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So that childlike part
of us just to play.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I like that.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Also, I wanted you to share
the power of chanting.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:10%
And you have your own
mantra that you have chosen,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.982 align:middle line:10%
and the mantra, and the purpose
of it, and the power of it.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:10%
Would you explain that?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's, Om-Prema-Om?

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Om-Prema-Om.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Om-Prema-Om is a simple
device that allows us to--

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
it's a phrase that allows
us to focus on love.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And Om simply means,
it means truth.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the Hebrew word,
amen, which also means truth.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's truth,
love, truth, love.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And love is truth.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And the way the monitor is used,
it's used in a meditative style

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
when you have 15, 20 minutes,
or even 5 minutes just

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and
inwardly, by repeating

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that sound, Om-Prema-Om,
what the Babaji says

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
is that those words are
blessed so that they

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:90%
spark our natural love inside.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The Babaji is teaching us that
the soul, sweetness itself,

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you say the word,
you bring up the image,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
just like when you say
cat and you think of cat.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Prema was uniquely designed to
bring up our own divine love.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when we repeat that
mantra, Om-Prema-Om a little

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
each day, it's like
digging in a well

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and bringing out some water.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We start to nourish
our flower within.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And that meditation on
a daily basis, you said,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
could be as little
as five minutes,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but you really recommend
about 20 minutes.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Of quiet time.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Babaji would love to see
us meditate for one minute,

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And our Western scientists
are telling us, look,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:90%
we're overstressed.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Do it for 20 as a minimum.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
reality is most people say,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
another burden to do?

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So Babaji is saying,
get your feet wet.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Try it for one minute.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Take a minute.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Go deep inside,
and do Om-Prema-Om.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we thank you.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
having me on your show.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It's been a privilege.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It has been a pleasure.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:10%
>> If you would like to be in
touch with Dr. Donald Schnell,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.947 align:middle line:10%
Prema Baba Swamaji, or us, we
always love to hear from you.

00:22:10.947 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:10%
And stay tuned, too.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.328 align:middle line:10%
We have some parting thoughts.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Ah, So.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:10%
Living in balance in
mind, body, spirit.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:10%
We can do that when
East meets West.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:10%
There are gifts from both.

May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
