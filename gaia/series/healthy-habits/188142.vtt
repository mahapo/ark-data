seven, our grand finale,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.670 align:middle line:84%
is all about nourishing
the cells of your body.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.700 align:middle line:84%
At Food Matters, we believe
that what you eat, you become,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.912 align:middle line:84%
and how you eat can impact
the quality of your cells

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and the quality of your life.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So in these recipes, we're
going to show you a green juice

recipe.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:84%
If you have a juicer and
a green smoothie recipe,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:90%
if you have a blender--

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is a great
way to introduce

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
liquid, plant-based
rich nutrition

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
into your diet each morning to
help set yourself up for a win.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.658 align:middle line:84%
Even if your diet slowly
tapers out throughout the day,

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
you started off well, and
it's going to help set you up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
for a great day.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy.

To make the super
detox green juice,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:10%
you'll need two to three
celery stalks leaves removed,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:10%
one small cucumber,
peeled, if not organic, two

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.822 align:middle line:10%
kale leaves, one small lemon
or lime, and one pear or apple.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
To get started, simply
turn on the juicer

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and start juicing away.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to put the celery in
first and save some for later,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
in case we need to push
some of that lemon through.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Celery is fantastic
for inflammation,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
for helping
inflammation of the gut.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It's also, according
to the Dr. [INAUDIBLE],,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
really powerful for healing
bones, because it actually

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
looks and acts a lot like a
bone, if you think about it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.013 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
broken bone or if you

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
have a weak or
brittle bones, make

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.638 align:middle line:90%
sure to juice lots of celery.

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:50.133 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.212 align:middle line:84%
That is the super
detox green juice.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
To make this super
healthy, delicious

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and filling green
smoothie, you will

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
need one banana, half an
avocado, a handful of spinach,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
one serve of protein
powder of choice, one date,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
pitted, 14 ounces of a
plant-based, unsweetened milk

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:90%
of choice.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That's about a cup and a half.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
No, it's about two cups.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can use coconut, hemp,
almond, cashew, rice, and half

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.805 align:middle line:90%
a teaspoon of cinnamon.

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So to make this smoothie,
we're going to blend everything

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:90%
together in our blender.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So going in would be banana,
grapefruit, potassium.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And with the
spinach, which is one

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
of the most alkalizing
greens on the planet,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in with our avocado,
amazingly healthy fats.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, protein powder,
it's really important

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you source
clean protein powders,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
if you have any sort of
animal source protein powders,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.543 align:middle line:90%
and make sure it's grass-fed.

00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
There are whey protein
powders out there

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
that do grass fed whey.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing vegetarian
or vegan sources,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.465 align:middle line:84%
make sure they're as
clean as possible.

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, check if they've
had any heavy media metal

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
analysis done on
it, because there's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rice
protein powders now

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:90%
that are high in heavy metals.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Not great.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we go in with our
date, awesome sweetener.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the cinnamon, which
helps to regulate blood sugar.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
That also adds a great
flavor to the smoothie,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and to the milk of choice.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
This could be a homemade
nut milk, if you want,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
or a homemade cashew milk,
coconut milk, hemp milk.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Or you could do store bought.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing a store
bought milk for this smoothie,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend unsweetened,
because we're adding

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.902 align:middle line:90%
banana and a date to this.

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're sweeteners
that we understand

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.985 align:middle line:84%
we know what the
ingredients are,

00:03:56.985 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
whereas the milk that
is sweetened these days,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
it's generally not
always that kosher.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.874 align:middle line:84%
So give it a good blend
up, and then we'll serve.

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:09.353 align:middle line:10%
[BLENDING]

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:13.592 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going
to serve it up.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.508 align:middle line:84%
I did want to say
as well that this

00:04:16.508 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
is one of our great
green smoothie recipes,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
but you are the alchemist
of your own kitchen.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you wanted to add
other things, such as more

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
green powder, or some
hemp seeds, or chia seeds,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
or market powder, or
some extra nut butter,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
or some milk a cow powder,
or some fresh mint,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.547 align:middle line:90%
it's your kitchen.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't control you.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop you.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:90%
