Which makes including the habit of hydration a no-brainer. \r\n\r\nDrinking enough fluids is crucial to staying healthy and maintaining the function of every system in your body, including your heart, brain, and muscles. With 55-75% of your body consisting of H2O it is imperative that we are adequately hydrated to support our body in its natural processes of flushing out bacteria, daily detoxification and cell and weight maintenance. \r\n\r\nHydration can come in many shapes and forms! Whether it is drinking 1-2L of water daily, munching on water-rich foods regularly, like cucumbers, tomatoes, apples or spinach or including the habit of lemon water first up in the morning into your daily routine. \r\n\r\nIn this video, James Colquhoun shares the recipe for his Lemon & Ginger Detox drink. Hydrating first up in the morning is a great way to ensure you’re meeting your daily hydration needs, the addition of lemon juice can help the body flush out toxins and aid digestion and the ginger helps to soothe the stomach, reduce inflammation and provides a gentle pick-me-up! \r\n\r\nIf you don’t have lemons on hand, a big glass of room temperature filtered water will suffice! The main takeaway from this habit, is encouraging a routine of hydrating first up in the morning - whatever that may look like for you. \r\n\r\nJames Colquhoun is a Wellness Pioneer, filmmaker of Food Matters and Hungry For Change and founder of FMTV.","teaser":"Water is the basis of all life and that includes your body!

This is what makes you feel happier, instantly! \r\n\r\nIn addition, moving your body can alleviate stress, nourish and oxygenate your cells and boost energy levels.
