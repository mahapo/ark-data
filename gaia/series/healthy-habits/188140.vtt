>> Healthy habit number five
is all about cold exposure.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The science is emerging and
proving and showing to us that

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:84%
by exposing our bodies to
a little bit of a challenge

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:84%
in the morning-- i.e., having
a warm shower and then exposing

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:90%
it to the cold just at the end--

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
can help to stimulate brown
fat adipose in the back,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:84%
can help to stimulate
the production of oxygen

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
in the cells, and help to
improve your immune function.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.731 align:middle line:84%
A cold shower a day keeps
the doctor away, they say.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoy it, and
I hope you try it out,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:84%
because once you do,
you'll never go back.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.648 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:43.424 align:middle line:90%
the

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In the morning,
you're still in bed,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:90%
so you're very tranquil.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Your body is detensed
and up till the tissue.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Then, you're without
food in the body,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
so the body's chemistry
is not into working.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not digesting the energy.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not concentrated
over there.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:90%
It's able to flow throughout.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you do your
breathing exercise

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and you can show it to
yourself from being acidic,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
because the night goes on,
all kinds of acidic elements

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
come out of your body,
they get into your system.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself being
acidic when you rise.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Within 20 minutes
of this breathing,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
you will be able to become
completely alkaline.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And that makes you very
much better performing

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Very much more in control at
will of your mood and energy.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:10%
We only need to do
this breathing, just

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
deeper breathing.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, a cold
shower is stimulating

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
the vascular system, which
is the transportation system.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And it brings about
energizing elements

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
inside the body called
oxygen. And it brings it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:90%
to the immune cells.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the immune
cells are awake.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
When you have these temperature
differences, people get a cold.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's only because you
are not adapting directly

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
to work that change, because
your immune cells are not

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:90%
really active.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They are a little bit,
because of the comfort,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and like a muscle non-trained.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
how to handle it.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we do with
the cold shower

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
is alerting the immune cells by
alerting the vascular system.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It's 75,000 miles, 1,000
miles, inside of each of us,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
full of reflexes and
primitive muscles.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
They are being exercised
by the cold shower.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart rate goes
down, but because it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to compensate the
loss of the vascular system

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
to transport oxygen and
right nutrients in the body,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:90%
so stress hormone is less.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart rate goes
down to its natural status.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It's far too high, and
creating stress in the body.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's alarming for
a heart, which go,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to compensate, to get the
blood flow through because all

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
these little muscles and the
reflexes of the 75,000 miles

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:84%
are not working together
with the heart, lazybones.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart
trying to compensate.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It creates a signal to the
brain stem, the primitive brain,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian brain,
hey, there is danger.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Stress hormone.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And that stress
hormone is constantly,

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in the modern man, woman,
human in society, present.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:90%
the action going.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Thus, on the cell level,
there is no peace.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
There is no rest, which it needs
to rehabilitate for its energy,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to store up energy.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we get defense
systems of ours,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
they become lower, because
they have no energy.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And we are working ourselves
even to burnout and fatigue.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Very important that the defense
system, it needs energy.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the
systems to do that,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
but we do not
breathe well enough.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
doesn't get the oxygen.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And then all these processes,
like aerobic dissimulation,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%
they don't happen.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the defense
systems, of course,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
are not accurate to work its
ability to fend off disease,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to any danger, not only
the cold, but also to virus.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We got all these.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
We are exposed all the
time to bacteria, viruses,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:90%
and bacteria.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
But if the defense
system is right,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
then there is no
danger whatsoever.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And we got it all in our heads.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And we can feel when
we become a little bit

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
awkward, like getting
to sickness, or flu,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.255 align:middle line:84%
or a fever, or any other
disease, like autoimmune,

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:27.055 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
We can feel it, but we lost
this contact within to deal

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
with that at that moment.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:90%
We take it for granted.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And we keep on in our rat race.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And we do not know how
to stand still and become

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
aware of our physiology
at that moment,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to maintain happy,
strong, and healthy.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:90%
We just know it.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:90%
But now we got it.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So comfort, real comfort, is
the confidence and the strength

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and the happiness within, and
maintaining it at any time.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Be the master of yourself,
and that feels good.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:90%
