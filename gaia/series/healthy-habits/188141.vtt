[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Healthy habit number six is
all about body love exercises.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.310 align:middle line:10%
This is about that
moment that you

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.010 align:middle line:10%
have with yourself as you step
out of your morning shower

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:10%
or bathing ritual, and
that you have a moment

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:10%
to reflect with
your body, to just

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.790 align:middle line:10%
give your body a nice message
of love and reassurance,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:10%
and to help train
that in a dialogue

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.155 align:middle line:10%
to be more positive and
less self-destructive.

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoy learning
about this process.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it comes
back to self-love.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:10%
You will not look at
someone else's perfect life

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:10%
with disdain, or anger, or
jealousy when you feel great

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:10%
about yourself.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're in
the depths of despair,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to pick yourself up.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But in all reality, to get
on and through with life,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
you got to do
something, which is

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
why I found Essential
Oils so helpful,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're like
my little buddy.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They're like my little tool, my
little tip, my little strategy

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:90%
that makes me do something.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So putting a diffuser on,
or lighting a vaporizer

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and putting your few
drops of essential oil

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
into the top of it, and allowing
the first few breaths for you

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to take a moment to
acknowledge that,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
is an act of self-care, a
gift to self-care to yourself.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.167 align:middle line:90%
It could be in the body.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a shower
whether I'm down in the dumps

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
At some point, I'm
going to take a shower.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I start putting two drops of,
say, lavender on my flannel

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in the shower, and body
boosting my whole body with it.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a little thing.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It's still having
a shower, but I'm

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
doing something, a
little treat to myself.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I do a ritual that I've
done every single day

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
since I was 9, 10.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:84%
After my shower, I take
a teaspoon of carrier oil

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and three drops of my
chosen Essential Oils.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
A few sprays of magnesium.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I mix it together
in a little bowl.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And from toe to head,
I massage myself

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and give thanks to
every part of my body.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And usually at the end of
that, I will say something

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
like, today is going to be a
great day, or I'm a good mom,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
or I'm an amazing
businesswoman, or I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
can write this article today.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's great
on the good days.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe in being
authentic and integral

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.352 align:middle line:90%
on the days that aren't so good.

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that
ritual on a day

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
when you're not
feeling so great,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
then when you get
to the part where

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.715 align:middle line:84%
you take three deep breaths
and say something nice,

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
then that is the
day I'll say, I'm

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:90%
just grateful I'm breathing.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be asking
God, source, universe,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
give me the courage,
grace, strength, dignity,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.638 align:middle line:84%
and amazing ability
to get through this.

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's about
being authentic when you're

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
going through tough times.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Putting a half a
lemon into your water

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
may seem like such
a simple ritual,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but it is such a
cleansing thing to do.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor of taking
water to cleanse,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and lemon to help cleanse
your digestive system, also

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
helps cleanse negative
thoughts and thinking.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Walking outside with a drop
of frankincense on a tissue

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and taking three deep breaths in
bare feet, touching the earth,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to
connect us to source,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:84%
or at least reach out and ask
for some guidance and support.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe in taking, going
out walking in nature,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:90%
even if it's a walk on concrete.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes for me, when
I go out running or jogging,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it hurts.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And instead of giving
up, God, I can't do this,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I've got a mantra that I say
every time any part of me

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
hurts, my heart included,
when I'm out walking in nature

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
or running in
nature, and that is,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
every step I take I'm
connected to you, Mother Earth.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Every breath I take, I'm aware
of my thoughts, feelings,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I am proud, privileged,
and honored to be out here

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.257 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of all
of those who can't.

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me that there's
people that would give anything

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to be out here
walking in nature,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
or there's people out there
that would love two healthy legs

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to walk, or there's people
who are so broken hearted,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
they can't even
breathe right now.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So part of I giving
back to humanity

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
is honoring all
those people in pain

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
through my own daily
self-care rituals.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.557 align:middle line:84%
Can be something as
simple as a spritzer.

00:03:56.557 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, filling a
little bottle with water

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and adding six drops of
essential oil to them.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:90%
I have them in the car.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I have them my handbag.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.005 align:middle line:84%
I have them in the fridge
on hot, sunny days.

00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.005 align:middle line:84%
I have them beside the
bed when I say good night

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.365 align:middle line:90%
to my children, who are still--

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:90%
they're now adult children.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I still automatically
spritz and kiss them

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:90%
goodnight every night.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
They'll get a little spritz
with some calming oils.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I call them
aromatic anchors, ways in which

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to anchor yourself to
the truth, to the core,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to the rawness of
where I'm at right now,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
but giving me something to do,
so that I can get through it.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I think all of these
little rituals and anything

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
to do with nature, food,
breath, meditation--

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:90%
oh, my gosh.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
You see when you're
feeling down and out,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
sometimes sitting
there meditating

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is the last thing you've
got the courage to do,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.627 align:middle line:84%
because the monkey
brain kicks in,

00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
or we don't feel good
about it, or whatever.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Well after reading Thich
Nhat Hanh's book, the Tibetan

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist monk, he talks
about being mindful.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So even as you're
cutting a tomato

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to put on your paleo bread for
lunch, as you're cutting it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the tomato and
think about the farmer that

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
grew it that you bought
from your farmers' markets

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that morning, looking at the
four chambers of that tomato

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:84%
as you're cutting
it and realizing

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that the nutrients
in that tomato

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
are talking to you in
the shape, that tomatoes

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.585 align:middle line:84%
are wonderful for the
heart, we call that

00:05:13.585 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:90%
the Doctrine of Signatures.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Plants and foods are
constantly talking to us,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
just even saying
that, or being mindful

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of how a walnut
looks like the brain,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
is mindfulness,
which is meditation.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to sit
there for an hour saying ohm.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It could just taking a deep
breath and saying, I am love.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:90%
That is meditation.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think as a busy
woman, a mom, and anyone

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
out there who is
frantic in life,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.155 align:middle line:84%
or feeling like life
is frantic to them,

00:05:40.155 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:84%
then it's those
small what I call

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
micromoments of mindfulness
that is an act of self-care.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It's about space, silence.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about giving yourself that
solitude, those moments, that

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
will help refill your
cup, so that you can

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%
get through the next breath.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I always say, moment by moment,
breath by breath, day by day,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.113 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:06:02.113 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And even in the moments
I haven't, I will then

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.947 align:middle line:84%
remind myself, I just
got through that moment.

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:90%
So, in fact, I have.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:90%
You are still here.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
You have got through the
worst moments in your life.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in hindsight,
when we look back

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
at those times that have been
really challenging, I would

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
almost suggest that anything
that's been challenging

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.453 align:middle line:84%
to you in your life,
that you look back on,

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
when you look back
on it with hindsight,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
you could almost say,
yes, it was a gift,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
or it is because of
that, I have actually

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
created this in my life,
or I've become that,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:84%
or I have met this person,
or I have studied that.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.557 align:middle line:84%
There is a gift in
every challenge.

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just whether or
not we're willing to be

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
open to having the perception
that we deserve the truth,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and the pathway to finding
that new way of being.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, it is
through the powerful mastery

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual leaders
that they will also

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
say that that is
part of the pathway.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Struggle is the pathway to self,
to God, to universe, to source.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
