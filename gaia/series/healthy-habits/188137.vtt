which is all about hydration.

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:10.850 align:middle line:10%
And in this recipe
video, I'm going

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.890 align:middle line:10%
to be showing you how to
introduce lemon juice to water.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It sounds simple, but
there's so many variations.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.142 align:middle line:84%
You can add cayenne, you can add
turmeric, you can add ginger.

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:90%
You can add salt, even.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:90%
You can add apple cider vinegar.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:84%
All ways to help
stimulate the liver

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to help facilitate
detoxification processes

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:84%
within the body, and to
help hydrate yourselves.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%

>> To make the ginger
lemon detox drink,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:10%
you will need 10 ounces of
spring or filtered water,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:10%
half an inch nub ginger
root, diced finely,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:10%
the juice of half a
lemon and, optionally,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:10%
a tablespoon of raw honey.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.553 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
take the fresh ginger

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and put it in your
hand like this.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
We use a rasper to
get it this fine,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
or you can chop it really fine.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.092 align:middle line:84%
Just squeeze it
through your fingers.

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Let the ginger juice
drain into the water.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Then add the juice of
half a lemon straight in.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I'd only have it like that.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Or you can add the
optional honey,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
if you like it a
little bit sweeter.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Stir it all together.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
