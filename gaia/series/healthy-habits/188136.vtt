and your immune system and help

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and effectively, then healthy
habits and morning rituals,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:84%
although simple, can have a
profound and lasting impact

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.305 align:middle line:90%
on your health and well-being.

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
In this program, we're
going to cover and guide you

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
through seven healthy habits
that are scientifically

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
proven to help in all
these areas of your life.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Number one is hydration
through lemon water.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
This helps to hydrate your
body, to stimulate the liver,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
to flush out unwanted toxins,
and support natural weight

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:90%
loss.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.453 align:middle line:90%
Number two is to move your body.

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
This helps to boost the
production of happy hormones

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
with dopamine and
serotonin, and also

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:90%
increase blood circulation.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Number three is breath work.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
So simple, yet so profound.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
This increases
oxygenation in the body

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and also helps to improve energy
and boost your immune system.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Thereafter, number
four, meditation.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And this helps to reduce
stress hormones, which

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is so important in this modern
age of overwhelm and stress

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and burnout.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Also helps to lower blood
pressure and reduce anxiety.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Number five-- cold exposure.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you can
do by turning on the cold water

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:84%
after you've had a hot shower or
jumping in a pool or the ocean.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And this can help to
stimulate blood circulation

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in the body for increased
energy and immune cell

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
response for fighting disease.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Next, number six, is
body love exercises.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And by giving yourself a
quick massage or a dry skin

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
brush with positive
affirmations,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
you can help to develop a
more positive relationship

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
with your body and
quiet down and dampen

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that inner self-critic.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And number seven is
to nourish your body

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.203 align:middle line:84%
with a green juice
or a smoothie, which

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is about flooding your body
with nutrients in the morning,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
helping support your
body's detoxification

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
processes in that
critical part of the day,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and to strengthen your immune
system and support weight loss.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
These seven healthy
habits have been

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
designed and
scientifically proven

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
