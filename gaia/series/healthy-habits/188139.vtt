00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to healthy
habit number 3,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.020 align:middle line:90%
which is all about breath work.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.780 align:middle line:10%
This is such a simple
and ancient technique

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:10%
to help oxygenate yourselves,
to help bring peace and calm

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:10%
to your body, and to help
support your immune system.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I really hope you enjoy
this breath work class

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.710 align:middle line:90%
that we have chosen for you.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's James here.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.205 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this
short breath work class.

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going
to be guiding you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
through a 4-4-8 process,
where we breathe in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
for 4, short pause,
hold for 4, short pause,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
exhale for 8, short pause,
and then start again.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
By extending the
exhalation of the breath,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
we send a signal to our body
and to our mind to calm down.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And that overriding signal
helps to bring more peace

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:90%
to our lives.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
To start, make sure we're in
a seated and upright position

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:90%
or laying down on the ground.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You can close your eyes to
bring your attention fully

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:90%
to the breath.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you
through explaining one round,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll start together.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%
So we go in 2, 3, 4.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.967 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes, up straight.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing
through your nose,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
you can rest your tongue
on the top of your mouth.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're breathing
through your mouth,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
as you can do it whatever way
feels most comfortable to you.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
And in 2, 3, 4.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
In, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.686 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:90%
And in 2, 3, 4.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:90%
In 2, 3, 4.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And in 2, 3, 4.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:90%
In 2, 3, 4.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:90%
In 2, 3, 4.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Hold 2, 3, 4.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you're finished,
just return the breath

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.795 align:middle line:90%
to its normal cadence.

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Or you can continue straight
into your meditation.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:90%
