00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to Healthy Habit
number 4, which is meditation.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.110 align:middle line:10%
I love doing meditation
after breath work, which

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.230 align:middle line:10%
is why we put it in spot four
because the breathing helps

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:10%
to calm your body and to
prepare a place of stillness.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And this class has been
handpicked for you.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.350 align:middle line:90%
It is a class with Laurentine.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I really hope that
you enjoy it and it helps

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to bring more peace,
happiness, and reduced anxiety

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and stress in to your morning.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Laurentine.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'd like to guide
you through this beautiful

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Gratitude Meditation.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:10%
This practice is
designed to help

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:10%
you relax, destress, and
find peace in your life,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:10%
which in turn helps to heal
your body, clear your mind,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:10%
and for you to engage
more positively

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:10%
with the world around you.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.748 align:middle line:10%
This Gratitude
Meditation is a process

00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:10%
which will guide you
through finding those things

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:10%
in your life that you
can be grateful for,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:10%
like your family, your friends,
a warm fire, a great book,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:10%
your beautiful body, a
body that heals itself,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:10%
an ability to serve, an ability
to help others to experience

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:10%
joy, to see a sunset, to
put your feet on the ground,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:10%
or to be alive just another day.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:10%
The more we can
invite gratefulness

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:10%
into our life as a daily
ritual, the more things

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:10%
will show up in our
life to be grateful for.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, the best place
to do this meditation

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:10%
is either sitting up
straight, lying in Shavasana,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:10%
or lying in bed either before
you fall asleep or first thing

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:10%
in the morning before you open
your eyes when your mind is

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.955 align:middle line:10%
still somewhat half asleep.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're using
a gratitude bracelet,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
you can count along
with the mala beads

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
tassel and working

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
your way around the bracelet
until you hit the tassel again.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have one,
that's perfectly fine.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't need one specifically
to do this practice.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoy
this meditation,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
so please let's begin.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Closing our eyes, we're
going to start with three

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.424 align:middle line:90%
deep, long, slow breaths.

00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's breathe in
together and out.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.655 align:middle line:90%
And in and out.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And in and out.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Releasing and letting go of
any unwanted tension, anything

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
that may be coming
up for you right now,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
anything that's no
longer serving you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
from the day, any
guilt, fear, or shame.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Just letting go of
everything right now.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.706 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.706 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And now let's think about the
things that we're grateful for.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.055 align:middle line:84%
And what is the first thing
that pops up into your mind?

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that you're
grateful for right now.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.274 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.274 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And say it in your mind's eye.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:35.365 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for-- and really
think about it and feel it.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine it
in your mind's eye.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.356 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And now what's the next thing
that you're grateful for?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.733 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And concentrating on the
feeling, the emotion of it.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's the next thing
that you're grateful for?

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine that particular
thing that you're grateful for,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that person, that
experience, that opportunity.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:24.602 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then what's another
thing that you're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
grateful for right now?

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.796 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And let it flow through you--

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
the things that
you're grateful for,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.165 align:middle line:90%
and the feelings, the thoughts.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.691 align:middle line:84%
And if something comes
up that makes you smile,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
just go deeper
into that thought.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Really experience and
feel into that thought.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And now let's be
grateful for our body.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Think about how great
our body has been for us.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we're experiencing any
pain or any system issues,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
let's be grateful for them
too, because they give us

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to heal,
and give us the opportunity

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to slow down, and give
us the opportunity

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
to focus on that
area of our body

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.025 align:middle line:90%
which needs love and kindness.

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful for our
mind, our intelligence.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.691 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful for our
neck and our shoulders that

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
help to carry our head high
as we move through life.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful for
our arms, for our ability

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to use them to
create, prepare food,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:32.115 align:middle line:84%
to write, to read,
and to embrace.

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful
now for our heart

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that beats without
us even having

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to think about it
thousands of times a day,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
serving our body with
oxygen-rich blood,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we may be
strong and healthy

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and continue to live
this human experience.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful now for
our stomach and our gut,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to digest
the food that we eat and just

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
know that it's there
for us to be nourished.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's be grateful
for our legs that

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
carry us in this earth--
our feet, our toes.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Just think about anything
else in your body

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're grateful
for right now.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the last part of
this Gratitude Meditation,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
let us be grateful for
things in the future

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.045 align:middle line:90%
that we wish to happen.

00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Let us be grateful for them
now rather than pray for them

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's be grateful for
them in the present

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they
already happened.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.588 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.588 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful now that
I've secured my dream job,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
or found the love of my life,
or you fill in the blank.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.255 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel when
you achieve this big goal

00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
that you're thinking
about right now?

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%
How good would it feel?

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that feeling right now.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.179 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's think about that
health goal that you have.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you want
to achieve with your health

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and imagine being grateful
for that right now.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like to
be that healthy right now?

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And what would you do with
that new-found health?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And let's think
about the experience

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that you wish to
experience and that you

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:90%
wish to have in your life.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And imagine just one
particular experience

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:90%
you've been dreaming of.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.339 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine how
grateful that you'd

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
be for this experience
and bring that gratitude

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:90%
into the present moment.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.626 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And now think about the
lineage of your family.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.695 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about seeing
that evolve into the future.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
What that would be
like, and look like,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and how beautiful
seeing your children

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
grow older and your
grandchildren grow older?

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
any children, just

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
see yourself becoming
a beautiful old member

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of the community that's
respected and loved with lots

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:90%
friends and family around you.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine how grateful
you feel for that experience.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And now as we come towards the
end of this meditation, let's

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
be grateful for the things
that are going to happen today.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've got an
exciting meeting at work

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:90%
or catching up with a friend.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the great things that
are going to come out of today

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and be grateful
for that right now.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're seeing a
family member today.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.762 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.762 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going
to think how grateful

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that we are to be able
to experience that.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have some other
things planned for your day.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And just imagining them
going well, and being

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:84%
here in the evening
or in the next day

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and being grateful
for that experience

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
that you've just had.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And now to finish
this meditation,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:09.660 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take
three, deep, long breaths.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And breathing in and out.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.115 align:middle line:90%
And in and out.

00:12:27.115 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:90%
And in and releasing.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
