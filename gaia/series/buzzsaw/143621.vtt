[THEME MUSIC] >>
SEAN STONE: Welcome

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.736 align:middle line:84%
to "Buzzsaw," where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.729 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.482 align:middle line:84%
is Jason Quitt who is a graduate
of the Institute of Energy

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:26.318 align:middle line:84%
Wellness, and a student
of Algonquin shamanism.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.778 align:middle line:84%
Jason has been
training and working

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.322 align:middle line:84%
with many teachers, shamans,
and traditional healers

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:31.406 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.659 align:middle line:84%
He's also the author of
"Forbidden Knowledge,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.973 align:middle line:84%
Revelations of a Multi
Dimensional Time Traveler,"

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:39.623 align:middle line:84%
"Egyptian Postures of Power,
Ancient Qigong System,"

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:43.543 align:middle line:84%
and "The Yosef Codes,
Sacred Geometry Mandalas."

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.587 align:middle line:84%
Today, he joins me
in this dimension

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.423 align:middle line:84%
to enlighten us
on this research.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.311 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by
asking, because your book

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.096 align:middle line:84%
says you're revelations of
a multi dimensional time

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:57.439 align:middle line:84%
traveler, so if you are multi
dimensional time traveler,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.559 align:middle line:90%
what does that actually mean?

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.355 align:middle line:84%
>> JASON QUITT: Well, it
means that I leave my body.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:04.855 align:middle line:84%
And once I'm out
of my body, there's

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:06.733 align:middle line:90%
no such thing as time or space.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.236 align:middle line:84%
So we can jump
through timelines.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.154 align:middle line:90%
We can jump through dimensions.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.198 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different levels

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.368 align:middle line:90%
of experience in those realms.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:19.371 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So was this
something that began since

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:20.372 align:middle line:90%
your childhood?

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.791 align:middle line:84%
Is it something even before
you were born that you recall?

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where-- yeah, where
does your journey begin?

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.256 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, I actually
remember coming to Earth,

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.216 align:middle line:90%
which is a very strange memory.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.551 align:middle line:84%
And I thought everybody
had that memory.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.888 align:middle line:84%
So I remember coming to
Earth, going through portals,

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:40.267 align:middle line:84%
getting to view my
parents before I was born,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:90%
and then, suddenly, I'm here.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.564 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
first started to talk,

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.608 align:middle line:84%
I would even tell my parents,
aren't you happy I chose you?

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.652 align:middle line:84%
Because I had this very
strong memory growing up that

00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:53.864 align:middle line:90%
I came to Earth.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:57.533 align:middle line:90%
And as a child, I was very--

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.412 align:middle line:84%
I would say opened
or psychic or gifted.

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:05.375 align:middle line:84%
And I would often have
a visitor in my room,

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.044 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of
children talk about,

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:11.214 align:middle line:84%
which is something
in their closet.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would go to
sleep at night,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.677 align:middle line:84%
and I would push the
door of my closet closed,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.971 align:middle line:84%
because I was very scared
of what was in there.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.391 align:middle line:84%
And at night, this closet door
would just open by itself,

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.311 align:middle line:84%
and there would be a shadow
standing in that closet.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.938 align:middle line:84%
And this shadow would
not only scare me,

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.775 align:middle line:84%
but it would take me
on journeys that night.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would be taken
back into time.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.573 align:middle line:84%
I would see past
lives, and sometimes I

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.158 align:middle line:84%
would just leave
my body by myself

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:42.079 align:middle line:84%
and just go to the local park
and play, or sit and watch

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.247 align:middle line:90%
people play baseball at night.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:47.084 align:middle line:84%
So I had these
abilities growing up.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.586 align:middle line:84%
But when I would
speak to my parents

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.381 align:middle line:84%
and tell them what
was happening to me,

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
they would just tell me that
this is completely normal,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.427 align:middle line:90%
and it's just called nightmares.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So I just believed
what I was experiencing

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.058 align:middle line:84%
was just nightmares,
and everybody had them.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.519 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what did you
learn about this shadow?

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because many people
have experienced

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.439 align:middle line:84%
this shadow man
standing in the room.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.984 align:middle line:84%
They've experienced shadow
attacks and feeling drained.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.903 align:middle line:90%
Psychic vampirism, for example.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:18.615 align:middle line:84%
But what do you understand
about the nature of this shadow?

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.784 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: From my
personal experience,

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:24.829 align:middle line:84%
and this has taken me a very
long time to figure out,

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.958 align:middle line:84%
because when it first started
to happen, you think, OK,

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:32.629 align:middle line:84%
this is like a ghost, or
an entity, or a demon,

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.713 align:middle line:90%
or an alien.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.258 align:middle line:84%
You really go to the
worst things first.

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:39.136 align:middle line:84%
And I believed that for
a very, very long time.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:43.557 align:middle line:84%
But now, I look at this shadow
as an initiator, something

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:50.772 align:middle line:84%
there to push us a little to
make us see another reality.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
they're testing us.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.779 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to wake
this guy up at night.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.489 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shake
him up a little,

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.782 align:middle line:90%
and let's see how he reacts.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.451 align:middle line:84%
Is he going to
react out of fear?

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:03.827 align:middle line:84%
Is he going to
react out of love?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:07.247 align:middle line:84%
Well, how is he going to
react to this situation?

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:12.586 align:middle line:84%
And over-- I'll say it was
scary the first 500 times.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.046 align:middle line:84%
First 500 times, I'm
fighting back, obviously.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this feeling.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.886 align:middle line:84%
But after about 500 times
of this happening to me,

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.596 align:middle line:90%
you get annoyed.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.055 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
getting annoyed,

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.932 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have
that impact anymore.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.601 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
come to visit you,

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.145 align:middle line:90%
and you say, oh, it's you again.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.813 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:38.069 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize that it's
your fear that you're feeling.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.571 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that's inside of you.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.239 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
rid of that fear,

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.909 align:middle line:84%
suddenly this whole other
world opens up to you.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.869 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: In terms
of your journeys,

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:49.539 align:middle line:84%
what types of other dimensions
have you seen, and off world?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.876 align:middle line:84%
Is it like, how you say,
in terms of other planets

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.086 align:middle line:84%
or other parts of
the universe, you

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.255 align:middle line:84%
would say this is multi
dimensional travel.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.467 align:middle line:84%
But do you believe that you have
actually been to other planets?

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.386 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I have been to other
planets, other dimensions,

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.798 align:middle line:84%
other timelines,
and parallel Earths.

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:06.598 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.809 align:middle line:84%
Those are all part of
my experience range.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.397 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it started to
happen to me quite drastically

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.317 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my early 20s.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.154 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen was, is
I would be sleeping at night,

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.114 align:middle line:84%
and I would actually be
forcefully pulled out

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.407 align:middle line:90%
of my body.

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:29.246 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine you're laying
in bed having a normal dream,

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:30.747 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
you feel something

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
reach inside your body and
yank you out of that dream.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And now you're floating
above yourself in your bed.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.758 align:middle line:84%
And so those
original experiences,

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.593 align:middle line:84%
I never asked for,
I never prayed,

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.763 align:middle line:84%
I never meditated for, they
just started happening.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So once I got yanked
out of my body--

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.813 align:middle line:84%
And this being, it looked like a
humanoid, but it was invisible.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.439 align:middle line:84%
You know that effect
from "Predator,"

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.984 align:middle line:84%
where it's like you could
make out their form,

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.068 align:middle line:90%
but you can't see them.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.778 align:middle line:90%
They almost look invisible.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
beings looked like.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.159 align:middle line:84%
And they would just rip me out
of my body, quite violently.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd be shot
up into outer space.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.957 align:middle line:84%
So I'd experience that, kind of
like the Google Earth effect,

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.835 align:middle line:84%
where you go right
out into outer space,

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.837 align:middle line:90%
and I can view the planets.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.755 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
they would direct me

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.133 align:middle line:90%
to another point on the planet.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.427 align:middle line:84%
And they'd shoot me
right back to that point.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:29.389 align:middle line:84%
And they would drop me off
in this new environment.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.976 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just kind of standing
in this new environment,

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:36.521 align:middle line:84%
and I realize it's not
a place I recognize.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
realized that, OK, this

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:43.403 align:middle line:84%
is not only astral travel, but
this is astral time travel.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.948 align:middle line:84%
I'm being placed in a
different timeline of Earth.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.993 align:middle line:84%
And the original things
that they would show me

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.955 align:middle line:84%
was very traumatic,
very horrific,

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:57.792 align:middle line:84%
almost like end of the
world type scenarios.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.794 align:middle line:84%
And they would drop
me there to witness

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.838 align:middle line:90%
whatever I was witnessing.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.299 align:middle line:84%
And once I got the feel
of it and the experience,

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle line:90%
they would come pick me back up.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.219 align:middle line:84%
I get shot back
into outer space,

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:09.929 align:middle line:84%
and then shot back
down into my body.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:12.557 align:middle line:84%
And I'd wake up,
white as a ghost,

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:16.853 align:middle line:84%
basically, because they were
quite traumatic events for me.

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But do you have an
understanding of why, why you,

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.692 align:middle line:84%
why you were chosen for this,
and these visions and messages?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.486 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I think
there's a couple reasons.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:28.531 align:middle line:84%
One, I think I've done
this in many past lives.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.116 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
I'm used to doing.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.161 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I'm
used to the feel of.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.829 align:middle line:84%
Also, I think it's
because I passed

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.832 align:middle line:90%
those tests with those shadows.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.669 align:middle line:84%
Seeing how I would react
to all these situations

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.255 align:middle line:84%
was actually leading up to
this really traumatic thing.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:47.926 align:middle line:84%
Because if I didn't
have that lead up,

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.969 align:middle line:84%
I would probably go
into a mental asylum

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.472 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, because
the things I saw,

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:56.017 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like a soldier
going into a battle.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.062 align:middle line:84%
You see things that
no one should see.

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:00.313 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: But for what purpose?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
show you the future

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.192 align:middle line:84%
or trying to show you part
of man's kind destiny?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the purpose of all this?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.737 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I think
it's a warning.

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:12.367 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- I don't believe
that that's our actual future.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.911 align:middle line:84%
What I really do
believe is that that

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.373 align:middle line:90%
is a path that we could walk.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:19.957 align:middle line:90%
It's a very likely timeline.

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:23.461 align:middle line:84%
And I got the sense
that in a parallel Earth

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.255 align:middle line:90%
that has already happened.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.174 align:middle line:84%
It has already occurred,
and we are actually

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
on a different timeline
that avoided those wars.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.597 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
being shown things that

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.474 align:middle line:90%
have actually occurred already.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Do you have a certain
sense of the intervention

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:84%
of these various beings, these
various aliens in terms of how

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:45.734 align:middle line:84%
much they are intervening in
human affairs and basically

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.069 align:middle line:84%
influencing our lives, even
if we don't realize it?

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.447 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They're
absolutely intervening,

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.574 align:middle line:90%
and in a positive way.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:58.288 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like we have to
take responsibility with them.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.166 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like they
can show someone like myself

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.792 align:middle line:90%
or awaken someone like myself.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle line:84%
They can show us other
worlds, other dimensions,

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle line:84%
spiritual knowledge,
and techniques.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.925 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take
that responsibility

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.886 align:middle line:90%
and then use it ourselves.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So when they would guide me
and teach me, I listened 100%.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.142 align:middle line:84%
And I use whatever
they taught me.

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's bettered my life.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.938 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken publicly
about the information that

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
was given to me, and
that's helped other people.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.904 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like they're
giving a carrot to some people

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:33.031 align:middle line:90%
and seeing if they take a bite.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, then you
get this great knowledge

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.368 align:middle line:90%
that comes into the world.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:40.079 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they choose
specific people to do this,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
because they know that their
life path or the people

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.877 align:middle line:84%
that they're connected
to, that message

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:48.046 align:middle line:84%
could reach a very
large amount of people

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.714 align:middle line:90%
and help a lot of people.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But you talk about
being taken out of your body

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.671 align:middle line:84%
and the use of portals, this
is almost more in the magical

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:56.471 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:59.974 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have a lot of
sightings of UFO craft,

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.227 align:middle line:90%
physical craft, technology.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:06.314 align:middle line:84%
Why do certain aliens need
physical manifestation craft,

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:10.151 align:middle line:84%
and others seem to use more
natural magic, portals,

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:11.194 align:middle line:90%
things like this?

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:15.865 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, I'll tell you
that I have never physically

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.867 align:middle line:90%
seen an alien, ever.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.577 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened to me.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:22.664 align:middle line:90%
But I've seen physical craft.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.625 align:middle line:84%
I've seen craft that I
would consider living,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.877 align:middle line:84%
alive, or dimensional,
because I've seen them

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.922 align:middle line:90%
pop in and out of existence.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:35.009 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing thing that
I find about my experiences

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.137 align:middle line:84%
is that I can sense
and feel that something

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.472 align:middle line:90%
is in the room with me.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.308 align:middle line:84%
But I can't see them
with my physical eyes.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.811 align:middle line:84%
But I have the ability
to leave my body,

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
so once I look out of my
body, suddenly those beings

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
are standing in this room, and
I can see them clear as day.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.362 align:middle line:84%
So from my understanding,
those beings,

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:57.866 align:middle line:84%
like I've seen what
people refer to as

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.326 align:middle line:84%
the Greys, or the
reptilians, or insectoids,

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.955 align:middle line:84%
or a whole list of
characters, I only

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:06.499 align:middle line:90%
saw them once I left my body.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:84%
So for me, they were
never a physical being.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.212 align:middle line:84%
For me, they were a
dimensional being.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.464 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And of those beings,
you talk about reptoids,

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.758 align:middle line:90%
and the mantids, and the Greys.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.594 align:middle line:84%
Did you find that
they are nefarious,

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.845 align:middle line:90%
as many people claim?

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.472 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I've had
both experiences.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.975 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences
which were terrible,

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:28.062 align:middle line:84%
and I've had experiences
which were very positive.

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:30.607 align:middle line:84%
So I really have come
to the conclusion

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.817 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
treat every alien--

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.557 align:middle line:84%
or I want to say, alien--
every being the same

00:11:35.557 --> 00:11:38.031 align:middle line:90%
as you would treat a human.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to treat
them with respect

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.367 align:middle line:90%
and honor right off the bat.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:90%
You don't show fear.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.746 align:middle line:84%
You don't-- you
just stay very calm.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:47.707 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some that are
very beneficial to you, which

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.753 align:middle line:84%
are great teachers, and there
are some that, like you say,

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:55.715 align:middle line:84%
want to take your energy and
use you and manipulate you,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.468 align:middle line:84%
which happens a lot in
the lower astral realms.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:02.013 align:middle line:84%
And I feel right now
in this industry,

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:05.516 align:middle line:84%
right now in this
time, many people

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:09.646 align:middle line:84%
are being taken by
these manipulations.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.105 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Speaking
of manipulations,

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.483 align:middle line:84%
there's an interesting
character to discuss,

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.018 align:middle line:90%
which is John Titor part two,

00:12:15.018 --> 00:12:15.818 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:16.653 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: The Second.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:19.948 align:middle line:84%
You co wrote this book
"Disclosed" about his story.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:24.702 align:middle line:84%
And obviously the first John
Titor, he's considered a fraud.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:27.121 align:middle line:84%
He appeared in 2000,
around 2000, 2001

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.165 align:middle line:90%
on these online internet blogs.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.959 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interesting,
compelling story

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.586 align:middle line:84%
of a future time traveler
who was sent to the past.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.922 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically
trying to warn people

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:38.591 align:middle line:84%
about coming world wars
and global conflicts

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.717 align:middle line:90%
and destruction.

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:43.262 align:middle line:84%
And then this John Titor the
Second appears, and I think

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.681 align:middle line:90%
you now consider him a fraud.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.226 align:middle line:84%
But what made you at first
believe him and then come

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:50.645 align:middle line:84%
to the realization that he
wasn't what he said he was?

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:54.691 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, just like
most people that have a really

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.735 align:middle line:84%
amazing story, they're
very charismatic.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:58.569 align:middle line:90%
They're very nice.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:59.779 align:middle line:90%
They have quite a story.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.866 align:middle line:84%
When I first spoke
to John the Second,

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.869 align:middle line:90%
his story was very believable.

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.872 align:middle line:84%
He started to relive war
stories that were in the future

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:10.915 align:middle line:90%
and in the past.

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was things I've
never heard before.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was completely different.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.589 align:middle line:84%
It was a completely different
story than the original John

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:19.389 align:middle line:90%
Titor.

00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:22.176 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you know what, talk
to my friend Bob Mitchell.

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.845 align:middle line:90%
He's a writer.

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.555 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke, and
they decided they

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:26.764 align:middle line:90%
were going to write the book.

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.808 align:middle line:90%
And my role was to--

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very good
graphic designer,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.479 align:middle line:84%
and I put all the
pieces together.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.315 align:middle line:84%
So we all worked together
to put this work together.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:40.653 align:middle line:84%
But within four months of
the book being released,

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:44.949 align:middle line:84%
his true identity got
leaked to a radio show.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.951 align:middle line:84%
And then it went all
over the internet,

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:51.831 align:middle line:84%
and he was basically
blacklisted from all the shows.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:52.749 align:middle line:90%
He's still out there.

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.543 align:middle line:84%
He's still claiming he's
John Titor the Second.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:14:00.965 align:middle line:84%
But we have found evidence
of his true identity

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:05.887 align:middle line:84%
and a very lengthy criminal
history that goes completely

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
counter to what he claims.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.935 align:middle line:84%
So I would consider what
he wrote fraudulent.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:16.981 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's lots
of truth in that book,

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:21.277 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what
sources he took that from.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.906 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually currently
working with Special Agent John

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.532 align:middle line:90%
DeSouza from the FBI.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
you've heard of him.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.788 align:middle line:84%
He's wrote-- he's written
a couple compelling books

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:90%
in this subject matter.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're working together now
with the FBI and FBI attorneys

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.256 align:middle line:84%
to look into this
character, because there's

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.718 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff he's doing in
the background that is not

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:49.306 align:middle line:84%
good for anybody,
so-- >> SEAN: What's

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:50.431 align:middle line:90%
with this name, John Titor?

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Why would he take
John Titor the Second?

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.353 align:middle line:84%
Didn't that tip
you off in a sense

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.647 align:middle line:84%
that maybe there was something
wrong, if the first John

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Titor was a fake?

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.858 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Yeah, well, you
know it's very interesting,

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.987 align:middle line:84%
because the original John Titor
always claimed that his name

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.489 align:middle line:90%
wasn't John Titor.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:11.828 align:middle line:84%
He was just using that as
an alias to protect himself.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:14.539 align:middle line:84%
But John Titor the Second
claims that John Titor

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.332 align:middle line:90%
is his real name.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:19.168 align:middle line:84%
So that's a real
tipoff right there.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.504 align:middle line:84%
And before I came
to see you, I'm

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.548 align:middle line:84%
thinking last
night in the hotel,

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.758 align:middle line:90%
what is this name John Titor?

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.094 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered this
character from the 60s.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:90%
His name is George Van Tassel.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.017 align:middle line:84%
And he has an amazing
story, a contact story where

00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.855 align:middle line:84%
a ship lands in his airfield
in the middle of the night

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:40.982 align:middle line:84%
and there's four beings,
which are humanoids,

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.275 align:middle line:90%
and they're humans.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.235 align:middle line:90%
They invite him on the ship.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:48.573 align:middle line:84%
And they tell him that they're
time travelers from the future.

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:52.326 align:middle line:84%
So he asks these time travelers,
how does time travel work?

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:53.828 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well,
it's quite easy.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:58.958 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the mathematical
formula for a time machine.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.294 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to write this
down for you, because I just

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.461 align:middle line:90%
figured this out last night.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So I might as well
break it on your show.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.344 align:middle line:84%
So his equation
was time, and then

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:18.311 align:middle line:84%
equals frequency, which most
people refer to as rate,

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 over time.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:30.072 align:middle line:84%
So this is the equation
that the time travelers

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:32.025 align:middle line:90%
gave George in the 60s.

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:32.825 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: OK.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.536 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: So I'm looking
at this, and I'm thinking,

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:44.003 align:middle line:84%
what if I take these words, and
I'm just going to write it out.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:56.724 align:middle line:84%
So if you take these
letters, R, 1, over time.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.643 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that an anagram for Titor?

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.478 align:middle line:90%
The formula for time travel.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:03.189 align:middle line:84%
What I'm thinking now
is the original John

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.851 align:middle line:84%
Titor, the original person
that wrote the John Titor--

00:17:05.851 --> 00:17:06.651 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.486 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: --knew
about this story,

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:11.489 align:middle line:84%
knew about the formula for
time travel that was given

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:12.615 align:middle line:90%
to George.

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.576 align:middle line:84%
And he took that and hid
it in the name Titor.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.118 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I'm right.

00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:18.537 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: It's
interesting, though.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.082 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: But hey, putting
some pieces together, possibly.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.042 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So when you hear claims
about other time travelers?

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, I'm thinking
like Andy Basiago.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.588 align:middle line:90%
He's a very famous one.

00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:29.548 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed him
for "Conspiracy Theory

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.758 align:middle line:90%
with Jesse Ventura."

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.677 align:middle line:84%
And this is a physical
time travel experience.

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:34.512 align:middle line:84%
You talk about multi
dimensional experiences.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But this is a physical
time travel experience.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.057 align:middle line:84%
Are you skeptical when you
hear stories like this?

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:38.857 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: I am.

00:17:38.857 --> 00:17:43.824 align:middle line:84%
I really am skeptical about
time travelers, but in a sense,

00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:47.275 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
it's real, right?

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:52.059 align:middle line:84%
The thing with whistleblowers
is that if you're

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:54.416 align:middle line:84%
a true whistleblower
coming out, you're

00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:56.826 align:middle line:84%
probably going to be
hunted down and killed.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:01.668 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line, that's kind of
what happens to you if you

00:18:01.668 --> 00:18:04.709 align:middle line:90%
know some really crazy stuff.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.508 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say that I raise
my eyebrow at whistleblowers

00:18:07.508 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that want to take pictures with
you and sell hats and t shirts.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.636 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So I have to ask
just because you're co writer

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:18.639 align:middle line:84%
on this book, actually on
both books, Bob Mitchell.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.182 align:middle line:90%
He passed away recently.

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:22.768 align:middle line:84%
Are you at all suspicious
about his passing?

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: I am.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.983 align:middle line:84%
And he was into more
things than he let on to.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.111 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a very
trusted person in the media,

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.822 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people gave
him classified things.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:38.034 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people thought that
they can share things with him.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:45.541 align:middle line:84%
And he went on CBS News in
June for the Alien Cosmic Expo.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:50.356 align:middle line:84%
And he went on there-- and this
is a very big national news

00:18:50.356 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
network, and basically
told them the truth

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.759 align:middle line:84%
from what his
understanding of the truth

00:18:54.759 --> 00:19:00.473 align:middle line:84%
was that the US military was
under the control of some type

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:90%
of alien influence.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.809 align:middle line:84%
And they control the
subject around the world.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.312 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a
government and there's

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.814 align:middle line:84%
no real democracy,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said this across
Canada, and there

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.404 align:middle line:84%
was no one there to
rebuttal his statements.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:19.992 align:middle line:84%
In the media, you need
balanced reporting, right?

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.788 align:middle line:84%
A couple of months after
he said that, he was dead.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And the type of
cancer that he had

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.918 align:middle line:84%
was pancreatic, which
is very aggressive.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.128 align:middle line:90%
But he found out.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
He was just saying he
had pain in his side.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they thought he
just had diabetes.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.426 align:middle line:84%
But when they
checked, they said,

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.387 align:middle line:90%
you have pancreatic cancer.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And then a week later, he
went to another doctor,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.266 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor said, well,
you also have liver cancer.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.893 align:middle line:84%
And then a week later,
they said, well,

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.311 align:middle line:90%
you also have stomach as well.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
this thing overtook

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.566 align:middle line:90%
his body in a couple of weeks.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:56.362 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this same thing
happen to other people that

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:57.446 align:middle line:90%
got too close.

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.572 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, here we have,
again, the nefarious

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.245 align:middle line:84%
influence of the
ET agenda, the idea

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.581 align:middle line:84%
that it has to be suppressed,
it has to be kept quiet.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.135 align:middle line:84%
From your perspective,
what is it

00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:11.853 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs, or the
extradimensional beings--

00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:15.306 align:middle line:84%
let's say they're beings--
want with Earth that they

00:20:15.306 --> 00:20:18.801 align:middle line:84%
have to be so discreet and
secretive about their presence?

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.262 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I think that they
need a portal into the physical

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:25.349 align:middle line:84%
world, and a human being
is basically a portal.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.978 align:middle line:84%
So they can overtake
people's minds, their bodies,

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:33.566 align:middle line:84%
or even place their
puppets in places of power.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:39.572 align:middle line:84%
And they can start almost having
many people be these puppets.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.867 align:middle line:84%
So they have now their
input into this Earth.

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.368 align:middle line:84%
The thing that we
don't understand

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:49.457 align:middle line:84%
about the human experience is
that we are so powerful that we

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.125 align:middle line:90%
can change realities.

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:52.918 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.213 align:middle line:84%
So using our intentions,
our hearts, our minds,

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.841 align:middle line:84%
we can envision and
dream our future.

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:02.678 align:middle line:84%
We can create any world we
want with our intentions.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.181 align:middle line:84%
And if they could
influence and manipulate

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.516 align:middle line:84%
our minds, our
bodies, our worlds,

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:10.553 align:middle line:84%
they could implant whatever
version of the future

00:21:10.553 --> 00:21:11.353 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:15.816 align:middle line:84%
And if we start to believe
that, then they win.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.568 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: That's a
pretty nefarious agenda.

00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:19.695 align:middle line:84%
What is the countervailing
force to that?

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.322 align:middle line:84%
What is the
counterbalancing faction

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to this dark agenda
that basically

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.826 align:middle line:90%
wants to manipulate humans?

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:29.413 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: It's to teach us that
we are those powerful beings.

00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:31.582 align:middle line:84%
See, right now, we're
kind of in a fog.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who we are.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.293 align:middle line:90%
We don't know our true power.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.671 align:middle line:84%
And we're just kind of
wandering around this planet,

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:40.799 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what we're
going to do day to day.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.719 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
agenda, is to keep us like.

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:47.806 align:middle line:84%
Give us 9:00 to 5:00 job,
all the bills, family,

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.768 align:middle line:84%
and pay the government,
so we don't have time

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.562 align:middle line:84%
to think about
anything, except that.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:57.826 align:middle line:84%
But the real truth is we're
so powerful that-- what if you

00:21:57.826 --> 00:22:02.577 align:middle line:84%
knew that the dream world was
the first step into the spirit

00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:05.113 align:middle line:84%
world, and you can
use that to travel

00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:07.212 align:middle line:84%
to other worlds,
dimensions through all

00:22:07.212 --> 00:22:10.743 align:middle line:84%
these portals and spider
webs through time and space,

00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:12.581 align:middle line:90%
and you're basically free?

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:14.333 align:middle line:84%
If you knew you're
free, you're eternal,

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.253 align:middle line:84%
and you can manifest
your own reality,

00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:18.921 align:middle line:90%
how can you be controlled?

00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:20.589 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: In your
experience and travels,

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that the US,
or let's say beyond the US,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.471 align:middle line:84%
maybe the elite have some kind
of secret space program taking

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:30.057 align:middle line:84%
place and that we're already
basically building ships

00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:33.978 align:middle line:84%
and working to travel
through the solar system?

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.689 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: From the research
that I've done personally,

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:39.984 align:middle line:84%
and this has to do
with Nikola Tesla,

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:45.072 align:middle line:84%
we had all the answers from
the 1900s to the 1920s.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Like we had anti gravity,
time travel, free energy.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.789 align:middle line:84%
We had technology to feed the
world, to end all wars back

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:55.374 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:22:55.374 --> 00:23:02.923 align:middle line:84%
So if that technology was
taken into the military hands,

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:04.425 align:middle line:90%
it's not used to free us.

00:23:04.425 --> 00:23:08.554 align:middle line:84%
It's use to keep us in
that current condition.

00:23:08.554 --> 00:23:10.806 align:middle line:84%
So do they have a
secret space program?

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:13.475 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure all the
technological programs

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:17.938 align:middle line:84%
that they have are secret,
including space travel.

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:21.567 align:middle line:84%
Because this technology is
definitely available to them.

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.527 align:middle line:90%
It's just not available to us.

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So let's talk
about advanced technology,

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:28.741 align:middle line:84%
because oftentimes people
will point us into the past

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:31.619 align:middle line:84%
to actually say, look
to things like crystals.

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Why are crystals, which are
basically, as I understand,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.166 align:middle line:84%
a natural computer-- they
can hold all this information

00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.294 align:middle line:84%
within them-- why are
they so important?

00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:42.087 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, if you
go back to Atlantis,

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:46.175 align:middle line:84%
there's all these theories or
past life regressions where

00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
they talk about that Atlantis
was powered by crystals.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.348 align:middle line:84%
And they would use the
crystals like different rubies

00:23:52.348 --> 00:23:57.686 align:middle line:84%
and sapphires and gems to
somehow take the solar energy

00:23:57.686 --> 00:24:02.358 align:middle line:84%
from the sun and transfer it
into a huge amount of power.

00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:04.894 align:middle line:84%
But today in our world, we're
using crystals for everything

00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:05.694 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:07.946 align:middle line:84%
All our technology is
based on silicon dioxide.

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:10.407 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
Silicon Valley.

00:24:10.407 --> 00:24:13.035 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
was a time in our past

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:16.038 align:middle line:84%
where we were so
advanced that there

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:19.166 align:middle line:84%
had to be a decision
made; continue

00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.627 align:middle line:84%
this technological
path and destroy

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:25.839 align:middle line:84%
the planet and ourselves,
or go back to nature.

00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.843 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking to a very
credible shaman who lives up

00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:33.597 align:middle line:84%
in the woods in Canada, who
just kind of keeps to himself,

00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:36.475 align:middle line:84%
and he was telling me a
story that his ancestors were

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:39.603 align:middle line:84%
so advanced that
they had spaceships,

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:44.024 align:middle line:84%
that they had technology
beyond anything we have today.

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:46.777 align:middle line:84%
And it was decided that
it was too destructive.

00:24:46.777 --> 00:24:49.822 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
factions of people.

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
They chose to take the
technology off world.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.661 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
left the planet.

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.788 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest
went back to nature

00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.749 align:middle line:84%
and lived with nature
as spiritual life.

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
And he said that periodically
through time, these ancestors

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:08.632 align:middle line:84%
of the human race would come
back in their spaceships

00:25:08.632 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and give their
ancestors a choice,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.472 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
come back with them,

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.182 align:middle line:84%
or would you like
to go back to nature

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:19.309 align:middle line:90%
and go back to the source?

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:23.063 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there's many
cities on the planet that

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:24.898 align:middle line:90%
are just deserted.

00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.151 align:middle line:84%
In our past, there's
all these populations

00:25:27.151 --> 00:25:28.736 align:middle line:90%
that just disappear.

00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:31.572 align:middle line:84%
And what he was telling me
is that these ancestors came,

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:34.742 align:middle line:84%
and those cities decided
to go with those ancestors.

00:25:34.742 --> 00:25:37.286 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But we are advancing
technologically on this planet.

00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:38.328 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean then?

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:39.955 align:middle line:84%
Are we hitting this
critical juncture

00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
where we have to decide
if we're going to go back

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.711 align:middle line:84%
to a more natural orientation,
or if we're going to continue

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.629 align:middle line:90%
to advance technologically?

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.757 align:middle line:84%
But isn't there a balance
between the two forces

00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:84%
where we don't basically end
up building death stars and war

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.137 align:middle line:90%
machines with our technology?

00:25:55.137 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We could actually use technology
like crystals and other things

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.101 align:middle line:84%
to be in actually more
harmony with nature.

00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:02.144 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: I believe that.

00:26:02.144 --> 00:26:05.063 align:middle line:90%
And I use crystals all the time.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:11.695 align:middle line:84%
And when you hold a crystal,
or use a crystal, what you're

00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:14.198 align:middle line:84%
doing is you're tapping
into this natural vibration

00:26:14.198 --> 00:26:18.076 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
universal time vibration.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:22.831 align:middle line:84%
And it hooks you into
this source field energy,

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
so you can have access
to all these things.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:90%
It awakens different DNA.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.005 align:middle line:84%
It amplifies your
electromagnetic fields.

00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I'm trying to
use crystals to find myself

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.552 align:middle line:90%
and to be better with myself.

00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:37.304 align:middle line:90%
But what was his name?

00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:39.014 align:middle line:90%
Marcel Vogel.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:41.475 align:middle line:84%
He once quoted,
saying, "If people

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:44.478 align:middle line:84%
found the secret of
crystals or if people

00:26:44.478 --> 00:26:47.564 align:middle line:84%
knew the power of a
crystal, it would either

00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:51.527 align:middle line:84%
end the world overnight,
or save the world."

00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:54.238 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're coming
to this critical junction

00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:57.866 align:middle line:84%
where the technology
is not going

00:26:57.866 --> 00:26:59.868 align:middle line:90%
to support our environment.

00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:03.413 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand that we
have to support our environment

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:05.749 align:middle line:90%
naturally to support ourselves.

00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:09.336 align:middle line:84%
We can use technology
to help support nature.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:11.922 align:middle line:84%
But right now we're
using technology

00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:15.676 align:middle line:84%
in the opposite way, which is
to destroy nature, which will,

00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:19.346 align:middle line:84%
if we don't change, it's
going to destroy us.

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.931 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen some
of those futures.

00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:24.601 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, you don't
want to go down that route.

00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:25.644 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: But it doesn't--

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:28.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you foresee
us actually learning

00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:29.773 align:middle line:90%
the lesson in a sense?

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.276 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem that we're
on a path of awakening

00:27:32.276 --> 00:27:34.111 align:middle line:84%
at this point, although
many people expected

00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:36.446 align:middle line:90%
we would be after 2012.

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:38.448 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: The truth
is I don't know.

00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:41.159 align:middle line:84%
The truth is everybody
is an individual,

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to see the
reality the way they see it.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.625 align:middle line:84%
We can only live by example
and try to get information out.

00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:52.462 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be a time
coming very soon where it

00:27:52.462 --> 00:27:55.007 align:middle line:90%
might be too late to turn back.

00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:56.925 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
have to use technology

00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:59.386 align:middle line:90%
in the other sense to save us.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.889 align:middle line:84%
So how can we use
technology now, or how

00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:04.433 align:middle line:84%
do we release the
hidden technology that's

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:09.104 align:middle line:84%
been kept from us to
help save this planet?

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.898 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: In terms of
your experiences with

00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:15.444 align:middle line:84%
the extradimensional beings, do
you not see them at any point

00:28:15.444 --> 00:28:19.406 align:middle line:84%
making their presence more felt
or known to basically help wake

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.575 align:middle line:84%
up many people who
are still sleeping?

00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.994 align:middle line:84%
Or is the idea that
people are not awake

00:28:23.994 --> 00:28:25.787 align:middle line:84%
enough to recognize
their presence,

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.665 align:middle line:84%
so they're not
going to interfere?

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.126 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: What the
extradimensional beings want

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:35.547 align:middle line:84%
people to understand is that
they're incarnating as human

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.506 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:38.216 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming
here, and they're being

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.969 align:middle line:90%
born very enlightened children.

00:28:40.969 --> 00:28:43.597 align:middle line:84%
And those enlightened
children, they're

00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:46.642 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are going to try
to make this shift and change,

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.269 align:middle line:84%
because they are the
extradimensional beings.

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:52.105 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: That's pretty
accurate, I think.

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:53.732 align:middle line:84%
What is your plan,
as far as the work

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:57.027 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing, in
spreading the message?

00:28:57.027 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: You know, I think the
reason all this stuff happened

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.659 align:middle line:84%
to me was so that I can
share it from a very balanced

00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:04.743 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.079 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't really
grow up in any religion.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:10.749 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know anything
about politics or conspiracies.

00:29:10.749 --> 00:29:12.292 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
any of this stuff

00:29:12.292 --> 00:29:14.336 align:middle line:84%
until I started to
see it firsthand.

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:16.672 align:middle line:84%
So I think just by
sharing and being

00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:19.299 align:middle line:84%
open about my
personal experiences

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.469 align:middle line:84%
helps many others come
forward, because I've

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:26.223 align:middle line:84%
been told that there's
actually a million plus people

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:29.393 align:middle line:84%
just like me that are going
through the exact same process

00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:30.686 align:middle line:90%
that I've been through.

00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:32.938 align:middle line:84%
And I get emails all
the time from people

00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:35.691 align:middle line:84%
saying what happened to
you is identical to what's

00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:37.067 align:middle line:90%
happened to me.

00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:40.195 align:middle line:84%
So I know these multi
dimensional beings

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:46.076 align:middle line:84%
have been incarnating here
since the 70s at least.

00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:50.539 align:middle line:84%
And they are positively changing
the course of our timelines.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:52.708 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, it's good
to have you as a spokesman.

00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.376 align:middle line:90%
Many people can relate with.

00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.378 align:middle line:84%
And I wish you luck
in the journey.

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:58.296 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me today, Jason.

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:00.048 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: We appreciate it.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.342 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:04.177 align:middle line:84%
Some fascinating insights
from Jason Quitt.

00:30:04.177 --> 00:30:06.638 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here,

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:09.182 align:middle line:84%
but I urge you to check out
his book "Forbidden Knowledge,

00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.727 align:middle line:84%
Revelations of a Multi
Dimensional Time Traveler."

00:30:11.727 --> 00:30:14.229 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path
