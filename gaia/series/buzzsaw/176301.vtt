Energy manipulation.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.160 align:middle line:90%
We can all do it.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.550 align:middle line:90%
But do we dare?

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.544 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:20.666 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAN: Welcome to Buzzsaw,
where we cut through

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:10%
the mainstream narrative to
explore the twilight zones

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:10%
of reality.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is Sarah Adams,
multidimensional coach, speaker,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and intuitive healer.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We'll be discussing energy
manipulation and much more.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, I want to
start by asking you,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
how did you discover
your path, in particular,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to a multidimensional
understanding of your soul

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and also your
abilities as a coach?

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>> SARAH ADAMS: So
I am very blessed,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:10%
because I came in from past
lives with understanding about

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:10%
my soul and being very
protective of that soul energy.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, coming
to this world,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:90%
that I chose to come here.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I would have to
protect my energy here and also

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
explain to people that they
have this energy field.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And this energy
field, it's magical.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%
It's divine.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of
God Source itself.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.694 align:middle line:90%
And it's within them.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And they needed to get in touch
with that and tap into it.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And even just like
emptying out a glass,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
we can get depleted of energy.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways of
re-instilling that energy

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So I knew very much coming to
this world my mission on it.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.856 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
what started me.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of
work done energetically

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
affects the whole world, because
it affects the consciousness.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot of
work in that area,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
just for hours and
sometimes days.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
It's what I spend
most of my time doing.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You mentioned this idea
of protecting the energy from

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:90%
being depleted.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What are some basic
things that people should be

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
aware of in terms of
protecting their soul energy?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So there
are two things.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
We can create sort of a sphere
around us to protect ourselves.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can do this
through thought.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, to imagine
something, you're

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
literally-- when you
imagine something, an image,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
you're condensing
energy into that image

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.087 align:middle line:84%
and giving it life in
the energetic realms.

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can protect
yourself like that,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
so by reinforcing a sort
of cocoon, a golden cocoon,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
around yourself.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to
always keep that on.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
collect energy, whether sun

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
gazing or instilling chi
energy into yourself,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you can go ahead and become an
energy gate, a giver of light

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
or a giver of energy,
light, energy, frequency,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:90%
sound, all the same.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
So you can open that up.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And if there are people
who are sick around you

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
or people who are depleted
in energy in any manner, even

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
people who are depressed,
people who are suicidal,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.004 align:middle line:84%
all those people, they are
just depleted in energy.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And if they were
given the energy,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:90%
they would not be suicidal.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
They would not be sick.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:90%
They would not be depressed.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you can open that up
and give them that energy--

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of course, that
takes some exercises.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I often use
the different rainbow colors.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I go through doing the
different colors around myself.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
When we started this interview,
I had a bit of anxiety.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So I did blue and
green, because I

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
want to open my heart
during this interview

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.509 align:middle line:84%
to explain to people
how they can get

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their soul
energy, and how they can

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:90%
use that to heal their lives.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these spiritual
beliefs in life, and books,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and whatever, religions,
all of these things.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're keeping people from
accessing the truth within.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's their energy.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And whenever they open this
up, it relieves everything.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I go in states where I
just, most of the time, I'm

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
in bliss and happiness.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
worries of life, which

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
are low energy, or
entities, or all that,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.289 align:middle line:84%
they don't reach you when
you're in that state.

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Because you
raise your vibrations.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
You're flying, thus, in
the angel wings, where

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:90%
it didn't mean that being--

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%
everybody is an angel in a way.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.427 align:middle line:84%
They all have wings
that they can fly above.

00:04:24.427 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's through energy.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You can fly above once
you access the energy

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.176 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So it
seems to me that--

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: --the chaos.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --the emotions and
the energy are very intertwined

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:90%
in a certain sense.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.629 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional bodies
and our energy bodies

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:90%
are very interconnected.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
gateways, or the pathways,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
into the other
dimensions of reality.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what do those
dimensions of reality--

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:84%
what do they look
like, for example?

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Can we interact with
them on a daily basis?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes, we can.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I know that just recently
an article came out

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that said there was 11
dimensions that they discovered

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're interacting with.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
People who don't have orange, or
yellow, or green in their aura,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
they won't have
bliss, or happiness,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
or even their heart won't be
open, because the green is so--

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
imagine that in the future
we're going to have--

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:90%
we have hospitals.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
places where people

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
are healed through
energy, because they're

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
going to realize that
the lack of colors are--

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that colors and
emotions go together.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Green, your heart energy.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Orange, bliss, happiness.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.175 align:middle line:90%
So they all go together.

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And to access higher realms,
you have to have all of that.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
the rainbow body

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
access higher realms,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
because you need to have all the
beautiful emotions, like bliss,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
happiness.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is that
makes you go high in energy.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And you can access other realms.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, I
do see that humanity

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.197 align:middle line:90%
will discover its soul energy.

00:05:54.197 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And they will
understand how it works.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And they will understand that
emotions, emotion, motion

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of energy, it has motion in
there, the motion of energy,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that these are the key.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Higher emotions are
the key to accessing

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:90%
higher states of being.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Recently, I was with a shaman.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
There was a lady next to me.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And she was just saying,
I love everybody.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And I forgive people.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel intense
love for everybody.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her
after, he said to her

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
after the whole
experience, he said,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that is the state that the very
people throughout history, who

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
were spiritual, or
who were very, very

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
advanced in spirituality
on any level, that

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
was the state of
being one with God.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they were always
trying to be, at that state.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have any sort of
negative emotions at all.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
She just was in a
higher state of being.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And you can achieve that.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So I mean, certainly
sound and light, we know music,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.457 align:middle line:84%
obviously, is very influential
on our emotions and directly

00:07:02.457 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:90%
connects us to emotional states.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We know sound and light can
be very helpful for healing

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:90%
or for bringing us down.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But what does it have to do
with the actual dimensionality

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
of this existence beyond this
realm that we're inhabiting?

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So we're in
a color, sound prison.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's evident walking around.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:90%
You see nature.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
When you go into
nature, it's vibrant.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
There's so many hues of colors.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrant.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's very well
known that nature

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.825 align:middle line:90%
is part of God Source itself.

00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It's God Source.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:90%
So think about it.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
We build cities, where
everything is bleak.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And we live in very
bleak apartment places,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
in these squares that are
just built out of these very--

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in such a thing
as light as evil or darkness.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I just believe in a lack
of light, a lack of color.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Color, light, vibration,
sound, frequency, all of those,

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
from my experiences,
those are all one.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's just
this deficit in mass cities.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.927 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder why in these
cities people become depressed

00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the lack
of the whole rainbow light

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
spectrum within
their aura systems,

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:90%
within their chakra systems.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It's depleted.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But how would that be
affected by another dimension

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
of reality?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Or how would that look in
basically an altered state

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: OK.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
And when you are depleted
in energy, what you do

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
is you just go down.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when you go down,
there's lower parasitic things

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And those are going
to attach to you.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it's negative at all.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's just
saying, hey, you know what?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.979 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to wake you up.

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost when you cut
yourself and that hurts.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.436 align:middle line:84%
These parasitic
beings are saying,

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
there is a problem here.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.697 align:middle line:90%
You need to fix this.

00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You are not taking care
of your soul energy.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking care
of your soul body.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And this all correlates
to multidimensionality,

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
because then we go
back into the Bible.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph had a
coat of many colors.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And he walked and
talked with God.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
He was multidimensional.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And then there's so much work
about the Rainbow Serpent,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
the Rainbow Tribe.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.722 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of work
on that that was done.

00:09:25.722 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Now what I can tell you is for
the highest dimensions, what

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.263 align:middle line:84%
you have to do is you have
to achieve every color.

00:09:30.263 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
And then gold comes around.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can travel to
the highest dimensions.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.704 align:middle line:90%
Now think about it.

00:09:35.704 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
To go to higher
dimensions, if you

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.352 align:middle line:84%
had parasitic things that
were attached to you,

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't want you there.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.351 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't want you
to bring that there.

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
That's like a sickness,
energetic sickness,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that you need to look
at, take care of,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and face, and heal from.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to colors, and when

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
it comes to sound frequency,
light, and multidimensions,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
you can't access
higher dimensions

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have those
colors within your field.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And each color, as a dimension,
has different dimension

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%
spectrums within it.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So the universe and
creation, universes, it's

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
just mass the creation that
is there when I access energy,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
when I use the energy system
to access multidimensionality

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
or dimensions.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: In terms of
the ancient world,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.279 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned Joseph and
the multicolored coat.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:33.319 align:middle line:84%
And basically you're saying
this is symbolic of--

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: His aura.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --him having the
rainbow colors of the energy

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But was there, indicated by
the pyramids and ancient sites,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
indications of an
ancient technology system

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that actually utilized
light and sound,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how even
the energy was generated

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and how humans maybe were more
tapped into their energy soul

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:90%
bodies than we are currently?

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So the pyramid,
the pyramid points energy.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
a funnel of energy.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember is that
priests and priestesses,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
they would go and sit
in there and meditate.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And that would funnel energy
right directly into them.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I also know that
many monuments were

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:90%
used to transport or teleport.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So you could either go
out of your body and use

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that to transport yourself
to other universes,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
other dimensions.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
This helped with that.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.255 align:middle line:90%
Or you could even teleport.

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
There were very
advanced civilizations.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
They lived, basically,
off of light.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%
It's like Lemuria.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I was in this meditation.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the word Lemuria go
to luminous and illuminated.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the word
Lemuria turn into that.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:90%
And Atlantis, a light.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
It was enlightened.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis literally changed into
a light and then enlightened.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So these civilizations
knew exactly how

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:90%
light technology worked.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.972 align:middle line:84%
And they used it in correlation
to their soul energy.

00:12:07.972 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they would
live for a very long time,

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
because they could put
energy back into themselves.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They knew when they
were depleted in energy.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So they would stay
in a high state

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
of being for thousands
and thousands of years,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
because they knew exactly
how their souls work.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because in the word soul,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
you do have S-O-L. And in
French, sole, the light.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then we go
to the Egyptians,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
who were sun worshippers
or light worshippers.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what is the, or I
should say, if you have one,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful sacred
site that you've visited?

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.758 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: I have this belief.

00:12:43.758 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of these sacred
sites are very important.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But I have this belief
when it comes to that,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that our souls are
more important.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main thing
that really needs just

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to be accessed.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's amazing to
travel to those places.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And they retain that
energy from civilizations

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:90%
that were very illuminated.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, what I'm
trying to teach humanity

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't have to go
in a church, like religion,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have
to go here or there.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
You can sit there and experience
God, or the divine within, just

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.405 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter where you are.

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if you're
sleeping on the street.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if you have nothing.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
This Divine Source does
not see things like--

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: It doesn't judge
based on physical appearance,

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:84%
or physical wealth, and
these types of things.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: It's there waiting for
people, even all these people.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.302 align:middle line:84%
It's there waiting for
them to tap into it.

00:13:39.302 --> 00:13:41.801 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But do you think maybe
that's why the ancient sites

00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:90%
were powered down?

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.207 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it was like a
test to basically say, OK.

00:13:45.207 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
We're going to shift things now.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.926 align:middle line:84%
We're going to shut down
these power centers.

00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're now going to
basically, in a sense,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
blindfold you and let
you go to the next level

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
of understanding, which is, as
you say, going back to the soul

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
within each of us to be
able to actually take

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
the sovereignty
within ourselves.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we can look at those
ancient civilizations and say

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.163 align:middle line:84%
they may have been
very knowledgeable.

00:14:05.163 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
But they still had a hierarchy.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They still had people that
were probably starving,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that were living in poverty
compared to the rulers.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.187 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: I don't remember that.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I remember that
everybody was so evolved

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that there was no place
to use or abuse others.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So why were the
ancient sites shut down?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So the Earth
is functioning as a ship.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's functioning in a much
lower vibration right now.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And too many of
these ancient sites,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
too, also funneled
energy directly

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
into the core of the Earth to,
as a ship, bring it up or down.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
There were groups that knew
exactly how this functioned.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And they would keep that
functioning at a high level.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
What I do feel is that, yes,
all of this is done right now.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's all in a divine plan.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.944 align:middle line:84%
And I spend a lot of time
interacting with this force.

00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I can say it's
all in a divine plan,

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
because the more that people
shut down, I've noticed,

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.439 align:middle line:90%
they're shut down by whatever.

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Around the world,
I know that they're

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.404 align:middle line:90%
looking for alternative things.

00:15:16.404 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're waking up.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The pressure is literally
pressuring them to wake up.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, humanity,
they will find their souls.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%
And they will overcome.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it will be such
an amazing thing.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
have to-- before you

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:84%
can experience sunshine, you
have to experience the storm.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
The sun only comes
out after the storm.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: After the dark.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of these ancient
sites, monuments, and whatnot,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:90%
are they like light vehicles?

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.877 align:middle line:90%
You called them light vehicles.

00:15:53.877 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
In the different
dimension of reality,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
you can still see the
light that they emit?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: They actually are
connected to other dimensions.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them go
directly to cities

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:90%
and other dimensions of light.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So they're still
connected to those places.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been to one pyramid that
the bottom of the pyramid, it's

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:90%
as a diamond's almost shaped.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would
say diamond-shaped.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And I went into the pyramid.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the light
around it, it's

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
just sort of a spinning
or a cyclone movement.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it pulled me
into this other realm.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was sort of locked
to get into that other realm.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But I had to have enough
light within myself to pass.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So there are gateways that
you can't pass unless you

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:90%
have those energy codes.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the world can
access any of this technology.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They just need to gather the
energy within themselves.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
There is no hierarchy in this.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this was left, too,
by very ancient, high beings.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
They knew a lot of
stuff would come.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So it was a gift to
humanity, but only

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.621 align:middle line:90%
once humanity finds their souls.

00:17:10.621 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And now what
is the biggest risk

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:13.183 align:middle line:90%
you've experienced?

00:17:13.183 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
You talk about going to other
cities and other dimensions.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.404 align:middle line:84%
Is there a risk to these kind
of dimensional astral travels?

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.222 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Many people maybe
never come back from them.

00:17:21.222 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: People are
very, very powerful.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they give
their power away a lot.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a problem
with the world.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is
absolutely powerful.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And they have this energy
field that, literally,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.263 align:middle line:84%
no matter what dark
thing that there

00:17:34.263 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
is, it'll come from the heart.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:90%
And it'll just wipe it out.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I had a beautiful
experience not long ago.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I was in somebody's
subconscious.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all these
negative, parasitic beings,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
which this person created,
because, what I explained

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
about the image, they had
issues that they weren't

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:90%
healing within themselves.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.092 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was insecurities,
or whether it was self-harm,

00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
they were not
healing these issues.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So they were creating these
negative images, very powerful

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:90%
within their subconscious.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:90%
That was then attacking them.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It was only attacking them to
say there's a problem here.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
You need to take care of this.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.171 align:middle line:90%
So I was in their subconscious.

00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And the things they would--

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
like I said, worse
than a horror movie

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:90%
some of the stuff that I see.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not scared though.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So I was in their subconscious.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember, I always
keep my heart very, very open.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And this wave came out.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And it would hit these different
parasitic, quote, "beings."

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, they would
turn into these little flowers

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and smile.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.994 align:middle line:84%
And they would
just start turning

00:18:38.994 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
into beautiful little
things and just smile.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
And my heart was literally--

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
the field of my heart was
changing, transforming

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that into something beautiful.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have power over
all of this stuff.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, I've
been through a lot in life.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, that's what
got me through all of it

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
is my heart.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And all the work that
I've done to open my heart

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
has been extremely worth
it, because at one point,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I did get into some trouble.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've always kept
that since a child.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that there is
magic in children.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:90%
You see them.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.623 align:middle line:90%
They just love everything.

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything's beautiful to them.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And they can just
cheer people up.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:90%
And they just bring that energy.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It's their hearts.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Their hearts are so open.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And we can heal by
opening our hearts.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:90%
And we can heal others.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We can even go into
their energy fields

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.714 align:middle line:90%
and help them face those demons.

00:19:34.714 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And when everybody joins
together in the world

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.785 align:middle line:84%
and starts doing this,
all of that dark veil,

00:19:39.785 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
or curtain, that's
over humanity,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:90%
it's just going to slip away.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And one of the things
that I'm most fascinated by is

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
your analysis of films,
and movies, and television,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and how you decode messages
within entertainment.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it appeals to
the hearts of the masses.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:90%
You've told me.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.616 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you've
talked about this,

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
but how you see your character
within certain stories.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people actually

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
do see themselves within films.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, there's
an intentionality

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
behind the mythologies that
are being created constantly.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.885 align:middle line:90%
Who is behind this messaging?

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: It's
literally yourself.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Oh, in collective
unconsciousness?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: The world
is as a crystal ball.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything reflects back.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Light always reflects back.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's
a writer, they're

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:84%
going to stream in that
energy, because all information

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%
is an energy.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And well, information
flows freely.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So even if the person's
across the world,

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.898 align:middle line:84%
they might be writing
a story about them,

00:20:37.898 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're tuned into
energy, how energy works.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And they might not
even know themselves.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:90%
So everything reflects back.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Looking at your reflection
is very, very important.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So just as these parasitic
beings reflect different parts

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of you, you're going to
see reflections everywhere

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
you go of yourself and
of those close to you.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from you.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So then you might see
a movie where it shows

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that you're a very good person.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a reflection of, maybe,
you being a good person.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You might see a show where it
shows that, oh, your characters

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:90%
may be a bit darker.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.017 align:middle line:84%
And that's saying, hey,
look, there are some things

00:21:17.017 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
you need to fix right now.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like the parasitic
beings in your subconscious,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:90%
that happens on a 3D level too.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to say there are
all these forces that

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%
have power over humanity.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But humanity, in the end,
they are very powerful.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And we have power over
all of those things.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And they have that.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And they create and cast
their own realities.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And they are creators.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
They are literal creators and
very, very powerful creators.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's creating this
web around the world, yes.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And it's also being
reflected because of our DNA.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.175 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you've said
DNA is a fractal antenna

00:21:57.175 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
in the electromagnetic fields.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you're
alone in saying that.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It derives from other
theories about the nature

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
of DNA and the idea
that it's basically

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%
not only emitter of light.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And if light is
information, basically, it

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:90%
stores light and also emits it.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But how do you see that concept
of an antenna operating?

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So what I'll
do is I'll see the DNA.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll feel it, see it.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And then what I'll do is I'll
just pull energy right into it.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It's very good just to
lay down and do that.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:90%
So you imagine the DNA.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And you pull the
energy right into it.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice
it'll turn gold.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more that energy
comes into your DNA,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:90%
the more that it turns golden.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So you might see your
eye color change.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.967 align:middle line:84%
You might see your
facial features change.

00:22:46.967 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:84%
There are different
things that you'll

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.924 align:middle line:84%
see from pulling
energy into you,

00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
because energy heals
different parts of you

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.362 align:middle line:84%
and transforms them to your
original state of being.

00:22:55.362 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And most people in
the world, they're not

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
living with the amount
of energy they should.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when that enters them,
you'll see different changes.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I think there are some
web series I've seen.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And a person did
some work on this.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So DNA, the spiral
staircase is symbolic.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Where you can go up
and down the staircase

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
is symbolic of the DNA.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the golden, spiral
staircase, which is symbolic.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the--

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.692 align:middle line:84%
what is it? --the
Fibonacci in nature.

00:23:27.692 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: The curves of light.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Right.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So then we realize that
every single plant,

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
every single animal,
every single living

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
being on this Earth has DNA
in it that's pulling energy.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
way it can be alive.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way a tree can
be alive is because of this.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
It has its own DNA that
is an antenna that's

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
pulling all of the mass
energy within the universe.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's pulling this into
it and charging itself.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it can stay
vibrant, and beautiful,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and be alive.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
symbolism of DNA,

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the
Bible, the Tower of Babel.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:90%
That's all about DNA.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot--

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --the
fracturing of it then?

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: So this is the
thing with the Tower of Babel.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:84%
The whole story is quite
encoded, because Nimrod,

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
rod again, so we
got the DNA again.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead of giving
the information,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
Nimrod had information

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:84%
within his field from previous,
when there was a lot of,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
quote, "the fall of humanity,"
and frequency, or so on.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead of telling them
how to light themselves up,

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.159 align:middle line:90%
he was making them give his--

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: He was pulling--

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: He was
pulling their energy.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: He was vampiric.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Right.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
So that he could reach God.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Now energy, the more
energy you have in you,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you can become multidimensional
and reach the higher realms.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Become
more enlightened.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Right.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to
steal his way, in a way,

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to God or to the high,
quote, "God Source"

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:90%
energy, the high realms.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what he was doing is
he was an energy vampire.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:84%
He was stealing all the
energy and lighting his DNA up

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:90%
so that he could go up.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: I see.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Now this is quite
against the laws.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:90%
There are certain laws.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And you might say
they're energetic laws.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And they play into order.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite
against that, because one

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:84%
must become a giver of
energy, not a taker of energy.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: One must
become a soul-- a sun.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.614 align:middle line:84%
>> ADAMS: A sun, yes, and
give light to others, yes.

00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And that seems to me
the essence of your message.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I really want to empower people
and say, listen, no matter

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
where you are in life,
just stop, sit down,

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:90%
get in touch with your soul.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Do these exercises, pour
energy into yourself,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:90%
buy more fruits and vegetables.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:90%
They're filled with chi energy.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Do more sun gazing.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Do these things to bring
this energy into yourself.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And you won't be
depressed anymore.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Things will start to
change in your life.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
As you change the frequency,
you will extremely, extremely

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.677 align:middle line:90%
You won't even remember.

00:26:09.677 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Years down the road,
you'll look back.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.926 align:middle line:84%
And you won't even
remember that person,

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
because that was a
different frequency.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just want people--
because so many people

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:90%
are suffering in the world.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.335 align:middle line:90%
They're hopeless.

00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:24.367 align:middle line:84%
They looked for God
in all these places.

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But they failed to look
for God within themselves.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:84%
They're a piece
of God themselves.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to know
that they can access that.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
No matter where they are or what
state they're in, that there's

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:90%
still hope for them.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a
lot of other realms

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other beings
that want them to connect,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and that are waiting for
them to interact with them,

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.679 align:middle line:84%
and just applauding
them on all the time.

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
There's so many beings that
are applauding humanity on.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we focus on the
bad ones too much.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAN: Yes.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:10%
>> ADAMS: We don't focus on all
of the beautiful beings that

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:10%
are applauding humanity on.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But the good days
are more than the bad days.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.737 align:middle line:84%
So it's just easier to
focus on the bad days.

00:27:06.737 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But, as you said, there's
more beauty than not, I think,

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.304 align:middle line:90%
in this reality.

00:27:10.304 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
