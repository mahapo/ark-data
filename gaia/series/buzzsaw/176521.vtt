>> SEAN STONE: Energy
manipulation, we can all do it,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.517 align:middle line:90%
but do we dare?

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.520 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:21.455 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore the
twilight zones of reality.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:10%
is Bridget Nielsen, author,
intuitive healer, and chef.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Her insights on how
to use diet to raise

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
our energetic vibration,
as well as protect us

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:84%
from malevolent agendas,
are some of the topics

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:90%
we will be discussing.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So Bridget, I want to
start by asking you,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
you talk about a high
vibrational diet,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:90%
but what does that mean?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.456 align:middle line:10%
>> BRIDGET NIELSEN: It
really means just coming back

00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:10%
into connection with our vessel.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:10%
So clearing our vessel so the
spirit can really come in,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:10%
and we can be our true selves.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
many different things

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in our world and
toxins and such,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:90%
that we've gotten off course.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
changes our genetic--

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.207 align:middle line:90%
epigenetic disposition.

00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's really just
coming back into balance

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
so that we can radiate, turn
on, our extrasensory perceptions

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.347 align:middle line:90%
and be who we came here to be.

00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah, this is a topic--

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a word, embodiment,
coming into embodiment,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot recently.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
resonates with me

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of basically
many people would say

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
they're spiritual,
but oftentimes they

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.203 align:middle line:90%
get outside of their body.

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And they forget that our body
is actually like the main vessel

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.048 align:middle line:90%
that we're operating through.

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:30.317 align:middle line:84%
So how do we basically use the
body to embody our soul, right?

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that the concept?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Totally.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
fully in our body,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
then it's actually
much more comfortable.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think as
sensitives and empaths,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
there is this idea
that kind of escapism

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
or are leaving the body is
actually more comfortable.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we create a
space that's a temple,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:90%
then it's comfortable.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part
of the disassociation,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
as a little bit of
unrest or things

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that aren't quite
clean so that we don't

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:90%
feel like we can fully come in.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.095 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
there's basically

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.020 align:middle line:84%
a certain blockage that takes
place, either through foods,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but oftentimes, that
can connect to emotions.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Even the organs can connect
to certain emotions, right?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.016 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
there's always been

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
an association
between the organs,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the planets, our
emotional states, right?

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Exactly, yeah.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And so you've put out
a call to starseeds that is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the time to bloom.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.331 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is your
conception of a starseed?

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:21.205 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Starseed.

00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.115 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going
to go with the idea

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that there's multiple
incarnations.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to set
that as the standard

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
for this conversation.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:90%
But the idea is--

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
so we commonly hear
about incarnating

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
as different humans
in different times,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
but we also incarnate on
different planets outside

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:90%
of Earth.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so a starseed is
someone that-- a soul--

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that has incarnated off planet.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And in those off
planet incarnations,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
usually, it's a higher
density experience.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming from
a higher frequency.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So a starseed is someone
that's had those higher

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
dimensional experiences, and
then is incarnating into Earth,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
while being able to maintain
some of that higher frequency

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to assist her during this
transformational time.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Mm-hmm.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same concept of
what the hybrid is in your mind?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: So some of them
that have had contact with

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials, like
contact with abduction kind

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of experiences, through those
experiences kids were made from

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So from our genetic material and
from extraterrestrial genetics,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and then that creates hybrids.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.125 align:middle line:84%
So those are the hybrids
that I'm talking about.

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So a hybrid would
physically look different than

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:90%
a normal human?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:84%
They've been kind of altered
to look more human so

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:90%
that we're comfortable with it.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But as the different
generations happen

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and as contact comes into
more full swing on Earth,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
there will be more kind
of odd looking hybrids.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But for right now, they've
made them more human

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
so that we don't freak out.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: There have always
been pretty odd looking humans.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, that's true.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Alien humans.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.235 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: As far
as the starseeds,

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
the starseeds are a bit like
what people have called indigos

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --you know, basically
children of the new age.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.078 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, definitely.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And I feel the
connection to the indigo

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and the crystal
and rainbow waves

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
are just these new light
frequencies coming in.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.224 align:middle line:84%
And so as each generation--
so say like our parents

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
or grandparents-- they
came in, and maybe were

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:90%
the first wave of indigos.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But they were also
starseeds at the same time.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So as these waves of these
higher vibrations come in,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
it really just allows us access
to remember more of these star

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
connections and these
higher vibrations,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
like we are right now
by talking about them.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Precisely.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And so how much of the
population would you suppose

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.364 align:middle line:90%
are actually starseeds?

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: I would say that
it's a lesser percentage than

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
you'd think, but more.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends on where
people's soul is oriented.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you're like in a war torn
country or something like that,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.695 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to have the soul

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
availability of exploring
like higher dimensions

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.555 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You're too much focused
on the physical realm to be

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
able to have that
spiritual exploration.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.333 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:06.334 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that the people,
that the different cultures,

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and the different peoples
around the world that have

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
more availability and
are privileged with that

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%
get to explore that.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And so thus they're
more of a starseed type.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.715 align:middle line:84%
So I would say at least 10%
to 20% of the population

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:19.515 align:middle line:90%
are starseeds.

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Do you think that
Americans might be more

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
of a hub for starseeds because
of the plan that goes back

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.214 align:middle line:90%
to the Masonic plan.

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Manly Hall wrote about this.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
America was designed to be
the new Atlantis, essentially.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.837 align:middle line:10%
And so maybe like there are
more incarnations of starseeds

00:05:33.837 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:10%
taking place here because of the
actual design of what America

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:10%
was meant to be.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.743 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: I would agree, yeah.

00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And also in Europe, too.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Those two places.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's also
like a karmic renewal,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the people
that incarnated in America

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and Europe are Atlantean and
have those kind of connections,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as they've done
kind of not so good things,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:90%
like off planet as well.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the time for
us to kind of redeem ourselves

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
karmically, I would
say, in those locations,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:90%
people incarnating there.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And so we've come back.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, OK,
let's really re-orient,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
balance everything, and
do it right this time.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.583 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
But I'm curious.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So how did this end
up occurring to you?

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
As far as like in
your life, did you

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
have memories since
you were a child

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:90%
of being on other planets?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Or how did this journey
of awakening occur?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up
and I knew instantly

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%
that I was incredibly empathic.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely had senses and
could connect with other realms

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It was very comfortable for me.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that got kind of
washed out in school and stuff

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But once I got out
of the school system,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:84%
there is a direct
correlation between me just

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
remembering and waking
up and just reclaiming.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And all these experiences
that I did have as a kid

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had forgotten-- as
I was a kid that I forgot.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.159 align:middle line:84%
And then it just all
came flooding back.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, this is
what you're meant to do.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
talk about these things

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and remember all
these experiences.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.031 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And in your
experience then,

00:06:57.031 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
diet played a role in terms
of your ability to channel,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
to remember, to sort of be fluid
with the spiritual universe

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:90%
beyond?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, there's
a direct correlation,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say, in all people, of
us being able to turn on this

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
kind of genetic disposition
of the ever higher aspect,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and then diet being
able to assist that.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And for me, just
circumstantially,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I was raised vegetarian.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.585 align:middle line:84%
And that was always a
big theme of kind of,

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
go in this direction.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Go in this direction.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And it always has
really allowed me to be

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:90%
capable of perceiving more.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But so I mean in terms
of the high vibration diet,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean certainly you're
referring to vegetables,

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
things that are basically
full of chlorophyll, right?

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Fueled by the sun.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But you really-- I mean, what
else would you describe as sort

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:90%
of high vibrational foods?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Vibrational, high
vibrational foods

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
would be anything
that is full of life.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So reinvigorated with life,
or with healthy bacteria, too.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So you could think of
like nuts and seeds.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.169 align:middle line:84%
So sprouting, stuff like that,
that brings it back to life.

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been programmed
kind of since the '50s that you

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:90%
boil it.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
You kill it because there's
bacteria and it's bad.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of bringing
back bacteria, bringing back

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:90%
enzymes.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So like through
fermentation, right?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's
easily digestible

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that has a higher nutrient
density absorption.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
All those kinds of
things so that we

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
can get everything
our body needs

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and get all of that energy,
so the higher frequency.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:10%
And we can see that
even in organic

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:10%
versus conventional food
with Kirlian photography.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.628 align:middle line:10%
There's a direct-- you
can see it visually.

00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:35.294 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAN: There's more
color, more light.

00:08:35.294 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:10%
>> NIELSEN: Exactly.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.737 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And so this
play of basically diet,

00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
would you say that it
matters whether or not

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.028 align:middle line:84%
you're a starseed or not, like
that at all humans should be

00:08:45.028 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
applying it because it will help
them to embody here and access

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:90%
their soul?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
it's not like we're

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
saying if you're not a
starseed, you don't have a soul

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.888 align:middle line:90%
and you have a consciousness.

00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have off
world experiences.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Right.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Obviously, all beings
have some kind of past life

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
experiences and are seeded
from other star systems.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Or is it only these starseeds?

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: I would say that
most souls have had some

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:90%
experience out there.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it's really
important for all people

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to orient to a balanced diet
or a high vibrational diet

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
because it'll just make
their life much better.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Because there's parasites.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
crazy things in our gut

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that actually
determine our thoughts,

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and make us have these
certain emotions,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:90%
have these certain thoughts.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So it'll just make life better
to actually balance the diet,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and it'll make us happier.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.059 align:middle line:90%
So it just makes life better.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But it does seem that
there's a bit of a conspiracy,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
you could say, a
conscious attempt,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to actually keep the population
at a lower vibration through

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
certain foods.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whether it's
GMOs and toxins,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and just overall like bad diets.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What do
you see happening?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: I would
definitely agree.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just an attempt to
keep us from realizing

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
our true potential,
like that we truly

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
are source creators, and then
fully embodying that, right?

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.356 align:middle line:90%
Because it's that dissociation.

00:10:08.356 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
an attempt.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those things where

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
we have to stay really
positive, because it can just

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:90%
be so overwhelming.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You're like chem
trails, GMOs, argh.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And you just start
to kind of freak out.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Even the noise from
the news, for example, fear,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and bad news, and propaganda.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What are the
major, would you say,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle line:84%
low vibrational things that
affect us on a daily basis that

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:84%
you'd point to and say, these
are things you should be aware

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.165 align:middle line:84%
of and conscious of
and try to cut out?

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Well, I would
start with one at a time,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
because the list will just
kind of be overwhelming.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But GMO foods, all the
pesticides, the air quality,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:90%
and the chem trails, the water.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a hacking
of every type of element

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that we interact with
has been compromised,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
even like Wi-Fi and
cell phone towers.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like, wow,
there's a bombardment of a lot.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's like,
OK, one thing at a time,

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
how can I just
switch to organic?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:90%
How can I just filter my water?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Go buy spring water.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, those kinds of things.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Do you think that
ultimately this agenda comes

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
from a higher source than
just the human agenda?

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: There's an
ET agenda behind it.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I do feel like
there's an ET agenda,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.645 align:middle line:90%
and there's the other ET agenda.

00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Which is?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Which is the
positive agenda of helping

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Earth awaken, and what
we're doing here and what

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it's, I think,
key to keep those

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
on the same page,
because somehow

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
like the negative
orientation gets more press,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
gets more energy, and that
feeds all of the problems.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And so keeping up with
the idea and truly

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:84%
tuning into the
feeling that there's

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the benevolent
side just as much,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that has even more power
that's assisting us right now.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And so the
ultimate agenda,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
let's say the dark
side, would be what?

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Using these toxins to ultimately
make us more service to self?

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Or what is their
purpose in this?

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
To make us freak out, to make
us angry, to make us fearful,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.626 align:middle line:84%
to make us forget,
and maybe even orient.

00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what it's actually
doing to our genetics?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Like GMOs, right?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's
making us sick,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and the transgenesis and
all that is not good.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We can see that, the
negative effects.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But what is it doing
to the genetics that

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.066 align:middle line:84%
has the potential for
enlightenment or for good?

00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And we don't quite
know that yet.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it probably
is scarier than we think,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
but that's why at least just
moving towards the positive

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.966 align:middle line:90%
is going to be helpful.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And even going down
to the level of the way that

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
animals are killed
and consumed, I mean,

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
how does that
affect our biology,?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Basically, the way that--

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.718 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of the
older religions talk

00:12:47.718 --> 00:12:51.101 align:middle line:84%
about kosher and halal
foods, for example,

00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:84%
goes down to the way
even that the animals

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
are treated, humanely
and basically killed

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
with an offering.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Native American cultures,
is a prime example,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
where people see paying honor
and thanks to the animal,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
even praying over your food,
how that can essentially

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.472 align:middle line:84%
change the nature of
what you're consuming.

00:13:08.472 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
adrenaline, the fear.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what is then
encapsulated into the meat

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
that then we would be consuming.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's intense.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
eating adrenaline.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.796 align:middle line:84%
So what's that going
to do to your energy?

00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It's going to put you in
this like fight or flight,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
make you angry, heated,
those kinds of energies.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:90%
So I agree with you.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.072 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
calm the animal--

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I've had friends
that have done this,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and like fully
calmed the animal--

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:90%
the blood pressure goes down.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything is calmed.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And that experience would be
far different of a vibration.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the animal,
the way that we can treat it,

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.024 align:middle line:90%
like you're saying.

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And then in terms of
prayer, for example, I mean,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that's an ancient practice
of praying over food.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And even down to the
scientific experiments about

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
how plants listen, right?

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:90%
You can talk to plants.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.928 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reaction.

00:13:56.928 --> 00:14:01.435 align:middle line:84%
We know that water reacts
to the vibration of words.

00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that
we can actually

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
reprogram our food to
basically benefit us more,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.129 align:middle line:84%
to be more nutritious,
and raise our vibration?

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:09.086 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:14:09.086 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, presence
would be key, right?

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.839 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
fast paced culture

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
where it's just like grabbing
something on the go and moving.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I just heard that in Japan
if you're walking and eating

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, it's
kind of bad, bad posture,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's that sitting
with it and that presence.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And just that
conscious attention

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
is, one, making it
easier to digest.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It's making everything
move, salivation.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:90%
But also, it's the honoring.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that
looks like for you.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And definitely putting
our energy into it.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And making your own food,
growing your own food,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of things really
add to the vibrational quality

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:90%
and the interaction.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Even the genetics, like if
your sweat or your certain--

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
like even if your
urine is with the soil,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
then the plants grow for
you and have what you need.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.605 align:middle line:90%
So there's an interaction.

00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
disconnection is

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
what we've lost if we just
go to the grocery store

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and we grab something,
or we just eat something.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really coming back
into connection with our food

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and with nature itself.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.431 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned earlier
about chem trails.

00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:14.232 align:middle line:84%
What is it, A, that
you think they're

00:15:14.232 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
doing with these chem trails?

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to be heavy
metals that they're releasing.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what is
the purpose of that?

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Oh, brain fog,
major toxification of the body.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there is an
association between aluminum

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:90%
toxicity and Alzheimer's.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it can go in a
lot of different directions.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:90%
But definitely to dim us.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really important
to be consciously aware of it

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and work with it.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And how do we annul
or cancel out that chem trail

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:90%
toxin?

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, I
mean, on big chem days,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.229 align:middle line:90%
like to not be in it.

00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those
things to kind of be--

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think of it
like the weather report,

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.124 align:middle line:84%
where it's like it's
a chemy day, you know?

00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
OK, well, I'm not

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
going to go out if it's
raining or something like that.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So just not participating
with it, and be aware of that.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But definitely just detoxifying,
whether that's through

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
like cilantro and
parsley, like those kinds

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that draw heavy metals
out of the body.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Chlorella, spirulina.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of things.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And then definitely
respiratory support,

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
because it gets
the lungs, right?

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So cordyceps mushrooms
and eucalyptus

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
essential oils to keep the
respiratory system really

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
healthy and vibrant, and
keep the immune system going.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned, obviously,
about GMOs and the potential

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.045 align:middle line:84%
to rearrange our genetics
going forth into the future.

00:16:35.045 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
There have been
studies that seem

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.586 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that like, for
example, like salamanders

00:16:38.586 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and frogs actually change
sex based on certain GMOs.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So what do you make is the
most harmful aspect of it?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: The most harmful?

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.638 align:middle line:84%
The most harmful, we
probably don't know.

00:16:50.638 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
probably infertility.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what if we can't
reproduce like as a species?

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that would probably
be the foremost consideration.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
everything else,

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
because when we are reproducing,
if there's liver failure

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
or gastrointestinal disorders,
the different things that

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
come from the GMOs,
like if that's

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
passed onto the
children, I mean,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
what is that going to do
just a few generations later?

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So I really think it's
about the foresight

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:90%
and looking at what it's doing.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that the
fertility is probably

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
the scariest thing.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Let's talk
about detox then.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we've talked
about a lot of the toxins.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.773 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a little
bit about detox.

00:17:30.773 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But how do we basically go
about detoxing our system

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and living in basically a
detoxification lifestyle

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.675 align:middle line:84%
to deal with all these
balloons we're dealing with?

00:17:40.675 --> 00:17:42.216 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah,
first and foremost,

00:17:42.216 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
it would be to relax and to
be in like a meditative state.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if we act through
cleansing or detoxing

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.604 align:middle line:84%
or implementing these positive
solutions through fear,

00:17:53.604 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to do much,
because like our cortisol

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.853 align:middle line:90%
and adrenaline is rushing.

00:17:56.853 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we're just
kind of psychotic.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And our body is not going to
be able to relax enough to do

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
what it needs to do.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.476 align:middle line:84%
So I think taking that
present state around it

00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:90%
is the first impression to do.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
So that would be first.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
sweating, especially

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
like near-infrared sweating, to
detoxify like on a deep level,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
going deep into the body
and releasing toxins

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
through the sweat is
probably the easiest way.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Liver cleansing, because
so many of the heavy metals

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and the toxins, and even the
bad estrogens, those kinds

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of things, sit in the liver.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of green stuff
is going to help with that.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And really, anything
like bentonite clays

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and drying substances,
like charcoal,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.061 align:middle line:84%
to pull those heavy
metals out of the body's

00:18:41.061 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:90%
going to be really good.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
How do we go about listening
to our body's cravings

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and actually understanding
that, as you say,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:84%
consider your surroundings
before listening to your body's

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:90%
cravings?

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's one of those things
where our guts especially--

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
we're a very actually parasitic
and bacterial-run culture,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
which I said determines
our thoughts.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And so actually reseeding
the gut with good bacteria.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's refermented
foods, probiotics,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of things,
so that we can actually

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:90%
listen to ourselves.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And through this
detoxification process,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
go, OK, what's really me
asking for this chocolate cake?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Or what is really me asking
for this certain thing?

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:90%
And what do I really need?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
So getting that orientation.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that even cultural
or location can influence

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
like what you feel like
eating, because we are

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:90%
an empathic collective mind.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And so being aware
of that is like.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, is this my
thought craving this burger?

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Or is it someone else's?

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of being aware of
what's you and what's another.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So is that what you
mean by the programmed dietary

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:90%
imprint?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's that basically it's being
programmed by our surroundings.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's very influential.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.852 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: As far as the--

00:19:55.852 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
there's like a sort
of popular thing now.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about how popular.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But like people are talking
about this breatharianism,

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Right.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: As basically somebody
who is living on ideally light

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.738 align:middle line:84%
Although, I know
some of these guys

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
feel like-- eat like a Big
Mac once a week or something.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they just don't eat
at all for the next 10 days

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.128 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So there's different
approaches to breatharianism.

00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that
this idea of moving us

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
towards being breatharians,
being able to just live off

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
light, not having
to consume food,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.512 align:middle line:84%
is this where the starseeds
are moving us towards?

00:20:26.512 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Absolutely.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's going to be--

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
we're going to need to do a
lot of things to get there,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's the return
to the realization

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are free energy
devices ourselves.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So we can create and
pull chi from the heavens

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.229 align:middle line:84%
from all around us and
live off of that vitality.

00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
places like nature

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can breathe in like the
mana, the life force around us,

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
we really can fuel
ourselves through that.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
refined form of fuel.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, external,
we use food right now.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.742 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just transitioning
to these higher forms of energy

00:21:04.742 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that we
can create our own.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like that's
what's happening

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:90%
with the breatharianism.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm like a plant.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I can take in
energy from the sun.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a great practice.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll
move towards it.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
to be aware of.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Is this, ultimately,
what you think that your work

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.742 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately teaching us about,
becoming more in tune with

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:90%
the universe around us?

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does that
basically describe

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing here?

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's really initiating
and bridging

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
the higher perspectives,
whether it's galactic or just

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
frequencies and
being aware of nature

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of things,
and bringing it back

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and orienting us to our natural
selves so that in everyday life

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.042 align:middle line:84%
we can live as better people
and truly change the world.

00:21:46.042 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's the bridging
of those two worlds,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
like the higher realm and
then the physical practicality

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.164 align:middle line:84%
of how to go about that
and to be a good person.

00:21:53.164 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, as you
discussed earlier,

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of us recall or have
inclinations to be in higher

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
density forms that weren't
necessarily as physical.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.244 align:middle line:84%
And it's a certain
journey balancing

00:22:05.244 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:90%
that has to be taking place.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.472 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to be
in this physical realm.

00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's more
challenges that come with it.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
suffering and stresses.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you particularly
recall, I was curious,

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
like any of these other
worlds that you've

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:90%
inhabited in past lives?

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: I do.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Particularly, Pleiadian.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And we can just say these
different names and such,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
but I've had full body
and full visual recall

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of these places that
I've been before and contact.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's cool is
that these lives, whether it's

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
a past life on Earth or some
of these lives in the stars,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
is they're aware of
us simultaneously.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this thing
that was 1,000 years ago

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:90%
or a million years ago.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:90%
They are aware of us now.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're assisting us
now, even though we are them

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: And so
that's very empowering.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like
this fantasy though.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's real right now,
and we can tap into it

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.797 align:middle line:90%
like that aspect of ourselves.

00:23:03.797 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But what is
so important about now.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
you were talking

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:84%
about the starseeds coming
here and this sort of waves

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:90%
of indigos and whatnot.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that is important
about the now in terms

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of remembering and tapping into
this intergalactic community?

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the whole 2012 idea
and the cycle of 26,000 years,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
this is like a resurgence
of Earth's possibility

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to fully awaken, to fully
remember, and kind of end

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
our programming of enslavement
genetically and energetically,

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and remember that we are coming
from these higher realms,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.149 align:middle line:84%
and that we have full capacity
to be empowered on Earth

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and do what we came here to do.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So right now is very
important because we

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
have everything that we need.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.493 align:middle line:84%
And now we just
need to act on it.

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Well, I'm curious.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is the reason
that the dark side has gotten--

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
was able to get so powerful
for the last few thousand years

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of taking
us into materiality

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and using the genetic coding and
the brainwashing that's taking

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:90%
place and detoxification?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
What allowed that empowerment
from them on their side?

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: I would say,
one, our forgetfulness,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
but I also feel like it's
a part of kind of the plan.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's been
helpful, because sometimes we

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
need to be pushed and
kind of to rock bottom

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
so that we can feel that
pressure to fully come

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:90%
into our full power.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like it's been
nothing but helpful, and maybe

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:90%
in a way orchestrated that way.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, that's
the whole point.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
If you are pushed to the brink--

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the universe always--

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:90%
how do you say?

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's regulatory.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It balances itself out.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.043 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So it's like
if it doesn't survive,

00:24:40.043 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
something new is born
from that destruction.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's a trauma,
something collapses,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
we build something
new in its place.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant
rebirthing cycle.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.730 align:middle line:84%
For you in your work, I
mean, what would you say?

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.854 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you said
earlier that you felt

00:24:55.854 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:90%
like you were drawn to this.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You knew that you
had memories and you

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:84%
knew that essentially
this was your mission.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But how would you
define your mission?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, my mission is
to initiate people into that.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not even hope.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Like hope's not a good word.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But really motivating
them into full remembrance

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and awakening and feeling that,
and being excited about life

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and excited about what
they're meant to do here.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So reinvigorating that
energy, because I think that's

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
been lost.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It's been-- you know,
it's hard life for people.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:90%
And it it's a challenging time.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Exactly.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: But to bring
back fun and play and passion

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and vigor, like those
kinds of energies,

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:84%
into this transformational
process I think is really key.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Exactly.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.322 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, going
back to the embodiment,

00:25:43.322 --> 00:25:44.863 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk more
about the organs.

00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier about
how the organs have always

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:84%
been related to certain
planets and certain plants

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that the
organs themselves have

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:90%
been reprogrammed in any way?

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, like whether it's
the-- you mentioned the gut has

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes been toxified.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.894 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's toxic, we
can't get in touch with it

00:26:03.894 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:90%
with our gut instinct.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yes!

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.555 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: The liver, obviously,
it's our life force.

00:26:07.555 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Our energy force is there.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And so alcohol and other things,
sugars, are toxifying it.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So what would you say had been
like the most, A, reprogrammed?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But also sort of
which organs are

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
under the most stress of this
sort of agenda of control?

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah, I would
say, number one, I guess--

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:90%
yeah, the stomach's an organ.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
But I would say number one would
be the stomach and the gut.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind of
been the most compromised,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
especially with antibiotics
that are in non-organic meats

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and dairies, and that
we're taking vaccines.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Of course.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: Like
all of those things.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So the gut has really
been compromised

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:84%
in that bacteria
and that instinct,

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
as you were talking about, which
is the seat of our immunity

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an intelligence that
wants to communicate with us,

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as keep us
healthy and vital.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I would say probably
that's number one.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.815 align:middle line:84%
And then the liver with all
of the different estrogens

00:27:01.815 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and the different hormones that
we're being introduced with it.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We're having to try and
rebalance in our liver, as well

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:90%
as then all the heavy metals.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So I would say those two
have been really compromised.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And also the kidneys because
of our fast-paced life.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And like the chugging the
coffee, and the adrenaline

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
starts going, the
adrenals and the cortisol.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the lifestyle
that then pulls the lifeforce

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.242 align:middle line:90%
from the kidneys.

00:27:25.242 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And generations
down the road, they

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have that deep,
rich, sourceful energy

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
if we run out of
it, because we pass

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
on our kidney essence,
our kidney gene

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.635 align:middle line:90%
to the next generation.

00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Interesting.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NIELSEN: So it's kind of
bringing in a holistic view

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
of what we're doing
on all levels,

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and then also being prepared
to assist our future kids

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy way.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.313 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:90%
No, that's fascinating.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.576 align:middle line:84%
And again, it goes back
to this whole thing.

00:27:52.576 --> 00:27:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Like, you are what you eat.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.116 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's like we don't
realize that our food also

00:27:56.116 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:84%
can reprogram our DNA,
as I understand it.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.400 align:middle line:84%
People don't even
think about that.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it absolutely can.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have epigenetics.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we have
a disposition that

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
can be activated and
awakened, whether that's

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
through exercise, whether
that's through being

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
in certain places,
eating certain things.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:10%
And so I feel like
it's really empowering,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:10%
where we can like awaken these
latent parts of ourselves.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It's special.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.227 align:middle line:90%
And food can do that.

00:28:22.227 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
It does create
moods, as we know.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Certain foods create
certain emotional responses.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And others are more
deadening and lifeless.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NIELSEN: Definitely.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, Bridget, thank
you so much for joining me
