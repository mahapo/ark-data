>>SEAN STONE: Have we
discovered the forbidden fruit?

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.583 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:08.908 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:17.805 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.065 align:middle line:10%
is Dennis McKenna, who has
a PhD in botanical sciences

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
from the University
of British Columbia.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
His scientific research has
focused on ethnopharmacology

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
He has authored numerous
scientific articles and books,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
including co-author
of "The Invisible

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Landscape" with his
brother, Terence McKenna.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:10%
His most recent book is
called "The Brotherhood

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:10%
of the Screaming Abyss," where
he chronicles his exploration

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:10%
into the psychedelic world
with his brother Terence.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Today, he takes us
on our own journey

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to discover the
food of the gods.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So with that, I will
begin by asking you,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
are mushrooms storied
legendary food of the gods,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.084 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNIS MCKENNA:
Well, thank you, Sean,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:10%
for inviting me
to be on the show.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Are mushrooms the
food of the gods?

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.575 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
recognize that it's a myth.

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But to address the
possible truth of it,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
human species has

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
had a very long
relationship with mushrooms.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
They evolved in
the same ecologies.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, people would
have discovered them

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and had the experiences
that they make possible.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think they really
did play a role in what you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
might call cognitive evolution.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
In a certain way, they
taught our species

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
how to use language in a very
fundamental way, because they

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
created a world where symbols,
images, and sounds were

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They brought meaning into
the cognitive sphere.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, they
were the food of the gods.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They were also the
forbidden fruit,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in a certain sense, because they
brought knowledge to a species.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
was their role.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can
make a pretty good case

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that that was going on,
granting certain assumptions.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that aside from
people picking up mushrooms

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and randomly trying them,
eating them, hallucinating,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
there actually were
entire religions based

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
around use of the mushroom,
or at least mushroom

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
as an initiatory practice
within a religious--

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
that came later.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I think the discovery of the
mushrooms, which was initially

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
probably accidental-- you've
got a situation where you've

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
got essentially hungry
primates scanning

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
the environment for anything
that might be edible.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.835 align:middle line:84%
And these mushrooms
are in the tropics.

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Psilocybe cubensis, the
pantropical magic mushroom,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin mushroom, is not
shy about being noticed.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a very spectacular,
large-looking mushroom.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know, they
would notice it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And being hungry or just
simply being curious,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
they would consume it, and
that would make the connection,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, to this unseen realm
that they would discover there.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And religion, and
to a certain extent,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
shamanism were
artifacts, inventions

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that we had to create
in order to deal

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:90%
with this alternate reality.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
way to think of it.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
The religions came later.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics are not
religions in themselves,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
but they activate
religious sensibilities.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can now
actually correlate that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to neuroanatomy and
neurophysiology.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
There are studies now under way
where the mystical experience,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
so-called mystical experience
can be reliably induced

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
by psilocybin and
other psychedelics.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
But psilocybin is
ideally for studying

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:90%
this in the scientific context.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So mystical experiences
used to be something

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that people would strive for,
hope for, and spend years

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
meditating and self-flagellating
or whatever, in the hopes

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that they might at
some point be blessed

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%
with a mystical experience.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
We can now reliably induce
a mystical experience

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in 20 milligrams of psilocybin
in the right circumstances.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Any schmuck can have
a mystical experience.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be a saint.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It might make you a saint.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's an interesting
point, because many people

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
would argue that there's
a particular break, a very

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
demarcated break between
the present religions that

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
are very much anti-drug and
the ancient realm, the pagan

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
realm, which seemed to have
utilized mystical experiences

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelic experiences.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
modern religions actually

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
were predicated in
initial drug use

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.629 align:middle line:84%
to have the visions of
the prophets of the past,

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and then the modern religions
basically came and clamped down

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to make sure no one else
could access the gods,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.714 align:middle line:84%
and basically had to
create a control structure?

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You took the
words right out of my mouth.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
I think happened.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that the roots
of these religions

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
was based in
psychedelic experience

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and actual personal
experience and ecstasy.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And as they evolved into
structured institutions

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
based on dogma and ritual and
all that, the spiritual power,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the numinosity was
even eviscerated out

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:90%
of those religions.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
They are now hollow
shells, in a certain way.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not about bringing
people closer to God anymore.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They're about getting people
to accept a set of beliefs

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:90%
that may or may not be true.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they look
at them closely,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot to be questioned
about these dogmatic precepts.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So religions have
evolved or devolved,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps a better word, into
institutions for controlling

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:90%
people's behavior.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Like so many institutions, it's
all about controlling people's

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The last thing they want
their adherents to have

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:90%
is a mystical experience.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Real, genuine
mystical experiences

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:84%
are dangerous to the
established power structures.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because do you think
that the mystical experiences

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
actually help promote
and perpetuate peace

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:90%
within a society?

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, they help pro--

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
yeah, they help promote peace.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
They help promote different
ways of relating to each other.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They help people to think
for themselves, essentially.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
They help people-- you know,
you don't have to be a priest.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be an even
particularly good person

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to have a psychedelic
experience that,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
by all intents and purposes,
is a mystical experience.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And religions, like
most institutions,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
they want to take that power
away from the individual.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, only the
priests get to have--

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
talk directly to God, if
you want to put it that way.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you what you're
supposed to think about this.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to go talk to God.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, these
mystical experiences

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelics
as general, they're

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:90%
dangerous in that sense.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Not that the drugs are
particularly dangerous.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The drugs are remarkably
safe in the physiological,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
toxicological sense, as
long as certain common sense

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:90%
guidelines are followed.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They're dangerous because
they give you dangerous ideas.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Like back in the '60s, we
saw this, the influence

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:90%
that LSD was having on society.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And people were thinking, now,
why should I go to Vietnam

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and kill somebody I don't know
just because my government

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.655 align:middle line:90%
tells me to?

00:08:18.655 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So it encourages
self-responsibility,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:90%
and individual thought.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
This is not convenient
for power structures.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.540 align:middle line:84%
They want people to be nice,
consumer, obedient consumer

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
robots.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So would you
recommend any number

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.339 align:middle line:84%
of these hallucinogenics
from LSD to ayahuasca

00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
to mushrooms, peyote?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.434 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically recommend
anything to anyone?

00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Or would you say
that these should

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
be done within a context of
more of a religious experience,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.004 align:middle line:90%
under certain guidance?

00:08:54.004 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I certainly
wouldn't recommend them

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
to anyone.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they need to be
used in a context that's

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Ever since the '60s,
the earliest people,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Leary and those people,
emphasized the importance

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of set and setting.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Setting being the setting.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Needs to be appropriate.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the set is
what you bring to it,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
everything you might be,
but also preparation.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
They should be approached
very thoughtfully.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
These are powerful experiences,
life-transforming experiences,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:90%
The outcomes can be fantastic.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
People have said, for
example, of ayahuasca,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
one ayahuasca session is
like 10 years of therapy.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
would go that far,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
but definitely, these things can
open up the mind and the heart

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and allow for insights and
real therapeutic changes

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that talk therapy takes
much longer to get there,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and pharmacotherapy, as it's
practiced by the psychiatric

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and the conventional psychiatry
doesn't really address at all.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, most of the panoply
of psychopharmaceuticals

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
are either ineffective
or barely effective

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or effective in a much
smaller group of people

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:90%
than they're prescribed to.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if we want to get
off onto that tangent, which

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
we may, I think
psychiatry, you know,

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
relies far too much
on those things,

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and we need to find some way
to reintegrate psychedelics

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:90%
into psychiatry.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We know now that opioids
are killing more Americans

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:90%
than cars or drugs, right?

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
alternative paths

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.415 align:middle line:84%
for people to take
as far as drugs

00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about, for example,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:84%
that are not pharmaceutical
to prescribe drugs?

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, you mean
for that kind of therapy?

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: For depression,
you know, like,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
people dealing with depression
issues, for example.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: These psychedelics,
under the right circumstances,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
can be used to treat
and actually resolve--

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
cure, if you want
to use that term--

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
a number of things, ranging
from intractable depression

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
to addictions to post-traumatic
stress, and even other things

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that you might not expect like
cluster headaches, for example,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So there is a range of
things that psychedelics

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
can be used to treat and cure.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
prevalent in our society,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
because I think, you
know, these medicines,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
these psychedelics are
medicines of the spirit,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They treat spiritual
dysfunctions.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And as a culture, we're wounded.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
We are spiritually wounded.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not surprising that
the individuals in that culture

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:90%
are also spiritually wounded.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And people feel, I believe, that
their spiritual institutions

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:90%
are not supporting them.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:90%
They may go to church on Sunday.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps some get a
spiritual satisfaction.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel like spiritual
institutions are hollowed out.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
address their needs,

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're so
spiritually bereft,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
this is why they
might be motivated

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to go to South America or go
someplace and take ayahuasca.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
These are not drug-crazed
hippies looking for a thrill.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
These are usually
fairly thoughtful people

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:84%
who want a really personally
meaningful experience.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelics can
provide that to them

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:90%
under the right circumstances.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.453 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: But that said, not
everyone should take them.

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are people,
schizophrenics primarily,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
other people who probably
shouldn't take psychedelics

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
if they have a genetic
proclivity for psychosis

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
There are other techniques that
can approach the same thing

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
like holotropic breathwork,
and those people

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
should look at
those alternative.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
question, for example,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:90%
from one of our audience.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Danielle from Canada asks,
what kind of compounds,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:10%
if there are any
compounds, that you

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.916 align:middle line:10%
can use that will take you to
hyperspace without affecting

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.880 align:middle line:10%
your mental clarity?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.745 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: I was kind of amused
by that question, actually.

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.716 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.716 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to say to that.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
go into hyperspace,

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
your mental clarity is
going to be effective.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.779 align:middle line:90%
There's no way around it.

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I think
certain people have--

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I guess there are
different degrees of,

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
for example, I know
if you smoke DMT,

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of a
20-minute journey,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you pretty much
come back, and you're in one.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.202 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with LSD, for example,
I think people can drop acid

00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and still function,
and that can actually

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:90%
be very detrimental to your--

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
to actually hurting
yourself if you actually

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.589 align:middle line:90%
try to function on LSD.

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you do
something like ayahuasca,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty much
lying down, resting.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to be able to move.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.409 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: This is just this
issue of set and setting.

00:13:57.409 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The important
thing to emphasize

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
is that the set and the
setting is important.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The setting should be
a place that you don't

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
have any responsibilities.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
You can focus on the experience.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the essence of
the psychedelic experience

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
is something that happens
between you and the medicine.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, we talk of the
shaman or the curandero

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
or the therapist as the
teacher or whatever.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
But really, it's not.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:90%
The medicine is the teacher.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's the encounter
between the person

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and the medicine in that
very intense personal space

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:90%
that the therapeutics goes on.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
A good therapist
or a good shaman

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
will have the wisdom and
the experience to know--

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:90%
to step back from that.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They are just there to
facilitate the encounter.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And if the person gets into
a state of high anxiety

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or needs reassurance
or something,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
they're there to help with that.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not there to
control the session.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, many times, they
will take that role,

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
but you're not with the right
therapist, in my opinion.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They have to have confidence
and trust enough in the medicine

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to let the medicine do its work.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, psychedelics
are like something

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
that no one can do
it for you, you know?

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
No one can be born for you or
die for you or have sex for you

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
or do any of these
personally meaningful things.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Psychedelic
is like that.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: It's your journey.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's your journey.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.972 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But towards
this notion of--

00:15:41.972 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about very
extreme psychedelics, right?

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.385 align:middle line:84%
These are like ayahuasca and
LSD and mushroom experiences.

00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:90%
They're relatively extreme.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I'm hearing
about things now,

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
things like hemp
oil that you can

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
take, things like
microdosing of mushrooms

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that people use to try to
combat ADD, for example,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and help you focus.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this might
be the way of solving

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our issues
with opioid addiction

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
by going towards a microdose
of some of these hallucinogens?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well,
there are psychedelics

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that can be used
to treat addictions

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that are particularly
good for that,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:90%
ibogaine being one of the ones.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's particularly effective
for opiate addiction.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not a typical psychedelic
in terms of its pharmacology.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Most psychedelics work only
on serotonin receptors,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
pretty much primarily
on serotonin receptors.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Ibogaine works on a
variety of receptors.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
What it does that none
of the others do is

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it specifically interrupts
the cravings for opiates,

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
for a temporary period after--

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the usual process is that
people get a high-dose session

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:90%
with ibogaine.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
This is in no way recreational.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:84%
This is an ordeal, which may
last as long as 36 hours.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But the person will have
often a review of their life

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and where they
went wrong, and how

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:90%
they might find their way back.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of material to process.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But then for about
anywhere from a week

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to even a month or
even two, in what they

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
call the afterglow of
the ibogaine experience,

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
a person has no
cravings for opiates.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So their life does not revolve
around that for a while.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what
preparation they've

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
made for what happens
after the session,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:90%
it can be effective or not.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:84%
They have to realize
that after the session,

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
they have to change
where they live,

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
their friends, their habits,
everything so that they

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:90%
can take advantage of that.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Say, this is going
to change my life,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and I am ready to move
into this new life.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the idea of--

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's so easy to fall
back into the world of habits,

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.239 align:middle line:90%
of the same old--

00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, the idea of
psychedelics is not just that

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.196 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take
a psychedelic drug,

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:13.259 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to--

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:90%
your mind is going to be blown.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
You'll be transformed
and cleansed

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to go
about your life as before.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the idea is that it's
a spiritual journey we're on.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And these are--

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I would understand it as
these are sort of hints.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.096 align:middle line:84%
These are hints about
the spiritual landscape

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're really
in, and they're there

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:90%
to help guide us, right?

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned before
about the spiritual vacuity

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of America, this
idea that we are

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:90%
in this place of spiritual loss.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just curious as
to why you think that is.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You think that we're more
sick than other societies,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
or it's just every society
has this level of sickness?

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.372 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I think--

00:18:46.372 --> 00:18:47.172 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:47.972 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that globally,
we're spiritually bereft.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think in
the United States,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:84%
in the so-called
developed world,

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
we're perhaps more
spiritually bereft

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
than even in developing
countries for multiple reasons,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for one thing,
in developing countries,

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
the family structure
is different.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Now in our country, people are
separated from their families.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Families' traditions
are not as important.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, honestly,
it's hard for me

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
to discuss this without
bashing religion,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.490 align:middle line:84%
because I put a lot of that
at the feet of religion

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
truly, it's not about--

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:84%
any longer about fostering
people's spiritual development.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about regulating
their behavior

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and insisting they believe
on faith, you know?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
That they believe a set
of doctrines or dogma

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:84%
or pronouncements for which
there's very little evidence,

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and good reason to think
there is no evidence.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
insistence on that.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think a key difference
between psychedelics

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and religion is psychedelics
don't demand faith.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:90%
You do not have to have faith.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
better if you don't.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You can be a skeptic
as much as you want.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
What you have to
have is courage.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to have courage to
put your assumptions aside

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and accept the experience,
and take it in and process it

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
for whatever it means for
you, and evaluate that.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's either meaningful
personally or not.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You can get help with your
interpretation of that.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.615 align:middle line:84%
You can talk to people
like me or my brother.

00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't talk
to my brother anymore.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are many,
many people who

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
are ready to tell
you what it means.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But my main message
is only you know

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
what it means because of
this intense personal nature.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't need Terence
McKenna or Dennis McKenna

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to tell you what it means.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.014 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And that's the
opposite of religion, right?

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you individually
choose for yourself

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
what it means to you,
rather than listening

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to someone else's dogma, someone
else's teaching and saying, no.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You explore and experience
it for yourself.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's the
antidote to religion.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You know God
for yourself, right?

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a very personal
experience of God that religion

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:90%
normally doesn't teach.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But you talked about the '60s
and '70s and the exploration

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of LSD helping to combat
the militarism of the time

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.645 align:middle line:90%
with Vietnam.

00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But we've seen America become
reactionary in a certain sense.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we have
become an armed madhouse,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
despite the awakening
of the '60s and '70s?

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Or are there any--

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is there any evidence that
that awakening did actually

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
help to expand our
minds, our consciousness,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that it has done positive
gains for America?

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I think it
was a net positive thing.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But if it was an
awakening, it was aborted.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It crashed and burned,
because it was mostly

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
about LSD, which sort
of dropped like a bomb

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
into society, which was already
in turmoil at that point.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
We had no tradition.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We had no reference
point for LSD.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The ancient,
indigenous traditions

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:90%
were not known to most people.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the good
effects of the early '60s

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
was that these traditions
were rediscovered, you know?

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
But we had no way.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the people advocating
them and the people

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that were against
them didn't really

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
realize the sort of spiritual
and cultural potency

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
of something like LSD.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
What's changed now
is that we have

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
had 45 years or more to learn
how to use these things.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.784 align:middle line:84%
We've rediscovered the
indigenous traditions.

00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Because if you want to know
how to use these things,

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
talk to the people that have
used them for 10,000 years.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:90%
They know a thing or two.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
We can't whole-- you
know, wholly just

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:90%
co-opt these traditions.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
wrong approach.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:90%
But we can borrow from them.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
They can take and we
can build our own sort

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
of neo-shamanic, 20th century
context for using them.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten a lot smarter about
how to use them in a sense.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Also I think a
big thing that has

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
made a difference is it's not
about one substance anymore.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
There are many, and
many of them are plants.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was lacking
from the last one.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It was LSD or nothing.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people didn't even know
there were plants out there.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But now the phenomenon that you
see, mushrooms, which of course

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
is not a plant, but we'll
let it be a plant honorarily.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
But natural forces.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to have
huge infrastructures of labs

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and synthesis and distribution.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
The contemporary
psychedelic movement

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
is something that
happens in gardens.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:90%
People grow plants.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
They exchange them
across the back fence.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
They teach other people
how to grow them,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
how to prepare them,
how to use them.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much more organic
and less threatening

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
kind of spread of this
knowledge into the culture,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's associated with a
plant or more than one plant.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's
a symbiosis, right?

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
They call these things plant
teachers or plant allies.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is literally true.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.482 align:middle line:84%
That's a perfect
way to describe it.

00:24:30.482 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Don't you think
we should have everyone

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.731 align:middle line:84%
who serves in government,
who becomes a public servant,

00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
have to take some kind of plant
medicine upon entering office?

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Ideally, yes.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
If they would.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If they could be
persuaded to, I think

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
it would do them a lot of good.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.805 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, especially,
I was going to say, like,

00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:90%
with prison systems.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.994 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think that's one
aspect of reforming the prison

00:24:50.994 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:90%
system would be to help--

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The structured use
of something like ayahuasca

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
or MDMA or something
in a prison context

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
would be tremendously
useful, and is being done,

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's not being
done here. ayahuasca's

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
being used in Brazil
in prisons, you know,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:84%
because there are several
churches in Brazil that

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
use ayahuasca.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
here in the States,

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're the
only ones allowed

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to use ayahuasca legally.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But they have an
ethical framework,

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and part of their good
works is to help prisoners.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And they do go in, and they
use ayahuasca with prisoners,

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:90%
and they have good results.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.226 align:middle line:84%
You know, politicians,
many of them could benefit.

00:25:42.226 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the first
place, politicians

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
tend to be people who are
quite rigid in their worldview.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They're very much in the mindset
of, our minds are made up.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't confuse us with facts.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, don't upset what
we already know to be true,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:90%
or believe to be true.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:90%
So they're resistant to it.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing is, I think--

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think the
problem is that politics

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is a profession that tends
to attract sociopaths.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And my
curandero, the one I've

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
been working with the last few
years, extremely wise fellow.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, so
who don't you treat?

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Who won't you let
into your sessions?

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there are
two people, two kinds

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of people I can't help.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
One is schizophrenics and
the other is sociopaths.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, ayahuasca will
not help sociopaths,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
nor any psychedelic.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.115 align:middle line:84%
And this is
worrisome, because we

00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
would like to think that
our political leaders would

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
have this revelation,
and it would change them.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a sociopath,
your structures are too well--

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're not open
to actual personal change

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.630 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And
unfortunately, these are

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.827 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are controlling
the criminalization of drugs,

00:27:09.827 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
controlling the system that

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.619 align:middle line:84%
makes these drugs into
class I drugs, for example.

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any hope
that we're going

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to see these drugs, these
hallucinogens basically taken

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
off of the schedule
of being criminal--

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
considered criminal drugs,
and being utilized as,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, by doctors, by
alternative psychiatrists

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot?

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I think that is going to happen.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It is already happening.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the timeframe is.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's more research
now on psychedelics

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
than there's been in
the last 40 years.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Good, solid research.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.115 align:middle line:84%
Very, very tightly controlled
clinical studies, and all that.

00:27:49.115 --> 00:27:54.140 align:middle line:84%
In the 45 years that's passed or
so since these drugs were kind

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of banned in a blanket
sense, you know,

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:90%
we've gotten better science.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We know how to design
better clinical studies that

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:90%
are more evaluative.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And so slowly,
slowly, the data--

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and even not so
slowly now-- that data

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is accumulating that
these substances can

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:90%
be used therapeutically.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:90%
For example, MDMA for trauma.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And trauma, post-traumatic
stress syndrome,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is so prevalent.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
huge national need

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:84%
for that associated with
the veterans, and so on.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:10%
So MAPS, one of
the organizations

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:10%
that's doing this research,
has focused on MDMA.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They just got FDA
approval for what's

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:90%
called a Phase III trial.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
That's many thousands of
subjects, multiple centers.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the final phase
in a clinical study

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
before the drug can be approved
as a prescription medicine.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And they are there now.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:90%
They've got that approval.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But then that's also the
most expensive, the longest.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It takes millions of dollars.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But they've gotten
to this point.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:90%
That's because the data is good.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Same with psilocybin.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
The nonprofit that
I'm affiliated with,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Heffter Research
Institute, which

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:84%
just gets much less
attention than MAPS,

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
but also does very
effective work,

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and we've focused
some psilocybin.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're bringing in psilocybin
to kind of the same place.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the areas where our
research has pointed to

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.770 align:middle line:84%
is the use of psilocybin
to relieve anxiety,

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and existential anxiety
in the terminally

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:84%
ill to help them come
to terms with the fact

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that they're dying, and actually
to use the power of psilocybin

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to reliably induce these
mystical experiences.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think psilocybin
is going to be accepted

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
for various things in
medicine, but initially

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:84%
probably for the use in the
hospice situations, you know?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Because that is-- it's easier
to fast track a drug like that,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:84%
because you're giving
it to dying people.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And psilocybin happens to be
quite nontoxic and compatible

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
with human metabolism,
so you can give it

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to people who are ill
without danger, you know?

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
again, coming back

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to this sort of spiritual
bereftness of our culture,

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.600 align:middle line:84%
medicine is also
spiritually bereft.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Medicine has exorcised
spirit out of itself,

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and since about 150 years ago.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The model is, we're
just machines.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Apply the right
molecular monkey wrench,

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and you can fix the machine.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is a component
of human existence,

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's why reintroduction
of these psychedelics

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:90%
into medicine is so important.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Because in order
to do that, you've

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
got to reintroduce
spirit into medicine,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
acknowledge, there

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
is no separation
between spirit or mind,

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that, and body.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a holistic system.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
If you treat the
disorders of the mind,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
you can treat the disorders
of the body, and vice versa.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why something
like ayahuasca's

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
so often used
effectively for what we

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:90%
think of as physical illnesses.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.221 align:middle line:10%
But again, that gets
back to the idea

00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:10%
of the individual, the personal,
subjective experience, which

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:10%
is all in the face of the idea
of mechanistic, repetitive

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:10%
science that can be
applied to anybody.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to appreciate
the universe that--

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the individual personality is
not a universal personality.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.455 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: This
is only something

00:31:42.455 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:10%
that can be done with the
individual in especially

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.340 align:middle line:10%
tailored situations.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why you've got to
use psychedelics effectively

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:90%
in medicine.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
This is never going to be
about, take two and call me

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
This is about--
the therapist has

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to be totally focused,
intensely involved

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
with the person over
a period of time,

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:84%
whether that therapist is a
traditional psychotherapist

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or a curandero, or some
combination of the two.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
where psychiatry is

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
going to evolve if these
substances are ever

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:90%
accepted into medicine.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:23.100 align:middle line:84%
20 years from now,
the psychiatry

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to look a
lot like shamanism.

>>SEAN: I really
appreciate your time today.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

>>MCKENNA: Thank you.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure, Sean.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Thank you.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.482 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:32:35.482 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Dennis McKenna.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
today, so I urge you to check
out his website, heffter.org.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It requires constant
reassessment.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.122 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:32:54.122 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.
