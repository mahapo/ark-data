00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
Jay Dyer joins me today.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:10%
His focus is on the interplay
of film, geopolitics, espionage,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:10%
and psychological warfare.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%
Jay is a lecturer and author
of the popular book, "Esoteric

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:10%
Hollywood: Sex, Cults,
and Symbols in Film,"

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:10%
as well as the host of the
"Jay's Analysis" podcast.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Jay's also a regular contributor
to "21st Century Wire," "Soul

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
of the East," and the
"Espionage History Archive."

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Today we'll be discussing
the American urge for war

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and how they sell it
to us through media,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and what the Illuminati
really wants.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by
asking, Jay, based

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
on your experience,
obviously years

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of researching and watching
a lot of films, analyzing,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
is the ultimate--

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.289 align:middle line:84%
I would say-- the ultimate
agenda that's being promoted

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to making movies?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there an agenda, even, let's
say, to what gets greenlit?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Are directors told, this is
what you're going to make?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Or do you think that there
is maybe something more,

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.057 align:middle line:84%
would you say, like a
zeitgeist in the air?

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I think you have to go back
to the beginning of the camera,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:10%
its invention, and the fact that
it was known from the get-go,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:10%
even with Thomas Edison, that
you could use this object

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:10%
for propaganda.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And so even in
the earliest days,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
people were freaked out by
like a train coming, right?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They'd never seen a thing
like that, with a film.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then if you move up
into the World War I era,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
it was already being used
for propaganda, films were.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And then think of, say,
Howard Hughes, right?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
He filmed war
propaganda footage.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.919 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest film of its time
in 1930 was "Hell's Angels."

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and "Hell's Angels" was
all about war propaganda.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.912 align:middle line:84%
So from the outset of
Hollywood, I think the Pentagon

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
military strategists,
they realized

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that this entity could
be used to shape and mold

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:90%
people's worldviews.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
And so if you not just
consider Hollywood, but also,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the rise
of, say, CBS and all that,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the people who were the founders
of that came out of the OSS,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
which is the Office
of Strategic Services,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
founded in 1942, sort of
the precursor to the CIA.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So William Paley,
David Sarnoff-- these

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
are all people who
come out of that world,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
as well as people from the
advertising and marketing

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
If you look at RKO Pictures,
as well, the Rockefellers

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
had a tremendous influence
and control of that.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Joe Kennedy, Sr., was one of the
heads of RKO for a long time.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's always been
this tremendous influence,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
this background of
shadow power, that I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
think has had the say-so,
ultimately, in what

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
would get made, mainly in
terms of the big blockbuster,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
big-scale stuff.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot of
people who do make good message

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.099 align:middle line:90%
films that are out there.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to the big things--

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.306 align:middle line:84%
like you're talking
about war and things

00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
like this-- absolutely,
the blockbusters

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
tailored and engineered

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.109 align:middle line:90%
to sell the Pentagon's agenda.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
have actually been

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of scholarly
works written on this.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
There's "Operation
Hollywood," which

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.642 align:middle line:84%
is a collection
of academics that

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:84%
have written on the influence
of the Pentagon and war films

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, pushing their
foreign policy agenda.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
There's Patricia Jenkins'
book, "CIA in Hollywood."

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:90%
And then there's also my book.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have
been writing on that topic

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, look,
actually, these movies

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.217 align:middle line:84%
are not just harmless
creative entertainment.

00:03:32.217 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
messaging that's been

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:90%
putting into these films.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, obviously,
when it comes

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to militarization
in Hollywood, you

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
could see "Zero Dark Thirty"
and the CIA management of that.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.146 align:middle line:90%
Or "Argo," for example.

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> "American Sniper."

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> "American Sniper I mean,
these are very obvious

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:90%
examples.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about the
esoteric agenda, you know,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
it strikes me-- I
watch movies often

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that have 33 very
prominently chosen

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:90%
as a number within the film.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, you
have all these numbers

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:90%
to choose from.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Why is it 33?

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Why is the all-seeing eye there?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.974 align:middle line:84%
And that just makes you
wonder, from your research,

00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
is it something
that, for example,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the production
designers, art designers,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
are perhaps just aware
of, and they're perhaps

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Freemasons or whatnot?

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Or is it actually
like, how do you say?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Even from the director and
the director's perspective,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
and even the producers or the
higher-ups, sort of saying,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
let's throw the
symbols in there?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.508 align:middle line:84%
I think you can go
all the way back

00:04:24.508 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
even to-- again, in the early
days, you look at Fritz Lang.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:10%
And he would use German
Expressionism, which

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:10%
utilized a lot of Surrealist
symbolism and was, actually,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:10%
many times influenced
by Satanism.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
You can find that
in Fritz Lang films.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And then even in
early Hitchcock films,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
you'll find references
to all-seeing eyes.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll find Masonic
symbolism and imagery.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And that continues
on into, obviously,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
into the '60s, when you have
a lot of sort of-- you know,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Anger, and more overt
Luciferian themes in his films.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And even though those were kind
of French, kind of out there--

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.826 align:middle line:84%
I think if you look at
David McGowan's book,

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
"Weird Scenes
Inside the Canyon,"

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
he's shown the connections
between the music

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
scene and its Satanic
and occultic influences,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and Hollywood out
in Mulholland Drive,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, if you've
been out that-- I'm sure

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:90%
you've been out that way.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the movie
"Mulholland Drive."

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.223 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say-- exactly.

00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:16.265 align:middle line:84%
And I just was in LA
about a month ago,

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never been
to Mulholland Drive.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we drove up
Wonderland Avenue,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.857 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the whole
facility, Lookout Mountain,

00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
where they used to shoot--
it was an old Air Force

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Base, where they used to
shoot war propaganda footage.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And you had people like Walt
Disney, Jimmy Stewart-- these

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
were the top A-listers
in the '40s and '50s

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that only had access
to that studio,

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
where they would film all
kinds of-- well, propaganda,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going
on for a long time.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, certainly
people have asked me about

00:05:43.418 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
my father's films,
obviously, things like why,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
in "Any Given Sunday," they have
the-- the Dallas Knights are

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:90%
the opposing, villain team.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
know, Dallas is where

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.983 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy was killed, right?

00:05:52.983 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the Dallas Knights
have the all-seeing eye

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
as one of their logos,
and also the Templar

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
cross on their
jerseys, for example.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, I don't know.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
For myself, it's like,
did my father study?

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Or did he simply--
was he intuiting,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.003 align:middle line:84%
based on things that he'd picked
up, part of that unconscious?

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And you see certain
symbols in his films,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's hard to know,
sometimes, whether or not

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
there's an esoteric aspect
to someone's unconscious mind

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
or subconscious brain
that's working, oftentimes,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:90%
through the artist.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But at what level do you
see the organized component,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the Masonic component,
that you would say

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.774 align:middle line:84%
is very prominent and clear in
Hollywood, from your research?

00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think if you look
at-- we mentioned "Mulholland

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Drive."

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
David Lynch's films,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I think he presents a consistent
pattern of, in a symbolic way,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:90%
telling how this happens.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you watched
"Mulholland Drive,"

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.331 align:middle line:84%
you'll see in the
background, there's

00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
kind of this little dude
who's in a room that's

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
separated by a glass.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically
calling the shots

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
as to who gets what
role in what film.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And it represents kind of that--
it's a mafia situation there,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
as well as in his film,
"Lost Highway," where

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
you have the mafia kind of
in the background running,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:84%
in some degree,
who gets what role.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
emblematic of kind

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.615 align:middle line:84%
of the shadow operators,
in determining

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:11.614 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of things
that you're talking about.

00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was asking
you last night.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Your dad did a great film
called "Nixon," as you know.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And he included in that the
William Butler Yeats poem.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And Yeats was very
influenced by Crowley.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when Nixon's talking
to Richard Helms of the CIA,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about the
Beast, and slouching

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
towards Bethlehem, right?

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
that there has to be

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
some sort of telluric
influence, or some sort

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
of astral influence, that
influences the creators,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't necessarily
know what's going on.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we talked this last
time on "Buzzsaw," you know,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.465 align:middle line:84%
they're putting things
into their art--

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think artists have always
done this-- even if they're not

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:90%
immediately conscious of it.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the actual
purpose of this, I mean,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
there's a notion of
predictive programming, right?

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
That the idea is we're
trying to maybe prepare you

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.885 align:middle line:84%
for certain shifts in the
collective consciousness,

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:05.685 align:middle line:90%
let's say, right?

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So they'll put out
movies that are designed--

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
for example, like you
mentioned war propaganda.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it to sell war?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Is it to sell lifestyles?

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as the
sort of marketing agenda

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
behind mainstream
media and film?

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- well,
we mentioned earlier,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
sort of these intelligence
agencies that have worked

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.779 align:middle line:84%
together with academia to
study the power of film.

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the social
engineers-- people, say,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.695 align:middle line:84%
from the Tavistock
Institute-- was like

00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:84%
and they understand the
power of storytelling.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
And all the way back to Plato,
and Plato's "Republic"--

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of lectures
on Plato's "Republic."

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:84%
it was understood that you could
create and control mythology--

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the "noble lie,"
Plato called it--

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that could guide the
civilization the way that you

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:90%
wanted to take it.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.672 align:middle line:84%
And then even into
the modern era,

00:08:51.672 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
with people like
Auguste Comte, who

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
proposed the idea of creating
a civic religion that the state

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
would completely
control, this would

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.874 align:middle line:84%
have to work in tandem with some
sort of myth-making apparatus.

00:09:02.874 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And in our day, that would
be, of course, Hollywood.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.797 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, the
implementation of what

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
you're calling
predictive programming,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
or this sort of conditioning,
I think it's multi-tiered.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have on one
level, perhaps,

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
product placement, which
might be selling something.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.614 align:middle line:84%
Like James Bond's got, you know,
an Omega watch or something.

00:09:20.614 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But then you've also got
a deeper level of it,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
where it's perhaps war
propaganda or conditioning,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, you know, the
hero's getting a microchip,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.089 align:middle line:90%
or something like this, right?

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And then there's that
deeper, deeper level,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.389 align:middle line:84%
which I think is the esoteric
level you're talking about,

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that could be either
good or bad, depending

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:84%
on what the intention of the
people making the film are.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
It could be something geared
towards awakening people,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
or it could be something
more nefarious about sort

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
of hoodwinking you with
these different symbols,

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.437 align:middle line:90%
and numerology, and so forth.

00:09:49.437 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And if it's something
predicting-- you know,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
we've seen this so many times,
where films show something

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that happens two, three,
four, five, 10 years later--

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's a form
of conditioning to make

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.887 align:middle line:84%
the populace more readily accept
what the long-term strategy is

00:10:04.887 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of the social engineers
down the road.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the notion
of the Illuminati shaping

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:90%
worldview, for example, right?

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.347 align:middle line:84%
>> We get-- I would say that
there's singularity moments.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:84%
There are points in time
that completely transform

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.596 align:middle line:90%
the worldview of the public.

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
You could say 9/11 was
that shift in time.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
back to Kubrick,

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and doing "2001," which is just
fascinating, because 2001 just

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
as a number, as a year,
was an interesting choice.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about,
basically, these moments

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
of transformations
of consciousness

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:90%
because of the obelisk.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well,
is Kubrick someone

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
who picked up on, basically,
the Illuminati agenda?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Do we-- do we think that
there is a controlled agenda

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
of a small nefarious cult?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.915 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just
think, again, it's

00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
more of these filmmakers who
are sort of, how do you say,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
feeling astral influences,
who are basically aware.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
They're tapping into
their unconscious.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:90%
They're smart, intuitive people.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Or do you see it as,
there is an Illuminati?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:90%
There is a group--

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I think--

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --that has a certain
agenda they're trying to push,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
trying to shape our worldview?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I think with some directors,
it's the influence that

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about, that
sort of is coming to them

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.759 align:middle line:84%
But then I think in Kubrick's
case, it's a bit unique.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I think he really was
showing the pattern of who

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%
our rulers are.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's such a consistent
pattern in all of his films.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.763 align:middle line:84%
So you've got "Dr.
Strangelove," which

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
deals with the Rand
Corporation being satirized

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and sort of made fun of.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very real entity that
was essentially constructing

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.912 align:middle line:90%
the entire Cold War.

00:11:29.912 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
That was who was
in the background,

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
with mutually assured
destruction and rational choice

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
theory, game theory, all these
different techniques that could

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
be applied to the mass mind.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
their function.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And then if you look at other
films like "Barry Lyndon,"

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick did, you're looking
at sort of the class struggle.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And you've got-- I mean,
pedophilia comes up

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
all the time in Kubrick films.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, he did
"Lolita," right?

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all
these different themes

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
consistently present.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
"Eyes Wide Shut,"
obviously, shows

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:06.340 align:middle line:84%
the elite being pretty much
obsessed with sex magic.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
"Hoodwinking,"-- again, the
character bill Hartford,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:90%
played by Tom Cruise.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that pattern
throughout Kubrick's film shows

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that in his case-- and
you mentioned "2001"--

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
he's showing us the perspective
of the elite of what you might

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:90%
call the Illuminati.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the issue of
UFOs oftentimes coming up?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Historically, they've always
been part of, obviously, film.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that
they're, in a sense,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to condition us for
the ultimate revelations

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
or ultimate disclosure that
will occur in time, of the fact

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that yes, there are alien
beings on this planet,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
there are non-human entities
that have been here?

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, sort
of using-- again,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
like "2001" is one such
case, of a film that

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
does indicate
extraterrestrial involvement

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
in the creation of man.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So do we think that these
UFO and secret space program

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
type of movies are sort of
predictive programming for us?

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that if you
look at the alien mythos,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you can go back to
somebody like HG Wells,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
who was so influential on not
just future science-fiction

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
writers, but even filmmakers.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So anything that you might see
from, say, Spielberg or Kubrick

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that deals with
science fiction, you

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
have to look back to HG Wells.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And HG Wells was actually
predicting in 1901 or 1902,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in that time
frame, traveling to the moon.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So even back then, he
wrote an explicit story

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.764 align:middle line:84%
about astronauts
traveling to the moon

00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and what they might find there,
and ancient civilizations,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:90%
things like this.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at "Island
of Dr. Moreau,"

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
he's writing about genetic
modification and engineering.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look at "The Time
Machine," he's, in a way,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
writing about atomics and the
possibility of nuclear fallout

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is 80 to
100 years before--

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he predicted the
nuclear war, for example.

00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> During the First World War,
he was talking about nuclear

00:13:59.510 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
bombs.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've got "The
Shape of Things to Come,"

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
which describes all
kinds of modern amenities

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.452 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when you look at
something like that-- and then

00:14:10.452 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
"War of the Worlds"
obviously talks

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
about the arrival of
aliens and so forth-- I

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
see it more as a conditioning
to accept a new kind of religion

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that will be offered.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So not so much as a
revelation of the existence

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of other entities or things
like this-- which I do

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
think there are spiritual
entities that exist,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.712 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
extrabiological.

00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that what's
going to happen

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to
see, through Hollywood

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and the presentation of a lot
of these movies-- like something

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
like "Prometheus," where you've
got the alien Engineers, that

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
have sort of tweaked man along
the way-- you're going to see

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
the blending of the
traditional Darwinian mythos

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that was so prevalent
in HG Wells' stories

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
alien mythos to give us

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
the idea of, essentially,
a new religion

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to replace the old traditional
religions of the West.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the paths that
seems to be leading us towards

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
this massive transformation,
this New World Order

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.555 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, in a sense, does
seem to be a civil war concept.

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we
can point to the fact

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to be occurring
in Europe, in the formation

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Arab immigrants
vying with the indigenous--

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.132 align:middle line:84%
well, the local
Europeans, who have also

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
obviously transplanted
over the course of time.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, there's
civil war brewing in Europe.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And in America, you have a lot
of civil war tension, you know,

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
Trump-versus-Hillary dialogue

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that's going on, and
obviously the Black

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Lives Matter versus
the police force.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.904 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
brewing hostilities.

00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But then you see movies that
have come out the last couple

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
years, and it's a lot of focus
on "Captain America: Civil

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.307 align:middle line:84%
War," "Batman v Superman,"
"The Free State of Jones,"

00:15:48.307 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
about the Civil War, "Birth of
a Nation," about the Civil War,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and even "Neighbors 2."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's a lot
of symbolism, I would say.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Even shows like "Bloodlines,"
like the symbolism

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:90%
of brother versus brother.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is being--
do you think this is part

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.325 align:middle line:90%
of predictive programming--

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:04.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --by, again, by the
elite, to potentially put us

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:84%
in a condition of
conflict with each other?

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can find-- on
the plane ride over here,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
I was actually reading one of
the top military strategists

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:84%
from the sort of neoconservative
camp, Steven Mann.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a famous essay
about chaos strategy.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
you can actually

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.150 align:middle line:84%
exploit weaknesses
in other countries

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.529 align:middle line:84%
through the implementation
of democracy.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not democracy the
way that we think about it,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's rather the
idea of hyping up

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
racial and political
divisions between, say,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.786 align:middle line:84%
existing groups in
Syria, or the Ukraine.

00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these different
[? color ?] revolutions,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
which have been funded
by Soros and the State

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Department, Victoria Nuland,
these different shadow

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
state, deep state, State
Department entities--

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> National Endowment for
Democracy, in particular.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.097 align:middle line:84%
What they do is that they
will go and study a region,

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
do an ethnography, which is what
the CIA does where they learn

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
everything about a
culture, its habits,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
its techniques, its
modes of speaking.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tailor
all the propaganda

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.151 align:middle line:84%
to exploit any possible
divisions in those regions.

00:17:08.151 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
And so then what happens is it
moves into a stage of what's

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:11.852 align:middle line:90%
called hybrid warfare.

00:17:11.852 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And hybrid warfare--
there's a great book

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.939 align:middle line:84%
by a guy named Andrew
Korybko, a Russian analyst who

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book on hybrid warfare.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says you can
actually predict

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
where any of the
next hot spots are

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
going to be based on where any
proposed future infrastructure

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:90%
or pipelines might be.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you're going
to see al-Qaeda, or ISIS,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
or these different
proxies pop up.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.842 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in
the US domestically,

00:17:34.842 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:90%
it's the exact same strategy.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.508 align:middle line:84%
So I've written a
bunch of articles

00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
on how the think tanks
and the NGOs, they

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
will actually tailor
their approach

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.306 align:middle line:90%
to each specific group.

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So if it's like a
women's rights group,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
or if it's Black Lives
Matter, something like that,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll have propaganda that's
tailored towards that group,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to what's called agitprop, to
agitate through this propaganda

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to cause the division.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.446 align:middle line:90%
And you mentioned Hollywood.

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And because people don't get
their worldview from the news,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
generally, most people
get it from the theater.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So Hollywood's
crucial in that role

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of being sort of the pivot
point between the establishment

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and the mass mind,
in terms of hyping up

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
these tensions and
destabilization, basically.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, just given
your geopolitical analysis

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and psychological
warfare study, what

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
do you think is-- let's
look into our crystal

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
ball for a moment and just
think, what might be coming

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
for America in the next
four, four to five years,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
let's say, under-- well, whoever
is president doesn't really

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
matter, I think.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
There's already a strategy
that's being implemented.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what you see as the
essential-- sort of if you just

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:84%
look, predict the
future a little bit,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
based on what you're seeing
in movies and music and media?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the techniques
have the ability--

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of a technology
of-- what they do in the Middle

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.635 align:middle line:90%
East is called microstates.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when you break
up these regions,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.370 align:middle line:84%
you create just smaller and
smaller niches of people,

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.114 align:middle line:84%
and that's much
easier to control.

00:19:03.114 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think in the
US, you're going

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to see sort of greater
and greater fragmentation

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:84%
of different
regions, who will be

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
sort of-- not necessarily
a civil war of North

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:90%
versus South.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.306 align:middle line:84%
But you'll have--
you know, people

00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
in, say, large
metropolitan areas

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
are going to view people who are
rural as sort of their enemy.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.919 align:middle line:90%
You'll have the racial tensions.

00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
going to be greater

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and greater fragmentation.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, the Pentagon,
Steven Mann, they

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
even write about how this
is a technique, a tactic.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Goes all the way back to
Caesar and the Galician Wars,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:84%
where we talked about dividing
them up through propaganda.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.965 align:middle line:84%
Machiavelli talks
about this in his--

00:19:36.965 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
he has his own book, "Art of
War," modeled after Sun Tzu.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Book six of Machiavelli's
treatise, he says,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.915 align:middle line:84%
you can use all these
tricks and tactics.

00:19:45.915 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting you
mentioned the pipeline wars

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.914 align:middle line:84%
of the Middle East, but I think
we have pipeline wars is coming

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:51.714 align:middle line:90%
to America itself.

00:19:51.714 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're
seeing it right now.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Obviously originally, it was
against the Keystone Pipeline.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Now it's becoming much more
intense, with actual violence

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
against Native
American protesters,

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:90%
for example, in North Dakota.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Pressure-- it's pressure
from above and from below

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:90%
at the same time, absolutely.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But so do you think that
a lot of this tension

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.190 align:middle line:84%
is being orchestrated
because of the issue

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that elite want to push, for
pipelines and for continuing

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
the oil and gas industry?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one aspect of it.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.259 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think Big Oil is a
big part of the power structure.

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have a bunch
of other aspects, too.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.133 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back to the
Royal Society and the way

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:31.239 align:middle line:84%
that they've talked about social
engineering for so long, if you

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
look at the way Bertrand Russell
talked about the population,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
he was just
ultimately so devious

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.891 align:middle line:84%
and said, essentially,
in his book,

00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
"Impact of Science on
Society," that you'd

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.921 align:middle line:90%
have to stamp out man's spirit.

00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
in the long run,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it's not so much about
just regional conflicts

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:90%
or pipelines.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about the
stamping out of man's spirit,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:90%
like we see in "1984."

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
O'Brien know, O'Brien
tells Winston,

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.472 align:middle line:84%
it's a boot on your
face for all eternity.

00:20:57.472 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I'm not trying
to be scaremongering,

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.201 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying
that's the technique

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:90%
of the social engineers.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:84%
That's their goal, is to have
a bunch of drones, basically,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:84%
who are just corporate
cubicle mind-bombed idiots.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.975 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mentioned
earlier about

00:21:12.975 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
how they're trying to create
a new religion, essentially,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and that UFOs or
extraterrestrials

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
might play a role.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.329 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard, obviously,
the Catholic church now issuing

00:21:20.329 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:84%
proclamations about
how everyone--

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
we have intergalactic
brothers, basically,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
a brotherhood of all beings,
including intergalactic beings.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So aliens could be part
of this new religion.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But also, I think Hollywood
has become a new religion,

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a ritual feel to it.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
You go into a
theater, or you watch

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:90%
this-- you take this space.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:90%
You watch this film.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:90%
The lights are dim.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And we've known
that it's oftentimes

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
been a tool for selling
sex and violence.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a crude way of
saying it, but there

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
does seem to be this sort of
sex magic and blood ritual that

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:90%
takes place on screen.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Is that how people potentially
should view what's actually

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
being-- that there
is an actual ritual

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
being enacted when
they're watching a movie?

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.574 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you
can find quotes,

00:22:02.574 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and I've put them in my
book, where Orson Welles said

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that he viewed his creation
of film like a magic ritual.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And he loved to-- if you've
ever seen "F for Fake,"

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
he's even kind of
showing what he's

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
up to with-- the film presents
these fictional scenarios,

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and he says, three
of these are lies.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:90%
One of them is true.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.074 align:middle line:84%
You've got to figure
out which one's which.

00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the
point of the film

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is to show you that
Hollywood is kind of a trick.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a magic trick.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It's an excellent sort
of pre-documentary-style

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
mockumentary that pioneered
the way for that genre.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.155 align:middle line:84%
But I think that Wells
is good for showing that.

00:22:43.155 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that you can
look at other directors,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
like David Lynch.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And he speaks of his films as,
more or less, ritual workings.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He says that he
views himself as kind

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of the shaman in
between two worlds.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And so "Twin Peaks," the
famous "Fire Walk With Me" line

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is actually about the shamanic
journey between two worlds

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
to be inspired for
your artistic vision.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:90%
I think that--

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.795 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it's ironic,
because "Twin Peaks," to me,

00:23:08.795 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is all about trauma-based
mind control.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think of the
Twin Towers as a form

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.451 align:middle line:90%
of trauma-based mind control.

00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the funny thing

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is you have Twin Pines Mall
in "Back to the Future"

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that becomes "One Pine Mall"
after he goes back in time.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you did a great
breakdown of that, yeah.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.422 align:middle line:84%
So there's interesting symbols
that are fed into these movies.

00:23:25.422 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking,
well, is it all part

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:90%
of this predictive program?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, maybe
there is-- maybe

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
there is an esoteric
influence that

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is guiding the entire process
of what filmmakers are going

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
through, in order to
tell us-- basically,

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:84%
to prepare us for
what is coming.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, you know, again,
going back to the space

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
question, Kubrick,
you've studied,

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and many people have alleged
he was involved in filming

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:90%
the moon landings.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And one allegation
is not because we

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't go to the moon, but
because our space program is

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
actually a secret space program
that it has billions, if not

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
trillions of dollars invested
into it, that's so far beyond,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
it's closer to "Star Trek"
than those little shuttles

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and "Explorers" that
are shown to the public.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> B-movie stuff.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you make of that?

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it's very
possible that Kubrick was

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
filming something that was
kind of a front or a facade

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:90%
to distract.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there's
a covert operation,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
a covert program, that is far
more vast, far more expansive,

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
has a lot more money than these
sort of dinky little ships

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and models that look
like B-movies, right?

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's definitely
what's going on in it.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at "2001," we
mentioned earlier-- in my book

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
what I did was I analyzed
it from the perspective

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:90%
of philosophy and metaphysics.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I argued that when he's
saying "A Space Odyssey,"

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not just outer
space, but it's actually

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of space itself, like
six-dimensional space--

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
up, down, left, right,
forward, backward.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
a cue, right?

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So all of the six dimensions
possible within space.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
the monolith represents

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:84%
man's evolutionary ascent
beyond the limitations

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:90%
of spatial dimensions and time.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
Kubrick sees it as that,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and that the elite then have
this claim this divine right,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.174 align:middle line:90%
to space, all space.

00:25:18.174 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you get
the breakaway civilization.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And "2001" actually is a
breakaway civilization story.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Because Star Child
basically nukes the world

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
after you have the ascent of--
this apotheosis of Star Child,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.350 align:middle line:90%
who comes out of Bowman, right?

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
In the film presentation,
at least, right?

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that
the monolith kind of

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
represents AI and man's
transhumanist sort of ascent.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And then through AI, at least,
Kubrick's potential thesis

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is that man can transcend
his limitations that way.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how I view it.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly, we're on the
cusp of artificial intelligence

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in so many capacities that it's
clear it's going to be a major

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:90%
factor.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's already a major factor
in many films and TV shows.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But what are some
techniques that people

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
can use when viewing media or
listening to music to start

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to recognize, well,
there's something--

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:84%
there's either something
symbolic that's

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
being shown to me,
or there's something,

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
some kind of programming,
that's being offered.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So how can they
learn to recognize

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and start be just
more discerning when

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:90%
they view media?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it
almost can't be done,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:84%
unless there's kind of a basic
philosophical perspective that

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
what I try to do,

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
is give people Philosophy 101.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that would include
things like understanding

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:90%
how we know what we know.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It would include basic logical
fallacies and understanding

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
how logic works.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Which might sound
a little obtuse,

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.161 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
not that difficult,

00:26:48.161 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
when you can actually just
print out the main fallacies.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now that may sound unconnected
to film but it's not.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Because even though you're
being presented a story

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.034 align:middle line:84%
line, if you're watching
something like "Zero Dark

00:27:00.034 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Thirty," or if you're
watching something

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
like "American Sniper," if you
understand what you're being

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.857 align:middle line:84%
presented with, that this is
coming from the establishment,

00:27:08.857 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
then you can already
kind of recognize

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be telling
you a message for a reason.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
They want you to accept
something for a reason.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you just have
a basic knowledge

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of non-contradiction-- which
is one of the basic fallacies--

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to know
that what they're presenting

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:90%
you is not true.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously there
has to be some research,

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
too, I think, in terms
of how we understand

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
the history of Hollywood,
the history of mass media,

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and what these
entities exist for.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist for what
most people think they're for.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:90%
So basic education.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always felt that
when something comes out,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a film or
music, that strikes me as not

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.899 align:middle line:84%
necessarily being from a
place of truth or purity,

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:84%
or that might not have
the best intention--

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
like an "American Sniper" or
like some of this very crude

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:90%
music--

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.647 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I don't watch it
at the time it comes out,

00:27:57.647 --> 00:27:58.563 align:middle line:90%
I'm not participating.

00:27:58.563 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not putting my energy
towards the ritual, in a sense.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That at least that's the
only thing I can actually do

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to maintain some sense
of sovereignty of self,

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and basically not
to feed the beast.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great point.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that that's
something people can do,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.231 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is to not
necessarily engage with it

00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
right away, as part
of that mass hysteria?

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.908 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things that
a ritual working is intended

00:28:16.908 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:90%
to do is to sap energy.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.714 align:middle line:84%
And so once-- these
sort of media spectacles

00:28:21.714 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
or big blockbusters,
what they do,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
as viewed from the
ritual perspective,

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
is that they focus
everyone's intention, right?

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So rather than you being
independent and able to have

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
your own will
towards life, you're

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
taking two hours,
whatever it is,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and being sucked into somebody
else's presentation, which

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.842 align:middle line:84%
is intended to steer you
in a certain direction

00:28:42.842 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and program you,
in a sense, right?

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying you
can't watch any films.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying that I think
you'd have to wisely choose

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
how you use your time.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's intended to
sap your energy and your focus,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
which you should
direct your own way.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks so much for
coming on today, Jay.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.009 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your time.

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:03.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:29:03.587 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And there you have it, folks.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Some great insights
from Jay Dyer.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully we can help you,
through this conversation,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
understand how important your
own energy and sovereignty

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
really is to you and to
the world around you.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's not feed into a
beast and a machine that

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:84%
propagates war and violence
and subjugation of others.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I urge you to read Jay's books
for much more detail, specially

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
"Esoteric Hollywood," as well
as his blog, Jay's Analysis,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.839 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:29:28.839 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And remember this--
the road to truth

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
is a perilous path along
the edge of the buzzsaw.
