Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

And joining me today
is Billy Carson,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Topics he covers range from the
ancient suppressed knowledge

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
to current events
of the present day.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:10%
Billy is a contributor
to Huffington Post

top UFO hunters in the world

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:10%
to form the United Family
of Anomaly Hunters.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, he teams up with us
to uncover hidden knowledge.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.524 align:middle line:84%
So, Billy, you're quite
entrepreneurial and looking

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
at your bio, it says that you
have a space travel company.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would start by asking
you, what does that mean

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.547 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
actually working on?

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a good question.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:10%
Basically, we have
a space agency.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.949 align:middle line:10%
We don't have launch capability,
so we don't launch rockets.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't
realize is there's actually

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
a lot of space
agencies out there

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that provide ancillary tools,
research, and development

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.417 align:middle line:84%
for like SpaceX, NASA, and
the European Space Agency.

00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we're doing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
is we're specializing in
research and development

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
of alternative propulsion
systems and zero point energy

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.692 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're really experimenting
in different ways

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
to get lifting of
vehicles off the ground

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
as well as being
able to transport

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
these vehicles with their own
internal energy power source.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And typically, what happens is
you go by usually by battery

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.905 align:middle line:90%
power or recirculating energy.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going to
provide energy sources that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
can extrapolate energy right out
of the atmosphere or our ether

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
basically as well as using
magnetic propulsion technology.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So and basically in zero point
energy and these theories

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that you're working
with, are you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:90%
looking to certain theorists?

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I would think of like
Tesla, for example,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.156 align:middle line:84%
or even potentially like even
like wormhole or stargate

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
technology, which
has been talked

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
about in the ancient past.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So are you looking to
the more recent past

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.554 align:middle line:90%
or to the ancient past?

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We've actually have gone
ancient, I mean super ancient,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.136 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to the
Mahabharata and the Bhagavad

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Gita, which are some
ancient Indian texts.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
In there, they
talk about Vimanas.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And in these Vimanas
were talked about

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and written about that
actually had mercury engines

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and were able to levitate and
fly silently across the land

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and transport the kings and
elites from place to place.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So we actually looked
into that and said,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.384 align:middle line:90%
could this be possibly real?

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the more we looked
into it, the more

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:84%
we found that it could
potentially be very, very

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%
real theoretically.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So we started experimenting
with different concepts

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
of using mercury because
that's what they used.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And mercury is a ferrofluid.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a liquid metal.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:10%
So we discovered that by
putting this liquid metal

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:10%
into a torus, which is a
steel torus with a reversed

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:10%
magnetic field inside of it
to keep the actual ferrofluid

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.014 align:middle line:10%
from touching the inside.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you actually can
bring it up to a rotation,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to an RPM of about 50,000.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that and then
pressurize that torus

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to about 250,000
pressures, you then

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
get this amazing
anti-gravity bubble.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And what you get
complete anti-gravity

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
but you do get to reduce
the weight of an object

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
with anything within the
range of that torus field

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.985 align:middle line:84%
will be reduced by up to
70%, the weight, the mass.

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
of the theories

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that we're experimenting with.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're very excited
about it because it really

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
looks like we'll be able
to provide something that

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
could potentially provide
anti-gravity or reduce

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.125 align:middle line:90%
the mass of an object.

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So you see these companies
that are basically

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:84%
working to privatize the
space endeavors, companies

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:90%
like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
this is ultimately

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:84%
a benefit for mankind's
initiative toward traveling

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:90%
toward space?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Or will these
companies ultimately

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
just privatize the
gains and basically

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
keep them secret
from the public?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to work
a little bit both ways.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of the technology,
some of the discoveries

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.885 align:middle line:84%
will be provided to
the general population

00:04:03.885 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
where it says citizens
of this planet.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.464 align:middle line:90%
But not the really big ones.

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:10.435 align:middle line:84%
And I think, and I
can't say this for sure,

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's in part
because they've probably

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
signed agreements with the
military industrial complex,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
NASA, whoever it is,
the bigger organization,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
to keep some of the bigger
discoveries top secret

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.469 align:middle line:84%
because it's got to go
through a filter first.

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
They just can't go
out there and say,

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
look, we found this
entire civilization, all

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of this technology laying
around, look, everybody.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go through
a step-by-step process.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the powers
that be will then

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
decide who gets access to what,
who gets a chance to see what.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Overall, the private industries
will profit significantly

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:90%
from this.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
citizens of the world

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
will be spoon fed a
little bit at a time.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.287 align:middle line:84%
>> So why is it that the
government over the past few

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
years, especially under Obama,
for example they cut back

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
on NASA's manned endeavors
toward space for example,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
what is the motivation
to cut back on NASA,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
which does seem to have been a
tremendous initiative for a lot

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of what we know as far as the
probes of space and whatnot

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
but also it seems that there
is sort of a deep cover element

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
within NASA as well.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
There is the notorious
relationship with the Nazis

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that were brought
over after the war.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So do you think NASA is
ultimately losing power

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're transferring more of
a role to the private companies

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
or is NASA still a
prominent component

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.549 align:middle line:84%
in the entire endeavor
to understand space?

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
very good question.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's happening
is NASA is a front

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
for a much bigger program,
the SSP or the secret space

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And what NASA is planning
to do, basically,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.382 align:middle line:84%
is they're going to continue to
progress through private space

00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:84%
because through private
space, you can actually

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:90%
cover a lot more things up.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
When you're a public or
public access type of company

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
or a company run
by the government,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.737 align:middle line:84%
then people can put in
Freedom of Information Acts.

00:05:53.737 --> 00:05:54.945 align:middle line:90%
They can request information.

00:05:54.945 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
They can say, hey, where
are our dollars going here?

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.625 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We need to see
what you're doing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
This is why NASA releases those
images from Mars and Venus

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and Mercury and all
these other planets

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
we go to because they have to.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But if it was done by a
private space industry,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't have
to release anything.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So through private
space, you can

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
keep things a lot more
secret because you bypass

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
the whole government objective
and you bypass the citizens

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.963 align:middle line:84%
So you can really get a lot more
things done behind the scenes

00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
than you can by
staying in public.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think is
the ultimate, let's say,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
purpose or destiny of man
when it comes to space travel?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
humans will ultimately

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
be going and colonizing Mars
in the coming millennia,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think
that ultimately it

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
will basically space
travel be secured

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
for a small elite group that
perhaps are even traveling

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
in space, in your opinion?

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that the
biggest objective overall

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
for space travel is to
secure the human race.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it's
a very small list

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
allowed to get access

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
to these breakaway
civilizations.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.371 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
that there probably

00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
are multiple breakaway
civilizations right now

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and expanding.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they're
looking for specific types

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.761 align:middle line:84%
of genetic makeups, people were
different types of abilities,

00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it be
technology, whether it

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
be sciences, whether it
be even construction.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's a
very small hand-picked group

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of people that are going to
these breakaway civilizations

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and starting these
infrastructures.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
overall in general,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.764 align:middle line:84%
the general population,
for the most,

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
might not even
never know about it

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
or maybe many
centuries down the road

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
will then eventually have free
access to go back and forth.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.195 align:middle line:84%
But I think initially, it's
going to be kept to the elites.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A prominent theory that's
circulating now is this Flat

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Earth Theory.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.494 align:middle line:84%
And so according to
that one, I think

00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the argument is that
we've never actually left

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:90%
the stratosphere, right?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.858 align:middle line:84%
We've never even
traveled in space.

00:07:48.858 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of the images that
are sent back basically

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:90%
are just doctored and concocted.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And do you think there's
anything valid in how this Flat

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Earth idea?

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing valid
in Flat Earth whatsoever.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I really empathize
with the people who

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:90%
have fallen for the propaganda.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's really a psyop, a
psychological operation

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that was kind of put
forth by admittedly,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
actually, by the CIA
several years back.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
People kind of took
it and ran with it.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.527 align:middle line:84%
And what their whole premise
is that the Earth is flat

00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and that we're living in a dome.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we see up top is just
a projection or a computer

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.595 align:middle line:90%
program or some type of a--

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they
correlate the sun to it all.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But basically and
there's an edge.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.695 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
that's not the case.

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The laws of physics
wouldn't even

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
work in this third
dimension with that.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It's really almost an insult
in the way to our ancestors.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors knew.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:90%
They say NASA, NASA lies.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, forget NASA.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.274 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the ancients.

00:08:47.274 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's been
some circulation

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.106 align:middle line:84%
of lies about the Annunaki
saying that the Earth was flat.

00:08:51.106 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Total lies.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
These are people, again,
who are propaganda,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
paid propaganda agents
putting information out there.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The Annunaki never once in
any text any tablet anywhere

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
have ever said the
Earth was flat.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They talked about,
matter of fact,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:84%
when Alalu was being
sentenced to die on Mars,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:84%
the tablets talk about this
ship that Alalu and Anu were in,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
orbiting Mars several
orbits before they actually

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:90%
found the spot to land.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
How do you orbit
something that's flat?

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is even another planet.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.687 align:middle line:84%
They talk about, Anu talks
about encircling the planet

00:09:21.687 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
several times before finding the
perfect place when he decided

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to pick Mesopotamia
as the official spot,

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
even though Alalu had landed
here many thousand years prior,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.359 align:middle line:90%
Anu took his own rounds.

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And said, OK, this
is the place where

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.441 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
ahead and establish

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
the first major
civilization here.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.467 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is talking
about a spherical Earth.

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And you go into the
Sumerian cylinder scroll

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
where you actually can
see that they depict

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
all the planets orbiting the
sun, they're all spheres,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and even their own
captured planet

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is on this cylinder
scroll as well.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.024 align:middle line:84%
And so they depict
the Earth as round.

00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go into
some of the biblical text,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Enoch actually went on a
planned trip in a spaceship

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.559 align:middle line:84%
with the Annunaki, when you
really digest it and really

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:90%
break it down is what happened.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.429 align:middle line:84%
He even told his son, here,
these are their sacred records,

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:90%
guard them, so forth and so on.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.761 align:middle line:84%
It was an appointed day
they were going to leave.

00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like they just
showed up and took them.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, he described the
Earth in the book of Enoch

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:90%
as a sphere.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can go
to the Dogon Tribe.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't not only describe
the Earth as a sphere,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
they knew every planet in
our solar system, the color,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
the shape, and the sizes
of all the planets, Neptune

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and everything else, Uranus.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And they even knew
about a solar system

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
outside of our solar system,
where Sirius B and Sirius A.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Sirius B is actually a
star we just discovered in

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
like the late 1960s,
I believe, or '70s.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They knew about this
for thousands of years.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of their
history that they brought down

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%
step-by-step.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.525 align:middle line:84%
And they actually talk about
this star being a failed star,

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
a start that ran out of fuel.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Nomo came
here from this star.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.336 align:middle line:84%
These were some
Annunaki-type fish people

00:10:53.336 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that actually came here and
taught them some information.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.418 align:middle line:84%
But basically, so we
can keep going back.

00:10:57.418 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The Zulu, the Zulu Nation
in Africa, they as well

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:84%
knew of all the planets,
the shapes, the sizes.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.079 align:middle line:84%
So to say that the Earth is flat
and to say that NASA is a liar,

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, you can say that NASA lied.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
NASA has lied.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.568 align:middle line:84%
They've covered up
a lot of things.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to the ancient
texts and figure that out.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.722 align:middle line:84%
The ancients have all stated
that the Earth is a sphere.

00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the Piri Reis map,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
the Piri Reis map shows
the Earth as a sphere.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It shows Antarctica before
it even had ice on it.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
if you actually

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
look at the Piri
Reis map from above,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.812 align:middle line:84%
you have to be positioned
directly over Giza, Egypt,

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to make that exact layout
of the Piri Reis map.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So whoever started that map,
the official original first one,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
was taken from space
looking down on on Giza.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And even looking at other
planets in our solar system.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea would
be that all those planets

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
have been doctored as far as the
Flat Earth Theory is concerned.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're saying.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But meanwhile, you're looking
at a lot of the anomalies that

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.897 align:middle line:84%
have been found from
the NASA photos.

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And talk about some
of the discoveries

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you've seen on
different planets,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.997 align:middle line:84%
whether it be Mars,
Venus, even Pluto.

00:11:55.997 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that
you found anomalies

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:84%
with your anomaly
hunters, right?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
We found anomalies.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of the United
Family of Anomaly Hunters.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
We've literally downloaded
over 1 million images now,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
the whole group of
us, and we picked out

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:90%
about 50,000 total anomalies.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The majority of them
are on Mars because we

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:90%
have the most data from Mars.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
These anomalies,
what is an anomaly?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
An anomaly is an
out-of-place object,

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
something that shows geometry,
something that almost appears

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
to be like a biological
organism or something that's

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:90%
out of place.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And how we do this,
we pull down raw data

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.226 align:middle line:84%
directly from the European
Space Agency server, the NASA

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
servers, and the Indian
Space Agency servers,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and we actually pull them
down into our computers.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
We magnify them.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We literally get out
magnifying glasses

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.191 align:middle line:84%
and go inch-by-inch sometimes
millimeter-by-millimeter

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:90%
looking at these images.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
When we spot something, OK, we
see this rock outcropping here,

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
this particular object doesn't
match this outcropping.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.382 align:middle line:84%
We pull them in and we really
analyze them in detail.

00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%
We open them up in Photoshop.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We take a better
look and we take away

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:84%
some of the haze, some
of the false fudging

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:90%
that's been put over them.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.506 align:middle line:84%
And once we do that,
we see what's there.

00:12:57.506 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
If we vote on it and say,
OK, this is definitely

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.161 align:middle line:84%
something that's there, then
we put it out on our site

00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and we say, look, here's another
anomaly that we discovered,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.147 align:middle line:90%
something that's out of place.

00:13:06.147 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't specifically tell
you this is what it is,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.813 align:middle line:84%
but we can tell you that, look,
this is an out-of-place object

00:13:10.813 --> 00:13:12.304 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't belong in here.

00:13:12.304 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that we believe

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:90%
is naturally formed by nature.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what are some of the
things that appear to be as far

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:90%
as?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of structures.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We've seen structures
on Mercury.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.333 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, Mercury,
you can't have any.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is now the
Mercury Messenger Mission

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
has revealed that
Mercury has 47% oxygen,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
argon gases, hydrogen,
everything else.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You can literally
pop your helmet

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
off when you land on Mercury
and take a deep breath.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
The temperature isn't molten
lead like everybody thought.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.825 align:middle line:84%
Only at the equator
it's extremely hot.

00:13:37.825 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But towards the
poles, you actually

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
get a normalized temperature
because mercury takes 61 days

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to spin on its own axis.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So most of the planet's
never in the direct sunlight.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We found structures there,
structure after structure

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:90%
after structure.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.375 align:middle line:84%
And these structures, one of the
biggest ones that I discovered

00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
made international news,
is this one building

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be
almost a mile long.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.436 align:middle line:84%
And you can use a
measuring tool to tell

00:13:58.436 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
how big this structure is.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's backed up
to a canal or a lake.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's already
been revealed publicly

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that there are billions of tons
of water and gases on Mercury

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's not even
a secret anymore.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:10%
Venus as well, we've
discovered what

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:10%
appear to be structures, massive
structures, which appear to be

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:10%
intact, which is very bizarre.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:10%
Because if it's an ancient
society, why are these things?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, if something is here
and you go back and look at it

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
in 1,000 years, it looks pretty
destroyed or falling apart

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:90%
or demolished.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these structures
appear to be completely intact.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Mars, you can find destroyed
structures everywhere.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You can find remnants of ancient
civilizations and cities.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what appear to
be different types of machines

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
directly on the surface
just laying there.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of Mars
has been washed over.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.318 align:middle line:84%
You can tell, you can see
where it had a global flood

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the stuff
has been destroyed.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the moons that
orbit Saturn and Jupiter as

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.037 align:middle line:90%
well have evidence of pyramids.

00:14:54.037 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
All of these, by the way, have
pyramids, pyramids on our moon,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.501 align:middle line:84%
pyramids on Mercury,
pyramids on Venus,

00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
all the way across the
whole solar system.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So you almost indicate that,
as some people like Graham

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.713 align:middle line:84%
Hancock has talked about, a
civilization that was global

00:15:04.713 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
across the Earth, Atlantean,
let's say the Atlantean

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
civilization, you're saying it
was actually across the whole

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:90%
solar system.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Interplanetary, correct.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was basically
given to us by the Annunaki.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Annunaki, correct.

00:15:14.385 --> 00:15:15.799 align:middle line:90%
The same architect.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
If you read the Emerald
Tablets, I'm sorry.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.798 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you read the Emerald
Tablet, that's correct.

00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
A pharaoh himself who
wrote the Emerald Tablets,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.905 align:middle line:90%
it's his own handiwork.

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
didn't have a scribe

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.738 align:middle line:90%
to write this tablet for him.

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
He wrote these tablets
himself he claims.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
In there, he describes that
he built the Great Pyramid

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:90%
at Giza.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.704 align:middle line:84%
He designed it almost as like
a gigantic stone computer.

00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And he hid a lot
of secrets inside

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
of the actual construction,
which he absolutely did.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Then much later on, it was
falsely attributed to Khufu.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.601 align:middle line:84%
But really, Thoth
himself claims to have

00:15:45.601 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:90%
built the Great Pyramid.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.516 align:middle line:84%
And it's much, much older
than people can even

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
imagine as well as the Sphinx,
which he built as well.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And the face of the Sphinx
originally was his face.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.245 align:middle line:84%
But later on, his brother
who took over ancient Egypt

00:15:57.245 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
or the land of Khem
recarved the Sphinx's face

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.089 align:middle line:90%
to his own kid, his own son.

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But presumably, these
Annunaki that were here at one

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
point living amongst us, perhaps
even in some way altering

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or creating us, at some point,
they apparently left, correct?

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, correct.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And what caused that
ultimate their flight?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would say what does
the landscape look like?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Is this planet now human
controlled in the sense

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki are gone
so humans are in charge?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:29.981 align:middle line:84%
That would be really great
if we were really in charge.

00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, it's not.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.979 align:middle line:84%
There were two pyramid wars,
one from much further back

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and then things settle
down, and then there

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:90%
was a second pyramid war.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
These wars were always over the
same thing, control of humans,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
control of land, and
control of these tablets

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of destiny, which
have changed hands

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
a couple of different times.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And these Tablets of
Destiny, they're technology,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
they have the genetic
codes on them,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.007 align:middle line:90%
they have star maps in them.

00:16:52.007 --> 00:16:54.465 align:middle line:84%
All these things these tablets
in these Tablets of Destiny.

00:16:54.465 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's claimed whoever has
them has control over the Earth

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and over the galaxy
and so forth and so on.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But these wars
continue to persist.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And this last particular
one war was a nuclear war.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.266 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell because you can
read the descriptions of what's

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient text
between the Mahabharata,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:84%
the Bhagavad Gita, and the
Sumerian Cylinder Scrolls that

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
literally describes
radiation sickness, radiation

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
poisoning, and the
way the blast actually

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
looks as a mushroom
cloud when they go off.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And they found
glass in the sand,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
buildings have been
vitrified, and so forth.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.601 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what happened
was a lot of them left.

00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
They just took off and
got the heck out of here.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.707 align:middle line:90%
Some stayed.

00:17:29.707 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Some were actually
married already to humans

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and could not leave
because they were already

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.121 align:middle line:84%
banned from going back to their
home planet because of mating

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:90%
They stayed here.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But Amun-Ra, most
interestingly, who

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was the main target of some
of this second pyramid war

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to be killed and so
forth, he escaped.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But before he escaped,
he left the kingship

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to Ra-Kam, which is
his offspring of.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And the word Kam translates
into the word shield.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So you look and
you say Ra shield.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So right here, you
can see where we have

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
a depiction of the Ra shield.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, 6,000
years ago, already taking

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
control of the
finances in the kingdom

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.406 align:middle line:84%
from Amun-Ra, who was
the brother of Thoth.

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it persist
all the way to this day.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:84%
This is why you see a lot
of Egyptian-type themes

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
with the Queen of England
and so forth and so on

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
because the pharaohs eventually
migrated through Arabia then

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
into England and to
Europe, I would say,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and where they became kingdoms
and so forth and so on.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So and this has progressed all
the way into the Unites States

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to this current day.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
If you go from John Lackland,
who was the Plantagenet

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:84%
bloodline who was
directly related

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to the Arabian king
and the Sumerian kings,

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
his bloodline is also related
to every single President

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of the United States of
America, including Obama.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.733 align:middle line:84%
There's only one president
that wasn't directly related,

00:18:44.733 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that was Van Buren.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But Van Buren still
was related to royalty.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:84%
That particular year or
that particular election,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have a suitable
bloodline to take that spot.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But all from then through
right now, even Donald Trump

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:84%
who's related directly by
blood to this bloodline,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
That's who's running this
planet to this very day.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There's still that
bloodline here

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
the Germans as well.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans are actually
into this bloodline, involved

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
in blood, and entangled in it.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the leaders
that are running,

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
they're making a lot of
the background decisions

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.311 align:middle line:84%
are Germans, it's
Germanic in nature.

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's almost
like another Reich

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
still controlling and running
this planet right now.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And what would the intention be,
let's say, for these Annunaki

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
descendants in terms
of how they view humans

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and what they ultimately
see as far as this planet

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
as far as its
resources and people?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.194 align:middle line:84%
What is the value of
maintaining a kingship here?

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, unfortunately
for humans,

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:90%
they see humans as cattle.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.914 align:middle line:84%
Humans are just another
means to their end.

00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not really about
the money for them

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
because they have all the
money that they can want,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
the Rothschilds alone
are worth $700 trillion.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the money.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to control,
power, and utilizing humans

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.382 align:middle line:90%
to make their gains.

00:19:55.382 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
What are their gains
they're looking for?

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.714 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to
get off this planet.

00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
breakaway civilizations.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So they literally
use humans as cattle

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.674 align:middle line:84%
to generate and run
the planet, go to work,

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
generate revenue and
income that they can take

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and they can put into different
programs, black budget

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
programs, $7 trillion
missing here, $8 trillion

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
missing there.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not missing.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly
where the money is.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They're using this
money to get off planet.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And they have been.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the same thing goes
for the "We Buy Gold",

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
which is a black budget,
behind-the-scenes program.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Gold is one of the
most needed things

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
in the universe when you're
talking about space travel.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Gold is malleable.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You can actually put
electricity in on one end

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and get the same amount of
electricity on the other end

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
without losing anything
in the friction.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a very rare thing.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You can make it into
any shape or form.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
You could take it down
to the atomic level

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and actually make atomic
level microprocessors

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
with the gold, which you
would definitely need.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's also radiation proof
and it reflects sunlight

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.512 align:middle line:90%
and radiation very well.

00:20:52.512 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
you would need

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.877 align:middle line:84%
in radiation hardened
computer boards and so forth.

00:20:56.877 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:90%
This is why gold is so valuable.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was really what was
behind the entire "We Buy Gold"

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
That whole program's all
about, in my opinion,

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:90%
the secret space program.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And unknowingly, the
citizen says, oh, I

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
can turn my gold in
and get some money.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.654 align:middle line:84%
But it was a much, much
bigger project than that.

00:21:12.654 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So as we deepen our
understanding of the universe

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.707 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking oftentimes to
ancient text to help inform us,

00:21:18.707 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:90%
now we come up to current times.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And the matrix theory
is a very prominent one.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Some say Silicon
Valley billionaires

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
are willing to spend a lot
of money actually trying

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to prove that we live in
a computer simulation.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
What is your take on
how viable that is

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and if that fits into the
overall theory of what

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the ancients have passed on
to us about this universe we

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%
live in?

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good question.

00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go into
the Emerald Tablets,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
again, Thoth himself talks
about the holographic nature

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about his ability
to transfer his consciousness

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:90%
into other avatars.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.531 align:middle line:84%
So and you fast
forward into the future

00:21:55.531 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and what these guys are
starting to really figure out,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.204 align:middle line:84%
these quantum physicists
and theoretical physicists

00:22:00.204 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
are really starting
to figure out.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
One in particular
Sylvester James Gates,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
he's actually a professor at
the University of Maryland.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who
brought kind of, really,

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess you want to say,
streamline or focused

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
in on supersymmetry and
discovered that the actual

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
fabric of space time, the
actual ether itself runs off

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:90%
of 0's and 1's.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.551 align:middle line:84%
And it's a specific type
of code called adinkras.

00:22:22.551 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And these adinkras,
which actually go back

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Dogon Tribe,
believe it or not,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.150 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, these
adinkras actually

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
tell physicists that the
universe itself, the ether

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
is running off the same
code as computer browsers.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So the same code that
regulates your computer browser

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is the same code that regulates
the ether of space itself.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And now this has been
vetted, researched,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and peer-reviewed information.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's now gone widespread.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality
of it is or you

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
want to say the
unreality of it, it

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:84%
appears that we are possibly
living in a simulated universe.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does this mean?

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.288 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take anything
away from people

00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
who believe there's a God.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.187 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because it
proves that there is a creator.

00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:07.561 align:middle line:84%
I think one of
the biggest things

00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that this type of science
and quantum physics

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is also proved that
somebody has created

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
this realm or some
people or entities,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.012 align:middle line:90%
we don't know exactly.

00:23:15.012 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
There is more than one.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:90%
But something has created this.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And what it shows is
that it appears that we

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
are living in a light matrix.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is everything

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that appears to be material
objects within this realm

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:90%
is actually made of light.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, no, you
have quarks and you have this,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:90%
you have that.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.398 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but everything is an
electromagnetic frequency.

00:23:34.398 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And those frequencies
are all light.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what those are.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And just because
you can't see it

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it is not light.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:90%
This is a light universe.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.716 align:middle line:90%
Everything is made of light.

00:23:42.716 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
My body, your body,
this table, everything.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And what it appears to be is
that there's actually maybe

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
potentially a two-dimensional
structure which is actually

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting in this frequency,
which then consciousness takes

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
over and actually makes it
malleable into different things

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that we call matter,
where separation really

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Separation is
really an illusion.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if
the Big Bang happened

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and it came into and formed
itself into its own entities

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to experience
itself subjectively.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
what it's saying.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
But it even goes deeper
than that because it

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:84%
could be that we're living
in nested realities.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So we could be in a
reality within a reality

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
because we ourselves are now
making games that look so real.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a program
called The Sims.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, I saw a
report the other day

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
where they're saying that
these Sims could potentially

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:90%
be conscious within 100 years.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we're capable of making
a simulated universe that

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:84%
has people in it
that are conscious

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like an
experiment for us to watch,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
could we potentially be some
kid's science experiment

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
in an ancestor
universe above us?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And how deep does
this nesting go?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasn't that part of the
theory about the Annunaki

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
creating us is that maybe
we are their simulation?

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.320 align:middle line:84%
That's another part
of the whole thing.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very possible that
we are living in an Annunaki

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:84%
simulated universe, that we're
just nothing more than a very

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:90%
big experiment.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
that we're not real.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
When people hear a
holographic universe,

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:84%
they think, oh, it
means that we're fake.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:90%
No, you're real.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Your experiences are real.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Your kids are real.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Everything that happens is real.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Because your
consciousness is real.

00:25:13.913 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Your consciousness, exactly,
the consciousness is the thing

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that powers everything.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.154 align:middle line:84%
And if you've studied a
double slit experiment, people

00:25:21.154 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
who don't know about it,
where they took the photons

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and shot them through
a little board,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
well, that on the back
wall is where it produced

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
either particles or
when you observed it,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:90%
it produced a wave.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:90%
So is it a particle?

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.561 align:middle line:90%
Is it a wave?

00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:90%
This is where the question is.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is really
dictating what happens here.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And because we're inside
of the actual hologram,

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
we're actually self-immersed
inside on the inside of it

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.897 align:middle line:84%
trying to look out, we'll never
see the edge of the universe.

00:25:42.897 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:90%
We're on the inside looking out.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Somebody from the
outside looking in

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
can see everything from
another higher dimension.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
From this dimension,
we appear to be

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:90%
completely self-immersed in it.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So even when we touch
things, it's an illusion.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
My hand touching this
table is an illusion.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
All it is the
electromagnetic frequencies

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
in my fingers repelling the
electromagnetic frequencies

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
inside of this table.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And if I can phase
shift the frequencies

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic
structure of my hand,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I could pass my hand
right through this table.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So that begs the question,
are other entities

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
in other dimensions that
have the capability of phase

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.075 align:middle line:84%
shifting their
atomic frequencies

00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:15.658 align:middle line:84%
and stepping into
the third dimension?

00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very possible.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, in terms of
the other dimensions that

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
are neighboring, for
example, would that

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.330 align:middle line:84%
be indicated by dark matter and
dark energy, which obviously

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
is the most predominant forms
and forces in the universe?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Dark energy and dark matter
I think are part of this

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.354 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated program because
it's almost the ether energy.

00:26:34.354 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's
in this universe

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been here from
the second that it formed,

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.440 align:middle line:84%
whenever the switch was turned
on, which caused the Big Bang,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.052 align:middle line:84%
or whether we are
in membrane through,

00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:84%
where two membranes
banged together

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and a white hold formed and sent
the energy into this dimension.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.084 align:middle line:84%
But I think the dark
matter and the dark energy,

00:26:50.084 --> 00:26:51.250 align:middle line:90%
which are light, by the way.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that
dark energy or dark matter

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:90%
means darkness.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Dark matter and dark
energy are actually

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
light, electromagnetic
waves that we're

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
calling dark because we
physically can't see it.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:90%
But we know it's there.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But anything that's
a frequency is light.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So these things, this energy is
moving throughout the universe

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.476 align:middle line:84%
and powering it, literally,
like a energy source.

00:27:13.476 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's
multi-dimensional.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.391 align:middle line:84%
But I know that if you had
a capability, in my opinion,

00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:20.599 align:middle line:84%
of capturing it and using
it as negative energy,

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to open up
the wormhole or stable wormhole,

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.756 align:middle line:84%
which might be what
they're working on at CERN.

00:27:25.756 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.226 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, you're saying
we're living in a light matrix.

00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And that obviously goes back to
what the Masons and others have

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.615 align:middle line:84%
talked about, which is this
whole quest for light, right?

00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.036 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think that
we could ultimately harness

00:27:37.036 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and use light in terms of
either transforming the universe

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
around us or basically becoming
creators in our own right?

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that we
all are part co-creators

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
through consciousness.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.414 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
totally creating reality.

00:27:51.414 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
We may collectively
be creating reality.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think that everybody
is creating their own reality

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:90%
tunnel.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that most
people don't realize this.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest thing, the
trick to this whole light matrix

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:90%
is unity.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Once everybody comes together
and realizes that we're all

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
one, we're all connected
and consciousness

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is able to basically almost
collapse only on itself

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and come in as one
force, we may be

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
able to realize
truly what we're in

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and how we can control
it to better ourselves

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.666 align:middle line:90%
and humanity as a whole.

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
now questions coming

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:90%
in from some of our viewers.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:10%
So Sarah from Texas asked a
really interesting question

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:10%
about the dark side of the
moon that basically she's

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:10%
seen hundreds of small
pyramids, according

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:10%
to some of the photographs.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And one of the theories is
that John Lear has pointed out

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:10%
the idea there's a soul machine,
essentially, or the pyramids

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:10%
in some form suck in
all the energy that

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:10%
tries to pass off this planet.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that this is what's
going on as far as is there

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:84%
a matrix that's kind
of keeping souls here

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to keep reincarnating to keep
living through an existence

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and basically for a
set period of time?

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very
interesting concept.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.581 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 100% sure
of that theory.

00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I do know that the Clementine
Mission went and took pictures

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:90%
of the backside of the moon.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I hate to call it the
dark side of the moon

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
dark side of the moon.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.069 align:middle line:84%
That's another term that's kind
of thrown around that tricks

00:29:09.069 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
people into thinking that
one side is always dark

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.910 align:middle line:90%
and one side's not.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.392 align:middle line:84%
The moon rotates
on its own axis.

00:29:13.392 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It's in a tidal lock
orbit with the earth

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:90%
so we only get to see one side.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But on that side of the
moon, the Clementine Mission

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
took a lot of
interesting photos.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of anomalies are
on that side of the moon.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of what appear
to be craters with pyramids

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:90%
inside the craters.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking now dozens
and dozens and dozens of them.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not 100% sure if they
are attached to this thing

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki
talk about, which

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
they talk about taking
the soul of a human being

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and encapsulating it and
keeping it regenerating

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:90%
on this planet as a slave.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that connects
directly with those pyramids

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't really say.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:90%
But I can tell you this.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:10%
I had a meeting with Major Ed
Dames in October of this year,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:10%
where he talked
about a black pyramid

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:10%
on the back side of the
moon that actually is not

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.170 align:middle line:10%
owned by us, that it's
actually functional.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But this black pyramid, black
meaning the color black,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.676 align:middle line:84%
actually there was a nuclear
experiment in the desert

00:30:08.676 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in Mesopotamia or
somewhere in the Middle East.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was a failed.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
bury it deep enough.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And he claimed that this black
pyramid disappeared from there,

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:84%
reappeared over this
failed nuclear experiment,

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.235 align:middle line:84%
and sucked up the radiation
and then disappeared from it

00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:26.562 align:middle line:84%
and went back to the
back side of the moon.

00:30:26.562 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a claim
obviously that he's made.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's very interesting that
she says maybe it has something

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:90%
with absorbing the souls.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Annunaki
do talk about that.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know if there's
a direct correlation with that

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.982 align:middle line:84%
and the anomalies on the
backside of the moon.

00:30:39.982 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.618 align:middle line:10%
But the point is that we
are reincarnating here

00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:10%
for a certain period of time.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.630 align:middle line:10%
And is there any
purpose, in your mind,

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:10%
towards what humans are meant
to achieve while they're

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:10%
in this incarnation process?

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there is
different levels.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.058 align:middle line:84%
And I think certain
people actually

00:30:54.058 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:84%
have volunteered to come
here to help and assist

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
with mankind's ascension
to a higher dimension

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
because some have broke free
and realized what's going on

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.536 align:middle line:84%
and have come back,
try to assist and aid.

00:31:04.536 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I Call them Djedi's, D-J-E-D-I.
And then we have some people

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.250 align:middle line:84%
here that are just reincarnating
over and over again

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and don't really
realize what's going on.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
for this assist

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and looking for this help and
those people are coming to us

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and coming to shows
like this and coming

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
to Gaia and other places and
seeking knowledge and truth,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to find ways to
really consciously transform

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.607 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's also
soulless avatars that

00:31:30.607 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
actual matrix program,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in my personal opinion,
that are here to try

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.031 align:middle line:90%
to keep everybody boxed in.

00:31:36.031 --> 00:31:38.405 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a combination
of a lot of things going on

00:31:38.405 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:31:40.104 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating interview.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for your time,
Billy, really appreciate it.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Billy Carson.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
today, but I really urge you
to check out his research

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:84%
at Forbidden Knowledge on
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and Tumblr.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.146 align:middle line:84%
along the buzzsaw's edge,
requires constant reassessment.

00:32:01.146 --> 00:32:02.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:90%
And you are the revolution.
