00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The debate about who
wrote Shakespeare rages on.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.430 align:middle line:90%
But could it have been a woman?

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the buzzsaw.

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:19.846 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Sean Stone,
and joining me today

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
is Joseph Atwill, who
has studied extensively

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the origins of Christianity,
including the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
After publishing his bestselling
first book, "Caesar's Messiah,"

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:84%
he released a followup in 2014
called "Shakespeare's Secret

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Messiah," which alleges that
the author of the Shakespeare

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:84%
material may have actually
been the Dark Lady, Amelia

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Bassano, who,
according to Atwill,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
was aware of the Roman
origins of Christianity

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and revealed this
knowledge covertly

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
through the
Shakespeare material.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So Joseph, I want to start
by basically asking you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.919 align:middle line:84%
about how you came
across Amelia Bassano

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
as a potential candidate,
because obviously we've

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
heard throughout the years of
everyone from Francis Bacon

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to DeVere to Shakespeare
himself being the real author,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.789 align:middle line:84%
but this notion of Amelia
Bassano is quite novel.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
She had been
completely overlooked.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't aware of
anyone else that had ever

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
suggested that she could
have been the author, which

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in hindsight is
actually preposterous,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because if you actually
do a mapping of the data,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:84%
the actual knowledge that
the author of Shakespeare

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:84%
possessed, which has been done
now by other scholars, Bassano,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Amelia Bassano stands out as
by far and away the strongest

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
candidate, because she had
all of the arcane aspects.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:84%
She had a connection
into the theater.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:90%
She knew Italian.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And she was able
to make Hebrew puns

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%
because her family was Jewish.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't basically
discover Amelia Bassano

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and then try to fit her into
the Shakespearean literature.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
What happened was is I
read "Titus Andronicus,"

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:90%
the Shakespearean play.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
that that play was

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in fact showing an
awareness of the typology,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.635 align:middle line:84%
the Flavian typology
that I presented

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in "Caesar's Messiah."

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when I read the
other Shakespearean plays,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I could see that in fact
that awareness of the Flavian

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.637 align:middle line:90%
typology was everywhere.

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of the
plays were simply

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
based upon it completely,
like "Titus Andronicus."

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But "Titus Andronicus"
is very special,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because the title "Titus
Andronicus," what drew me to it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that the
name of the main character

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
is Titus and the person
who basically produces

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
the Gospels is Titus Flavius.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But the second character's--
the second name is what really

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:84%
attracted me, Andronicus,
because Andronicus was one

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of the very few people that
had ever sacked the temple

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:90%
of Jerusalem.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in 2
Maccabees, the story

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of his sacking-- Andronicus
sacking the temple of Jerusalem

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and stealing artifacts from it.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So the author had joined
these two individuals

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
into this character, Titus
Andronicus, which clearly

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be
suggesting something

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:84%
about the destruction of
the temple of Jerusalem,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
which was a military
victory of Titus Flavius.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that was what
drew me to the play.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
When I read the play, I
could see very obviously

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that this was reversing the
typology, the bitter humor

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that's found in the Gospels,
which on a broad scale

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
basically is just lampooning
the Jewish messianic family

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:90%
for eating the Messiah.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
sad but honest truth

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
about the dark joke
inside of the Gospels.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And in Titus Andronicus,
this is reversed

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and it is the Gentile
royal families that

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:90%
end up eating their own flesh.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But there are many,
many other elements

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that would suggest a
connection, none of which

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
had been seen by scholarship.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that just froze me

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
in place, which I don't
want to be long-winded,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
but I just need this
one example of support.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.864 align:middle line:84%
I was reading along and
trying to understand the play.

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the very
beginning, there's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
a passage where the
brother of Titus

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is said to be someone
who kills flies.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And it says it doesn't
become the brother of Titus

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to be a killer of flies.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And the author repeats the
concept, the brother of Titus

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that kills flies.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
classically educated,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you know that Titus Flavius'
real brother Domitian

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
was famous for killing flies.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So I knew at that
point, wait a second.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a cryptic
representation of the Flavians.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that the author
was aware of the humor

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:90%
in the Gospels.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that obviously
indicates precisely

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.954 align:middle line:84%
a certain classical education,
perhaps Hebrew origin.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But who is Amelia
Bassano herself?

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.784 align:middle line:84%
Well, from there, I tried
to determine who was

00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
the author of this material.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Who could have wrote a Jewish
response to the Roman gospels,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And in England at
that time, there

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.427 align:middle line:84%
were very few people
that could have.

00:05:04.427 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
There were very few.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And the only real writer
was Amelia Bassano.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Amelia Bassano was the
daughter of a family

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that had come from
Italy, from the region

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
that the Italian
plays are set, Verona,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
"Romeo and Juliet," "The
Merchant of Venice."

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So the family had
come from there.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Henry VIII had brought the
Bassanos, five brothers,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to England to help
with his court music.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
They were musicians and
they also made instruments.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:90%
So they were converso.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The family had been
originally Jewish.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
It was illegal to
practice Judaism

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and so they had converted
ostensibly to Christianity.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, her father had
taken the name Baptista,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
just to make sure
everyone knew that he had

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%
gone through the experience.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:90%
So she was their daughter.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
She was an extraordinary
language expert.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:90%
She was a language tutor.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.249 align:middle line:84%
So she had from her family
the background in Italian.

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
As a language tutor, she
would have been familiar

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:90%
with Latin, French.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.672 align:middle line:84%
And because the family
clearly understood Hebrew

00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, that
was where the Hebrew

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
puns that I discovered
in Shakespeare came from.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
She had direct connections
into the theater.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The individual that
she was the mistress of

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:90%
owned the Globe Theatre.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you start--
when I started

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
looking at this individual
and started just

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
plugging in her
life into the plays,

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly I could
see, wait a second.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:90%
She's the author.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they both,
both Shakespeare

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
in the sonnets
and Amelia Bassano

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
in her play "Salve Deus"--
because Amelia Bassano was

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.495 align:middle line:84%
the first woman to ever actually
copyright a work of literature.

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:90%
She's the very first.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so she copyrighted
a poem called

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
"Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum,"
"Hail God, King of the Jews."

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what kind
of an expression?

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And so in the play,
there is a pun on Will.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:84%
She makes this pun
on the name Will.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the sonnet,
she makes a pun

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.579 align:middle line:90%
that actually is very parallel.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And see, this was when
I knew I was dealing

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
with the author of Shakespeare,
because in addition

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to all these other elements that
are almost unique, when you add

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to that the idea that
they're both putting

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
on Will in the same way,
then of course-- actually,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:90%
she's making an expression.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.631 align:middle line:84%
She's actually
telling us that, look,

00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:20.977 align:middle line:90%
I produced the literature.

00:07:20.977 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she
was the only author.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I think she had help.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
There were individuals
around her.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.582 align:middle line:84%
And you can say this in
the preface to the folio,

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
people that were involved,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.127 align:middle line:90%
but she was the primary author.

00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>I can understand at
the time, for example,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.154 align:middle line:84%
that if it wasn't because she
was a woman that she might want

00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:39.695 align:middle line:84%
to mask her identity,
perhaps because

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of the political
ramifications of the work

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.524 align:middle line:84%
and the fact of her family
being of Jewish origin,

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
do you think that would
be the main reason she

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:90%
would want to mask it?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Or was there something
else that was implied?

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, why she would
mask the authorship?

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>The comedy they're
engaging in is

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
a reversing of what the
Flavians did to the Jews.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to kind of maybe
go further back into her life

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
than we can in
this time, but she

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
had many reasons to
be personally engaged

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
against the divine
right of kings

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Catholic and then the
Protestant kings maintained.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they took this
right from the Gospels.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So she wanted to write
a response to that.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the key element
of the Gospels

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
crypto-Gentile writing.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
It purports to be written
by Jews about a Jew.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you place the writing
inside of the Flavian court

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and you look at this
character, the Son

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.604 align:middle line:84%
of Man, that the
Gospels supposedly

00:08:39.604 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
are predicting,
what they're doing

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
is the Gentiles are
organizing Jewish literature

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to their way of wanting the
political structure to exist.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they're also
very subtly putting

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
into the Messianic
lineage, the lineage that

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:90%
produces the kings, a Gentile.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So what Bassano does
is this very skillful

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
crafting to reverse it,
whereby in "Titus Andronicus"

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
you have a character named
Shakespeare writing it.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, even the name Shakespeare
is in fact in this comic vein.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
On the folio, the name is
given Will Shake hyphen Speare.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
"Will shake spear."

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a martial declaration
that the real author is leaving

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:90%
for us about this character.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have a purported Gentile
writing about the Gentile

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
nobility cannibalizing
themselves.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And so by doing that, by
having a fictional Gentile,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Amelia Bassano was able to
make a complete and perfect

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:90%
literary reversal.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Really what's inspiring her is
the fact that she knew bloody

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
well that the Gospels
were eventually

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be understood, and
that the Flavians had written it

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of comic
pie in the face

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
they were going to deliver
to the Jews in the future.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
This was their hope.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:90%
They had that much hatred.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
She wants to do a
reversal of that

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and to say, look, you think
you're the only ones who

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
can do this kind of foolery?

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that the whole literature
of Shakespeare, sorry to say,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a comic pie in
the face to the Gentiles

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
that this organization produced
so that later in the future,

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
when the interpretive
framework would be resolved

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Flavians would have
their moment of glory, finally

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:90%
here we are.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:90%
We wrote the Gospels.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:90%
See us as geniuses.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.474 align:middle line:84%
Well, this literature would
stand there as a response.

00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>But she wasn't
alone, obviously,

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking
about a collaboration.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.414 align:middle line:84%
>>So who was the network of
people that are collaborating

00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and what is-- and obviously,
they're coming not necessarily

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
from the same background as
her, or Christoper Marlowe,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>I think actually
that they would

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
have had this understanding.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Marlowe is central

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:90%
to it, understanding Marlowe.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
"Shakespeare's Secret Messiah,"

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I do an analysis of
"The Jew of Malta."

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And I show that Christopher
Marlowe understood the Flavian

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
typology.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
He actually has probably
the clearest declaration

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
of who wrote the Gospels in
"The Jew of Malta," where

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.036 align:middle line:84%
he has a character who
is a Jew say, you know,

00:11:12.036 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
no one ever called us
Christians until Titus

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.702 align:middle line:90%
and Vespasian conquered us.

00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So they have this very
clear declaration.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, he
has many, many others,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:90%
the kind of more cryptic thing.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
But Marlowe, at least
according to the Shakespearean

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
literature, had a very
close relationship

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
with Amelia Bassano.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
His real death is
actually recorded.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
It's recorded symbolically in
"The Merry Maids of Windsor."

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And what she does is
she writes a story

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
about the keeper of legal
records, who have an exchange

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and conversation.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.847 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a greyhound
that was outrun on the Cotsall.

00:11:51.847 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And the greyhound for
some reason, they say,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't confess.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, Marlowe is
compared to a greyhound.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:90%
He had kind of blondish hair.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
He was executed on the
Cotsall-- that's May first.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And the statement, well,
he wouldn't confess,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.982 align:middle line:84%
that means that the privy
council-- and the story

00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
then transitions
into a description

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
of the privy council, which was
this infamous star chamber that

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
would try to protect the
divine right of kings

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
against any heresy-- that
Marlowe had been taken

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.891 align:middle line:84%
and executed and refused
to confess to give up

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the names of the individuals
that he was working with.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And she recorded this
fact typologically.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And then this is completely
resolved by immediately

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.087 align:middle line:84%
after that, she goes
into a poem of Marlowe.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a Shakespearean play.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:84%
She starts quoting
from a poem of Marlowe.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But she transmogrifies
it, and she

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
starts to plug in--
after Marlowe's preface,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
she plugs in lines
from Psalm 137.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Psalms 137 is the
most ferocious psalm

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
of describing Jewish
vengeance in the Bible.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
This then becomes attached
to Marlowe's poetry.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So even though this
is symbolic, this

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
was how she was able to
represent the true history.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The history that we're given
about this bill of fare

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
she actually lampoons.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get into
too much of the symbolism.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
People can read the book if
they want to have this decoded.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.295 align:middle line:84%
So Marlowe had been
very close to her.

00:13:21.295 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that
they were lovers.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he was killed, this
was actually the inspiration.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:84%
This was what drove
her so intensely.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that Marlowe
was involved in it

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
shows that there
was a larger group.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.692 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about
things, for example,

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
like the School of the Night.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
People make
conjectures about this.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.071 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
Thomas Harriot, who's

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
a friend of Marlowe,
Walter Raleigh.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
group-- and I'm

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
certain of it-- they actually
knew the real origins

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is
an actual letter

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
which states that
Marlowe has written

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
a book which shows that the
Gospels were the work of a man.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And this was two weeks
before he was killed.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, that book has
never been uncovered.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But I can guarantee
you it would basically

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
have been Caesar's
Messiah," because you

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.137 align:middle line:84%
look at "The Jew of Malta," you
can see he knows the typology.

00:14:18.137 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So it would have been
"Caesar's Messiah, except it

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:90%
would have been well written.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But it had never
been discovered.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It's missing.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:90%
But the letter does exist.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's enough data
so you can actually

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
put all of these
pieces together,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that
she was at that time

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:90%
living under threat of death.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Two of her cousins
had been caught

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
worshipping in a kind
of a set up synagogue,

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and these individuals
were racked.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So Judaism had been
prohibited in Britain.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Conversos were coming
into Britain at this time,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.696 align:middle line:90%
but they couldn't practice.

00:14:58.696 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, they were being expelled
from Spain, for example.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.364 align:middle line:84%
So during this era, when there
was so much tension concerning

00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the divine right of
kings, of holding up

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Christianity as real--

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>Especially you would think
with Elizabeth, basically,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
because she's comin--
basically she's being

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:90%
called a heretic on top of it.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.778 align:middle line:84%
>>So she really
has to maintain a--

00:15:17.778 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>High-level paranoia.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the literature
that was permitted, basically.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
They had to write
it symbolically.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't be public.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think they also
did want to do it

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
as a historical--
something that would exist

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
in history in the
future, because they

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:90%
wanted to mimic the Gospels.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>>So talk about-- you mentioned
the School of the Night.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Talk about what
that organization was,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
who were the main
members, and what it

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:90%
seems to have been focusing on.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, the odd thing about
the School of the Night

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is that there really isn't
any evidence of his existence.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It comes from conjecture of a
line in "Love's Labour's Lost"

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
which is describing
things that are black.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Black is the hue of
dungeons and a series

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:90%
of things that are dark.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the color
of the School of Night.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is being
given-- the statement's

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
being given by the King of
Navarre, who is a Gentile king.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the author is
engaging in irony here,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
because in the
Shakespearean literature,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
black is the color
actually of God.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Amelia Bassano was dark-skinned.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%
She was known as The Moor.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:90%
That was her nickname.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Her family had the Morus
tree as its family kind

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
of crest, the moor-tree, which
of course then the moor-tree is

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:84%
planted supposedly outside
the Stratfordian home

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Shakespeare character.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But there is an actual document
where one of her uncles

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is arrested and he is described
as a little black man.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So when the author is having the
King of Navarre talk about all

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:84%
of these things that are
black, what really is happening

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is that he doesn't
understand it,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:84%
but these are Satan in the
Shakespearean literature

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
is actually referencing the
Gospel's use of the term.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospels, Jesus is
exorcising individuals

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that have a rebellious spirit.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>These are Jewish
freedom fighters.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Zealots.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>Zealots.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
They are being defined as
being possessed by a demon.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:90%
And what is the demon?

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It is non-obedience,
rebellion from Rome.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So Amelia Bassano is continuing
this genre, basically.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:90%
But she's reversing it.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:90%
So here, dark is good, you see.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
This is really what
she's saying is

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
that she's a
dark-skinned individual

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and has a Jewish background.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And the fair is
what it is basically

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:90%
threatening and illegitimate.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
The Flavians, who
produced the Gospel,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
the word "flavian"
in Latin means blond.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the background
of Shakespeare.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:90%
This is what--

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>I see.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But the School of the Night,
you say it's conjecture,

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:90%
so what is it?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>Yeah, well, it's an
expression that what she's doing

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
is she's saying that the School
of the Night-- and I actually

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:90%
think it did exist.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:12.991 align:middle line:84%
She's actually--
what she's referring

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to is the school,
the group that she

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
was involved with that
understood the Flavian

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:90%
typology.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And they had to exist
basically in silence.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know Marlowe
was inside the school.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, Bassano.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The other individuals
we can only guess at,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.828 align:middle line:90%
because there's no documents.

00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But I would presume that
Marlowe's friend Harriot

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.115 align:middle line:84%
and William Raleigh--
and this is because--

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:38.915 align:middle line:90%
>>Walter.

00:18:38.915 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>Walter Raleigh.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
This is because they are
associated with atheism.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Atheism was basically
the-- that was

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:84%
what the imperial
court, the royal court

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
was opposed to, because
atheism equaled no belief

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
in the divine right of kings.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
That was the political
structure they stood on.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So the fact the school
is called atheistical

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
means that basically they
were looking at something that

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:90%
would disprove the Gospels.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>So Shakespeare
himself was not part

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:90%
of the School of the Night.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.448 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's his
role ultimately?

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And why is he the
one that's chosen

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.261 align:middle line:84%
to be the name or the front
man for this collaboration?

00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, the individual
that-- as far as anyone

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.772 align:middle line:84%
can tell, because there's so
little evidence of this guy.

00:19:19.772 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't have
the name Shakespeare.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.896 align:middle line:84%
That's the pun that I mentioned
earlier, Will Shakespeare.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
They turned his name into
this double entendre.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.899 align:middle line:84%
But Shagspere would
have had nothing

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
literature whatsoever.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact-- and this
is very easy to see--

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
the historical character
had a father and a daughter.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Both of them signed on to
census forms at some point.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Those are still in existence.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They signed with
the X, meaning they

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:90%
were completely illiterate.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So the father signs
his name with the X.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
The daughter signs
her name with the X.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The author of the
Shakespearean literature

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
had a vocabulary of 23,000
words and expressions.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the largest ever
recorded in literature.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
The next largest is Milton,
and I think it's 10,000.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Shakespearean
author had a vocabulary

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that was simply superhuman
and could not ever

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:84%
possibly have anything to
do with the individual who

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
occurred with both
generations on either side

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:90%
being illiterate.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So this individual
was just used--

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>He was notoriously
called-- what was

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:90%
it-- little Latin, less Greek.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.688 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
in the preface,

00:20:27.688 --> 00:20:30.665 align:middle line:84%
they say he never
blotted a line.

00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:90%
I wish he'd blotted 1,000.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is humor.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:84%
He never blotted a line
because he never wrote a line.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:39.249 align:middle line:84%
You see, the entire premise,
once you understand it,

00:20:39.249 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:84%
you can see they're just
rolling on the ground laughing

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:90%
at this character.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is that
women weren't permitted

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
into the theater at this
point, so Amelia Bassano

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.410 align:middle line:84%
would have needed to have
some front for her plays

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.557 align:middle line:90%
under any circumstances.

00:20:54.557 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it is
so potentially politically

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
explosive, I actually think that
they got the Shagspere person

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
because he had very
low level of intellect.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.114 align:middle line:84%
And this was what made him
attractive, because they knew

00:21:07.114 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%
he was just completely safe.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:90%
But this is a conjecture.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's what I suspect
from the illiteracy of both

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:90%
of the generations.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>But do you think that--
again, the actual purpose

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
behind the School of the
Night, the idea of trying

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
to do potentially even just
show how the Gospels were

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.762 align:middle line:84%
a concoction of the hierarchy
at the time, the Roman Empire

00:21:27.762 --> 00:21:29.595 align:middle line:84%
and how it still existed
to that present day

00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and the divine
right of kings, do

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:84%
you think that these concepts
actually were understood

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
by the public, or do you think
it was all lost in translation?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>There is no recording
of the documents

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:90%
getting into the public domain.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Marlowe-- the only one
we have is the letter

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:90%
that refers to Marlowe's book.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And since that was
seized and destroyed,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:90%
then there just aren't any.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So the group around
Shakespeare, what

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
exactly were their motivations,
because there would have been

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
reasons to bring out this
information in other ways?

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:90%
You can only conjecture.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.417 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know why they
wouldn't have done that.

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>Certainly, they were
an educated audience,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so you can imagine-- I mean,
not the entire audience.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But people who were educated
would have understood allusions

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, in "Macbeth"
when Lady Macbeth is saying,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:84%
out, damn spot, and he
can't get the stain out

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and it reminds us of
Pontius Pilate trying

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
to wash the blood away, right?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.276 align:middle line:84%
>>You would think that
that would be something

00:22:31.276 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that anyone who watches
Macbeth would understand,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that the whole-- there's
this period in the play that

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
is off the stage.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the timing of it, it
takes a strange length of time,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.406 align:middle line:84%
judging by the position
of the sun and the night.

00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are wondering,
why does it take so long?

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just a cryptic
way of saying they crucified.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They actually use the
king, the real king

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that Macbeth is killing as
a type, a piece of typology.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And so now when Macbeth
says that the blood is a sea

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:84%
incarnadine, the fancy
Latin word for blood,

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.202 align:middle line:84%
and then Lady Macbeth can't
get the blood off of her hands,

00:23:12.202 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
yeah, what they're
doing is they're

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
saying that where Pontius Pilate
was able to wash his hands,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that was fiction.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:84%
What we're creating is a
character that really has

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the guilt of this act
and cannot get rid of it.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
wonder, well, what

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:84%
was the actual
circumstances around her?

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible that
the group was so small,

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
had so few individuals,
that they really

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a way to or
any audience to go to.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
All they had was the plays
that they could put on.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had to be very
cryptic and symbolic,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
otherwise the star chamber
which analyzed plays

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:84%
for political content
would have picked it up.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%
So this is what we have.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately we
have "Titus Andronicus"

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and a number of
the plays that are

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:84%
essentially complete
no-brainers as far

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as seeing the relationship
between the typology

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.862 align:middle line:84%
and the Shakespearean
literature.

00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Which ones in
particular would you say?

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, "Hamlet" and "Macbeth."

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I think "The Tempest" is very,
very simple to understand.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I've written analysis of that
which is not in Shakespeare's

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:90%
"Secret Messiah."

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But the first play that
everyone needs to read

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
is simply "Titus Andronicus,"
because for example, you'll

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
see things like
the character Aaron

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
taking his child
down from the cross.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
The child survives
a crucifixion.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Aaron begs the Gentiles to let
this child down from a cross.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And then that child
ends up just very

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.402 align:middle line:84%
subtly placed within the royal
family at the end of the play.

00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You just suddenly have-- there's
a little aside saying, oh,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and by the way, there he is.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:90%
The child of Aaron is with us.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you compare--
now, once you start

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing all of the
Flavian connections

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and then recognize that the
last supper is represented

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:84%
with Titus giving food
to the Gentile nobility,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:84%
well, now you see the family
of Aaron, because remember,

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Aaron is the family that the
Flavians inserted their Roman

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Christ into.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The Hasmoneans, family of
Aaron or a tribe of Aaron,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.387 align:middle line:84%
would have been
the ruling family.

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
Maccabees come from.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Shakespearean
author names the character

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Aaron.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have a perfect symmetry,
whereas in the Gospels

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
they insert the Gentile
into the family of Aaron,

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
the royal family.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.112 align:middle line:90%
Here, it is just the reverse.

00:25:38.112 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
The family of Aaron inserts--

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>Jesus is the Roman insertion
to the line of David.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But here you have-- and
in fact, one question

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that people have asked
is that Julie Taymor, who

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
produced Titus
Andronicus the movie,

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:84%
she takes the ending of
the play and changes it.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And she has maybe a
four-minute vignette of one

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Gentiles with blond
hair holding the child of Aaron

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and walking into a sun.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So people have
suggested to me that she

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
has to understand
the occulted meaning.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried to contact her,
but she hasn't got back to me.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Maybe she'll talk to you.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, an important point
is that in this time period

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Shakespeare's
literature, they

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
are rewriting the Bible, calling
it the King James Bible, right?

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>And Francis Bacon
is obviously very

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
much in charge of
that new Bible that's

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:84%
going to perpetuate the
Christ myth into English.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
evidence that Bassano

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.134 align:middle line:84%
would have been
involved in that,

00:26:39.134 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
or is any real correlation
between the Shakespeare project

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of
this King James Bible?

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>There's really a
very witty insertion

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
by the Shakespearean crew
into the King James Bible.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.077 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Bassanos would
have at least been involved

00:26:55.077 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
on the periphery,
because at this time

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.701 align:middle line:84%
there were very few people
who understood Hebrew,

00:26:58.701 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
so they naturally would
have been brought in.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
That group, that
family would have

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
been brought in to some extent
to help with the Old Testament.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But in Psalm 46, 46 words from
the top, if you count down,

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:90%
you have the word "shake."

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the bottom
and count up 46 words,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:90%
you have the word "spear."

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's very suspicious.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But the psalm that
it's inserted into

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
is actually a psalm
that describes basically

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
how Jews that are
wandering in the world

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
need to keep their
god to themselves

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:90%
as a source of strength.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And so once Bassano
has been outed

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
as the author of the
Shakespearean literature,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
this becomes-- I mean,
people have contested it.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
They know the 46 counting
system is correct.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But they go, well,
it's just an accident.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.135 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you have the
Bassano family involved

00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
in the production
of Shakespeare,

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're probably involved in
the translation of the Hebrew,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:84%
then the idea this is
circumstance falls.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And what they're doing is
they're just writing the code

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
right in so that you can
see it in the future,

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that we were actually there.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:90%
We understood the Bible.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:90%
We understood the New Testament.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>You're saying she was outed.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But why was there never-- why
did no one ever address this?

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Either in her life or
shortly thereafter,

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
no one ever addressed
the idea that, well,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare really couldn't
have written these plays.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>The character from Avon,
why she didn't do it?

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Why wasn't he out
earlier, at the time

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.041 align:middle line:90%
or right after his death?

00:28:28.041 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's because this
was just very cleverly done

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
create the fiction.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought
the folio out,

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
it was long enough
after the fact

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:84%
from when the plays
had first been produced

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and in circulation that no one
really would have vetted it.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
There was suspicions about
Shakespeare's authorship

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:90%
very early on.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But you see, at that time,
literary criticism was really

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:90%
almost a nonexistent form.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:84%
People could criticize
the plays or have

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:58.985 align:middle line:90%
an opinion about the plays.

00:28:58.985 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of doing
author scholarship,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
it just didn't occur.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.436 align:middle line:84%
So we were given a history of
a character that could not have

00:29:08.436 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:90%
possibly written the plays.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.717 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the
intellectual tools.

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:90%
But no one really questioned it.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.599 align:middle line:84%
And then that's
why over time then

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:18.140 align:middle line:84%
you started having, well, it
was Bacon; well, it was Marlowe;

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.764 align:middle line:90%
well, it was the Earl of Oxford.

00:29:19.764 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:84%
They started
having-- in fact, now

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:90%
there's probably 15 candidates.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It all stems from the fact that
there wasn't good authorship

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:90%
scholarship at that time.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've
got this crazy world

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:84%
where all these people
are being suggested.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that Amelia
Bassano is just

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
so strong on the historical
connections into the plays

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that when "Titus Andronicus"--
when this becomes widely

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
understood, I just think that
she'll become shortly seen

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
as certainly the primary
candidate for the authorship.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm reminded of Cocteau.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
He once said that he
prefers myth to history,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
because history starts off
as real but ends up as myth.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And myth starts off as
fake but ends up as real.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.299 align:middle line:84%
>>And how do people
decipher the false histories

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and the mythologies
that have been created?

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>You know, you
don't have a chance

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:84%
if you don't understand the
primer that the Romans left us.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We're very fortunate
they did this.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the very
beginning of the Gospels.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a short passage.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:84%
It takes probably
less than a half hour.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But the entire
pre-ministry of Jesus,

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:84%
from the point where his
father Joseph has a dream

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and decides to go to Egypt
to the point where Jesus

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
then comes back from Egypt and
goes out into the wilderness

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and has these temptations
with the devil,

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that structure of events all
comes from the Old Testament.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.064 align:middle line:84%
Every single story
can be shown to have

00:30:47.064 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:90%
come from the Old Testament.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
What you have is
concepts, names, locations

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:90%
occurring in the same sequence.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>That's typology.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>That's typology.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you
understand typology,

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
you understand the
language of the oligarchs.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:84%
The oligarchs cannot-- and even
hidden authorship positions,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:84%
like Amelia Bassano, they
cannot speak publicly.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We live today in
the United States.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
There was quite
a bit of freedom,

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and so we have this
habit of speaking openly.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But this wasn't the
case for the oligarchs.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
They were never able
to speak openly,

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:84%
because all of the
stories they're giving,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Christianity
particularly, is basically

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:90%
weaponized anthropology.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So they can't give the real
story of the first century.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
They give you the
Gospels instead.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
But they are vain.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
They have a vanity that's
almost unimaginable.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.565 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I would say
the oligarchs still

00:31:38.565 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
don't speak publicly, because
then if they speak publicly,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.990 align:middle line:84%
they reveal themselves
and they reveal the games,

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:84%
as you say the
weaponization that's

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:90%
taking place or the intention.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They have to only
do it through media,

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.010 align:middle line:84%
through mythology
and perpetuation

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of these narratives, right?

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Exactly right.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And so they do from time
to time speak publicly.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, they
speak typologically.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say,
look, to defend yourself,

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the citizen has
to just understand

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.390 align:middle line:90%
this very small structure.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
primer on typology.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And this method of
talking about one thing

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
but you're actually obliquely
referencing another subject,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
this is how the
oligarchs communicate.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And I've shown examples of it.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, in JD Salinger
in Catcher in the Rye

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you get all kinds of--
once you understand

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:84%
how the typology is structured,
you can really make sense out

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of how legacy is developed
by the oligarchs.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just hope
that every citizen in order

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to defend themselves simply
look at that very short passage

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of Matthew and
understand it, understand how

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
the author has woven into
this fabulous tale-- you think

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
of the story of Jesus,
Joseph has the dreams

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and heads down to Egypt.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, where does that come from?

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.835 align:middle line:84%
The Joseph who dreamed
dreams and went to Egypt,

00:32:59.835 --> 00:33:01.960 align:middle line:84%
this is the Joseph from
the Old Testament, you see.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.876 align:middle line:84%
The author, right off
the bat he's telling you

00:33:03.876 --> 00:33:05.780 align:middle line:84%
this is-- and he
has a point, though,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
because what he's saying is
this character I'm developing

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:90%
is divine.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:84%
There is a divine
pattern over his life

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:90%
that links him backwards.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's also vanity, because
the author knows perfectly well

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that sophisticated people
are going to realize,

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.230 align:middle line:84%
hey, this whole story
of Jesus is fake.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:90%
So what's the point?

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It's vanity.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so that would be
how we can defend ourselves.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
understanding typology.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The second way is we
have to understand

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:90%
neurolinguistic programming.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a different subject,
but they understand--

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:84%
they study the mind and they
learn how to code influence

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:90%
into it, propaganda.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.930 align:middle line:90%
They know this very, very well.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So we need to know
typology and we need to--

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and then the last thing would
be I would say the fallacies.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
so much sophistry.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The arguments are ludicrous if
you have a training in logic.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:90%
You can see, wait a second.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:84%
He's just lying to me
or it's a fake argument.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But people are not trained
to notice the fallacies.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So study the fallacies,
study typology,

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and know a little bit about
neurolinguistic programming

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.724 align:middle line:84%
and believe me, you'll be
able to defend yourself.

00:34:16.724 --> 00:34:17.667 align:middle line:90%
>>That sounds good.

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:19.250 align:middle line:84%

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:90%
