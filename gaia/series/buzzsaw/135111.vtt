>>SEAN STONE Are you
being mind controlled?

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:03.587 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:06.465 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.262 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.895 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.897 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.065 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.317 align:middle line:84%
And joining me today
is Dr. John Hall.

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle line:84%
He is a medical doctor
from San Antonio, Texas,

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.155 align:middle line:84%
and the author of "Satellite
Terrorism in America."

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.908 align:middle line:84%
His new book is "Guinea Pigs--
Technologies of Control."

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.119 align:middle line:84%
He is also an active member of
the Mind Science Foundation,

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.413 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the study
of human consciousness.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.749 align:middle line:84%
And he sits on the medical
committee of the human rights

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
organization Freedom From Covert
Harassment and Surveillance.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.838 align:middle line:84%
So today we pick his brain
on the "eye in the sky."

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start by asking
you about what does it mean

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.386 align:middle line:90%
to be a targeted individual?

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:54.805 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. JOHN HALL: There is a
subset of the population right

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:58.433 align:middle line:84%
now that are complaining of
targeting, specifically being

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:02.938 align:middle line:84%
followed everywhere they go,
on to the extent of hearing

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.358 align:middle line:84%
voices, suffering from
directed energy attacks--

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:08.694 align:middle line:84%
really weird happenings
in their life that

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:12.531 align:middle line:84%
are unexplainable by
any other normal means.

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.284 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be experimentation
probably at its root.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:84%
So, well, I want to get into
the government history of it.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.207 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about
your personal history,

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.001 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost,
because you have

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.252 align:middle line:90%
personal experience with this.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.712 align:middle line:84%
And that's what,
I believe, got you

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:28.297 align:middle line:90%
interested in the subject, no?

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:29.673 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: That's exactly it.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:33.301 align:middle line:84%
I had a ex-fiance that
came to me voicing some

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:90%
of these really odd phenomena.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.973 align:middle line:90%
No history of mental illness.

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:40.392 align:middle line:84%
No history of drug
use or alcohol use.

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So I had no reason
not to believe

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.228 align:middle line:90%
that something was going on.

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.981 align:middle line:84%
She was being followed by
people she didn't know.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.651 align:middle line:84%
Was hearing voices around her
describing her whereabouts

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.029 align:middle line:90%
and in her locations.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.906 align:middle line:84%
So she was scared to
go to anybody else.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.908 align:middle line:84%
She trusted me,
so she came to me.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And we counter-surveilled her.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.912 align:middle line:84%
I actually set up
counter-surveillance measures,

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.497 align:middle line:84%
including people
following her around

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.249 align:middle line:90%
to see who was following her.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, she was
being followed around

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.545 align:middle line:84%
by a group of private
investigators, a company that

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:84%
was owned and operated
by a former FBI agent.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.678 align:middle line:84%
They had rented condominiums
on either side of her,

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:20.432 align:middle line:84%
were drugging her food
and water with Rohypnol,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.517 align:middle line:84%
committing sexual
assaults-- essentially

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:26.188 align:middle line:84%
kind of using her
as a sex slave.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.066 align:middle line:84%
We did get all the information
on the plate numbers,

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
information on the entity that
was doing the following-- doing

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.028 align:middle line:90%
the stalking.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:33.862 align:middle line:90%
Went to the police.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:37.074 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the Texas
State laws on stalking

00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:38.575 align:middle line:90%
were not that great.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.702 align:middle line:84%
You had to prove bodily
injury before you

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:90%
could get a restraining order.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.665 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, if you're former
FBI or if you're a licensed PI,

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
there was almost
nothing you could do.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.462 align:middle line:84%
A combination of our case
and another case where

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.715 align:middle line:84%
a victim actually was
murdered by her stalker

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:57.344 align:middle line:84%
were what got the stalking
laws in Texas changed

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.679 align:middle line:84%
to where now if you notice
the same person following you

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
twice, you can actually get a
restraining order against them.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.519 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, since I
seemed to-- we couldn't

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.437 align:middle line:84%
get any help from
law enforcement,

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.607 align:middle line:84%
decided to basically write the
story of my first book, "A New

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.735 align:middle line:84%
Breed-- Satellite
Terrorism in America,"

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.654 align:middle line:84%
basically to expose
that it's going on.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:18.865 align:middle line:84%
Well, unbeknownst to me,
once I did a couple of radio

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.493 align:middle line:84%
shows introducing the
book, was bombarded

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.745 align:middle line:84%
with thousands and
thousands of emails

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:26.748 align:middle line:84%
of people describing the
exact type of stalking

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:90%
in other cities.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.461 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So in terms
of your experience,

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.172 align:middle line:84%
you say these guys
are former FBI agents.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.591 align:middle line:84%
But there was no government
control apparatus

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle line:90%
that you noticed.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to be simply
former government agents who

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.722 align:middle line:84%
were utilizing
instruments and power that

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.434 align:middle line:84%
had been allocated to them
from their previous job?

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.227 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, I mean,
I think they're still

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.812 align:middle line:84%
holding clearances
because, you know,

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:53.066 align:middle line:84%
this isn't technology that you
and I can Google and get a pass

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.567 align:middle line:90%
code and be able to access.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.236 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
clearance to do this.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.948 align:middle line:84%
And I think after some of the
initial mind-control studies

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:03.577 align:middle line:84%
through MKUltra and
other programs-- we

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:90%
had the Rockefeller Commission.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.413 align:middle line:84%
We had the Church
Committee hearings.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.914 align:middle line:84%
They kind of got
their hand slapped.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.374 align:middle line:84%
So I think they've
kind of moved it

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:12.794 align:middle line:84%
into the private sector
basically using subcontractors.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.589 align:middle line:84%
As you know, there's more
people with clearances now

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.298 align:middle line:84%
outside government
than there are inside.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.718 align:middle line:84%
The privatization of
power has been tremendous.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.928 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say, you mentioned
certain surveillance

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.556 align:middle line:84%
instruments that they had to
utilize government clearances

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:90%
to access.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:25.891 align:middle line:90%
What type?

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.685 align:middle line:84%
Because you mentioned Rohypnol
and basic gang stalkings.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.729 align:middle line:84%
But what technologies
were they using?

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: The technology that
appears that they're using

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.776 align:middle line:84%
is a form of technology called
remote neural monitoring.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.153 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
back in the '70s,

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.071 align:middle line:84%
they worked on this early
in the '70s as a way

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to monitor pilots,
where you shoot

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.659 align:middle line:84%
two dissimilar frequencies
into the brain.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.704 align:middle line:84%
Each hemisphere will entrain
a different frequency.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.081 align:middle line:84%
When those two hemispheres
with two different frequencies

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.459 align:middle line:84%
compete, they spit out an
interference frequency.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.336 align:middle line:84%
And then it was found
that you could actually

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:57.547 align:middle line:84%
decode the EEG out of that
interference frequency.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.674 align:middle line:84%
The intended-- at
least the alleged

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.802 align:middle line:84%
intended use was to monitor
pilots for hallucinations

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.055 align:middle line:90%
and delusions and sleepiness.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:84%
That way, you could
buzz them to wake them

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle line:84%
back up when they're flying
these 48-hour sorties

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.019 align:middle line:90%
during wartime.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.522 align:middle line:84%
Well, once they figured
out that you could actually

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:18.193 align:middle line:84%
entrain that EEG and cause
changes in mindfulness, changes

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
in attitude, changes
in emotion, it

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.115 align:middle line:84%
began being used on
those parameters.

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.867 align:middle line:84%
Kind of one of
the earliest forms

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.954 align:middle line:84%
we saw that was
actually the Woodpecker

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:32.123 align:middle line:84%
signal at the embassy in
Moscow, where they noticed

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that every time
Nixon went there,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.876 align:middle line:84%
he'd have emotional
disturbances,

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.461 align:middle line:90%
emotional breakdowns.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.089 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out that
certain ELF-wave signals

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.092 align:middle line:84%
specifically can
entrain into the brain.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.971 align:middle line:84%
And one way to think of
it is having a EEG catalog

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:48.265 align:middle line:84%
of different EEG
waveforms that correspond

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:53.645 align:middle line:84%
to emotional states of
depression or anger, you know.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.856 align:middle line:84%
And once you entrain
the brain with that EEG,

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
then that person
will demonstrate

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.359 align:middle line:90%
that state of emotion.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.111 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you're
saying they can not only

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.655 align:middle line:84%
monitor the emotional
state but actually

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.615 align:middle line:84%
program the emotional
state into the person.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.241 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Exactly.

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:06.825 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Remotely.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Exactly.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.076 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Hmm.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.161 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And along with
that also comes the ability

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.163 align:middle line:84%
to communicate because
it was actually

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:84%
found that using
microwave energy

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.001 align:middle line:84%
and using ELF-wave technology
that you could actually

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.754 align:middle line:84%
communicate with someone in a
pseudo-telepathic kind of way.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.173 align:middle line:84%
There's two things that
you'll hear from victims.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.426 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this
with my ex-fiance

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.887 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote about, that not
only would she hear voices

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
in her head, like many of the
targeted individuals here,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.558 align:middle line:84%
but she would hear voices
in her surroundings

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.312 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to be
amplified by vibrations.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:36.813 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
common thing you

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.982 align:middle line:84%
see with a lot of these
targeted individuals.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:42.319 align:middle line:84%
They'll describe that when
I'm underneath a ceiling fan,

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.864 align:middle line:84%
I'll hear voices in the ceiling
fan or voice patterning.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.783 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things we
noticed is in aquarium pumps,

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:52.495 align:middle line:84%
running water actually has
a strong vibratory source

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.832 align:middle line:84%
to amplify incoming
transmissions.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.667 align:middle line:84%
And you could hear voice
patterning and then

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.337 align:middle line:84%
over time with enough
concentration actually

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.921 align:middle line:90%
hear the communication.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.507 align:middle line:84%
Oddly, this seems to
be person-specific.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.635 align:middle line:84%
So even though the person
sitting right next to you

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.346 align:middle line:84%
may actually hear these voices
and hear these communications,

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.723 align:middle line:84%
you may not, sitting
right next to them.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.351 align:middle line:84%
It still seems to be
magnitude and frequency

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.144 align:middle line:90%
specific to the individual.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.398 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we are basically
water and various molecules

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.192 align:middle line:84%
that are vibrating at
certain frequencies.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.945 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is if they
can figure out your basic

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.239 align:middle line:84%
frequency-- operating frequency
for your brain-- then--

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.157 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: It's specific to you.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.575 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --they can get
specific into targeting you.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:30.867 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.119 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Now, my question now
would be why your fiance?

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37.624 align:middle line:84%
Because it would seem it would
be costly for these ex-FBI guys

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.335 align:middle line:84%
to basically just be harassing
her and monitoring her

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.003 align:middle line:90%
just for sexual purposes, no?

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:42.796 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.007 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a common question.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what every targeted
individual hears eventually.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Why you?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.765 align:middle line:84%
I think at its root, it's
non-consensual experimentation.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:57.018 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why you're
seeing it so widespread.

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.771 align:middle line:84%
As you know, they'll
tend to pick common folks

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.897 align:middle line:90%
to do this kind of work on.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:03.483 align:middle line:84%
If you look at MKUltra or
any of the other mind-control

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:84%
experimentations, they
didn't pick people

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.947 align:middle line:84%
who had political clout or
who had financial clout.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.741 align:middle line:84%
They picked the common people
who have no way to fight back

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.244 align:middle line:84%
and don't have the contacts
in order to stop it.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.746 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
best way to explain

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle line:84%
it is there are individual
groups in every major city that

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.167 align:middle line:90%
have access to the technology.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.711 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
allowed carte blanche

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.587 align:middle line:84%
to use it however
they want to use it,

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.215 align:middle line:84%
as long as the data gets
back to the agencies that

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.551 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for
actually giving the release.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm-hm.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
So the idea would
be that this is

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.057 align:middle line:84%
basic-- there's a long history
of abuse by the US government,

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.226 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
FBI and surveillance

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.688 align:middle line:84%
and monitoring of targeted
populations and individuals,

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.522 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.148 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Oh, without question.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And counterintelligence
programs to basically discredit

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
people more from
political perspectives,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to the CIA and NSA doing
various types of monitoring

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.783 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence gathering.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying beyond
that, there's also

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.996 align:middle line:84%
a history of actual
experimentation

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.039 align:middle line:84%
by the government on
the population, correct?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:00.832 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Oh yeah.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The US government
has experimented

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.253 align:middle line:84%
on the-- there's no laws against
the government experimenting

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.046 align:middle line:90%
on the population.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.965 align:middle line:84%
John Glenn tried to pass
legislation through Congress

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.134 align:middle line:90%
that was shot down.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.804 align:middle line:84%
Most people will focus on the
Nuremberg Code or the Helsinki

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle line:84%
Accord and say, well,
these are the safeguards

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.852 align:middle line:84%
against a tyrannical government
experimenting on the public.

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:21.978 align:middle line:90%
Those are suggestions.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.313 align:middle line:90%
Those aren't American law.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.482 align:middle line:84%
You're not United
States legislation.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.568 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
there are no safeguards.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.779 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we had
the Bioethics Commissions

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.449 align:middle line:84%
that were held-- six different
meetings-- after they found out

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.826 align:middle line:84%
that Nicaraguans
were experimented on

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.662 align:middle line:84%
with weaponized syphilis
bacteria and gonorrhea

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:40.914 align:middle line:90%
bacteria.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.707 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the
Bioethics Commission

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:45.919 align:middle line:84%
was to determine if any
non-consensual experimentation

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle line:84%
was still ongoing, sponsored
by the United States,

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.048 align:middle line:90%
either here or abroad.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:52.091 align:middle line:84%
Well, I spoke at one
of these meetings,

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.844 align:middle line:84%
and they had a public
forum in each one.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:58.389 align:middle line:84%
Each public forum had over
1,000 people, and all of them

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:01.476 align:middle line:84%
were voicing complaints
of mind-control technology

00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and directed energy attacks.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.313 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
day, they basically

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:09.275 align:middle line:84%
said that there was no evidence
of any ongoing non-consensual

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.235 align:middle line:90%
experimentation.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.654 align:middle line:84%
You know, and despite having
those kind of numbers showing

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:13.947 align:middle line:90%
up complaining of just that.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.365 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, what
are the numbers

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:19.494 align:middle line:84%
you've seen as far as
people across America who

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.372 align:middle line:84%
seem to be targeted and
are not just coming out

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.666 align:middle line:84%
of a mental hospital or have
a history of mental health

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:28.336 align:middle line:84%
but genuinely having issues
of being targeted, as far

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.381 align:middle line:84%
as whether it's private
or private companies

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.174 align:middle line:84%
or potentially
government behind it?

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.551 align:middle line:90%
What do the numbers look like?

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.637 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Based on
surveys that we've

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.432 align:middle line:84%
done through Freedom From
Surveillance and Harassment

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:43.268 align:middle line:84%
and other human
rights groups, it

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.354 align:middle line:84%
looks to be about anywhere
from 200,000 to 300,000 people

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.564 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.148 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just in
the United States.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.651 align:middle line:84%
Now, I get emails
from people globally

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.612 align:middle line:84%
and messages to the office
from people globally every day.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.489 align:middle line:90%
So this is a global problem.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.908 align:middle line:84%
And I think every
industrialized nation probably

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.787 align:middle line:84%
has worked on this technology
or derived it from us

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.205 align:middle line:90%
to work on their own programs.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.331 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there's
obviously-- there's precedent.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.958 align:middle line:90%
There's historical precedent.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.751 align:middle line:84%
We talked-- you
mentioned MKUltra.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.297 align:middle line:84%
And obviously Army-- Tuskegee
experiments on black people--

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.257 align:middle line:84%
injecting them with
syphilis, I believe it was.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.091 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.052 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what
is it that-- what

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would be your main go-to
arguments historically

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.641 align:middle line:84%
for the main precedent
that people could say, oh,

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.475 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't happen.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.685 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at these cases.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.394 align:middle line:90%
What are the main ones?

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:27.312 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, and
that's the argument

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I lay out in my latest
book "Guinea Pigs."

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
The first few
chapters are based on

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.112 align:middle line:84%
non-consensual experimentation
in our country.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We've long experimented
on children

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.034 align:middle line:90%
in homes for the mentally ill.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.369 align:middle line:84%
Some of the earliest forms
at least of this technology

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:46.623 align:middle line:84%
were actually on prisoners
in Utah state prison,

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.459 align:middle line:84%
where we had five prisoners that
talked about actually having

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.627 align:middle line:90%
voices placed in their head.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.171 align:middle line:84%
They were placed in
a room by themselves

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.257 align:middle line:84%
where they describe that
the electromagnetic energy

00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.052 align:middle line:84%
in the room was so heavy that
they had a hard time getting

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.136 align:middle line:90%
off their cots.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:03.514 align:middle line:84%
One particular prisoner said
that it was very evident

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.391 align:middle line:84%
that the voices he was
hearing in his head

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:08.144 align:middle line:84%
were responding appropriately
to his thoughts.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:11.522 align:middle line:84%
This was in the
'70s and early '80s.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.899 align:middle line:90%
And then you mentioned MKUltra.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.068 align:middle line:84%
That all came out in
Freedom of Information.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Those were the 189
sub-projects, all

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.114 align:middle line:84%
geared at trying to figure
out how to remotely control

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.532 align:middle line:90%
a human being.

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:23.076 align:middle line:90%
And it was complete research.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.954 align:middle line:84%
It was research based
on childhood behavior

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.165 align:middle line:84%
all the way up through brain
implantation that Delgado did.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.376 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't
really miss any facet

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.128 align:middle line:84%
of experimenting
on or researching

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:36.673 align:middle line:84%
on what makes a human
tick and how well you

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.632 align:middle line:90%
can control a human.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.968 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And we didn't even
know most of the MKUltra work

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.552 align:middle line:84%
because most of it was
shredded, I believe.

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:42.053 align:middle line:84%
It was only a little
bit that came out.

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:43.638 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Most of it
was shredded, yeah.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:45.932 align:middle line:84%
What we did get were
the financial records.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:46.849 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:48.726 align:middle line:84%
They were housed in
a different building.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.353 align:middle line:84%
And they'd avoided
being shredded.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.523 align:middle line:84%
So we did get to see what
front companies were created

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.483 align:middle line:84%
and what universities
were taking part

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.027 align:middle line:84%
in what looked like legitimate
research at the time.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm-hm.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.072 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Interesting thing
is now we have the new brain

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:03.783 align:middle line:84%
initiative, where they're going
to finish mapping the brain,

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:04.742 align:middle line:90%
allegedly.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.202 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
research is being

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.705 align:middle line:84%
done at McGill
University in Canada,

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
which McGill University
was one of the big players

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.916 align:middle line:90%
with MKUltra.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.876 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that's
any coincidence either.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:14.711 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:18.256 align:middle line:84%
So Snowden came out with these
disclosures a few years ago

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:20.925 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, the NSA
is using private--

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:24.887 align:middle line:84%
is accessing private companies'
data on people, right,

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it be emails or
phone companies or whatnot

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.475 align:middle line:84%
and collecting and
surveilling you that way.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.144 align:middle line:84%
And they can also
access your computer

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.687 align:middle line:84%
and turn your
camera on-- I mean,

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.481 align:middle line:84%
very basic, commonsense
things for anyone

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.775 align:middle line:84%
who understood how the
intelligence community works.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.694 align:middle line:84%
And this was basically
a big surprise.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.155 align:middle line:84%
But this just seems to
be the tip of the iceberg

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.657 align:middle line:84%
because these guys are far
beyond just surveilling us.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.701 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be they're
at the place of being

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.412 align:middle line:84%
able to surveil and actually try
to mind-control and manipulate

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:50.246 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Snowden did us a
big favor by releasing that.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.043 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he-- it was
stuff that I think

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.503 align:middle line:84%
is graspable for the
normal population

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:02.467 align:middle line:84%
that maybe isn't too educated
on exotic technologies.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.885 align:middle line:84%
But certainly,
what he did release

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:07.013 align:middle line:84%
showed what targeted individuals
have been saying all along.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.391 align:middle line:84%
You could sit at a computer
and look at your emails

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
and see that somebody is
reading and erasing your emails

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.521 align:middle line:90%
as you're looking at them.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:84%
We found out about the
interdiction program

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.402 align:middle line:84%
through him, essentially where
our computers and our phones

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.405 align:middle line:84%
are interdicted by the
NSA and pre-installed

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.909 align:middle line:84%
with software and chips that
allow them to be monitored.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look at some
of the relationships

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.581 align:middle line:84%
that the providers
like Google and AT&T

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:38.002 align:middle line:84%
have formed with the NSA, that
they're basically giving them

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:39.337 align:middle line:90%
inroads into the technology.

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.297 align:middle line:84%
And even though
I've spoken mostly

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.175 align:middle line:84%
about satellite-directed energy
weapons and things like that,

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.009 align:middle line:90%
it's growing.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.719 align:middle line:84%
There's growing knowledge
that a lot of this

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.513 align:middle line:84%
is being done through
our cell phones, too.

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's a mystery
that the government wanted

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:56.354 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the population
was actually allowed or given

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.397 align:middle line:84%
smartphones if they
didn't already have them

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.942 align:middle line:84%
because the technology
that's in the smartphone now

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:03.528 align:middle line:84%
is-- there's a lot of ways to
monitor you through the phone

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.823 align:middle line:84%
and track you through
the phone, as well, too.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.783 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Certainly, GPS
on your phone, I mean.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And most of the apps
ask for your GPS.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.789 align:middle line:84%
So it would seem actually
the private corporations

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.417 align:middle line:84%
could be utilizing as much
of basically the techniques

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:22.421 align:middle line:84%
for surveillance and social
control as the government

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.881 align:middle line:84%
because the
corporations would want

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:27.051 align:middle line:84%
to use it for marketing purposes
and for sales-profit purposes,

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:27.844 align:middle line:90%
no?

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, even
more than GPS,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.013 align:middle line:84%
they have systems
now that can actually

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:33.099 align:middle line:90%
monitor you in a Wi-Fi grid.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's through your phone.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.645 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're-- even if your
phone is not connected to where

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.814 align:middle line:84%
you're looking for
a Wi-Fi signal,

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.525 align:middle line:84%
it still will send push
notifications to your phone

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and can monitor your whereabouts
based on an existing Wi-Fi

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.571 align:middle line:90%
grid.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.822 align:middle line:90%
It's called Wi-Fi tracking.

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.324 align:middle line:84%
And it's very popular right
now, especially in stores

00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
because that way, as you
walk down the aisles,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.078 align:middle line:90%
they know what aisle you're on.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
ad to push to you

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.332 align:middle line:84%
to make you interested in
buying whatever product

00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.834 align:middle line:90%
may be that on that aisle.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.794 align:middle line:84%
The other big one through
cell phone technology

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.755 align:middle line:84%
now is called Bluetooth
Low Energy beacons.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:08.217 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
actually constantly manipulate

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:11.179 align:middle line:84%
your Bluetooth signal to be
able to track you spatially.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.598 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But it seems
that people-- part

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.392 align:middle line:84%
of the reason I feel that
the millennials didn't really

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:18.686 align:middle line:84%
respond that much to
Snowden's revelations

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:20.188 align:middle line:84%
is because we've
already surrendered

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.355 align:middle line:90%
our right to privacy.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:24.192 align:middle line:84%
That's very much the
basis of the various apps

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.068 align:middle line:84%
like the Instagrams
and Snapchats

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:28.279 align:middle line:84%
and the whole nature
of social media.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.281 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes back to
the creation of Facebook,

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.576 align:middle line:84%
where some people suggested
the CIA may have been involved

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA was asking at
that point for a way for people

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to basically put their
social, political beliefs

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.669 align:middle line:84%
in a basic hub and
locate themselves.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.379 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Facebook does, right?

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.965 align:middle line:84%
So do you see it as
that basically we've

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:51.344 align:middle line:84%
surrendered to this
complete control apparatus?

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.388 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Certainly, probably
anybody under the age of 40

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:55.681 align:middle line:90%
or most under the age of 40.

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:56.474 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:17:01.479 align:middle line:84%
I think Facebook specifically
was started with money

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:03.731 align:middle line:84%
from In-Q-Tel, which
is a venture capital

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:04.941 align:middle line:90%
firm for the CIA.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a data-mining
tool from the beginning.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:90%
And how perfect is it?

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, they don't have
to research you or do

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.616 align:middle line:84%
any high-profile
counter-surveillance

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:14.575 align:middle line:90%
or surveillance.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:17.912 align:middle line:84%
You're giving them all
the information they know.

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.872 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is on your comment

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.666 align:middle line:84%
about the younger generation
already kind of giving up

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.585 align:middle line:84%
is I do lectures on
right to privacy.

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.002 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
first things I tell

00:17:26.002 --> 00:17:27.964 align:middle line:84%
people-- don't put
all your information

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.548 align:middle line:84%
about your whereabouts
and what you're

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.801 align:middle line:90%
doing on Facebook and online.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:35.179 align:middle line:84%
And the most typical answer I
get from a younger population

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:36.389 align:middle line:90%
is what's it matter?

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.099 align:middle line:84%
The government knows
everything already.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.559 align:middle line:84%
They've already
essentially given up.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.852 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm-hm.

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:44.939 align:middle line:84%
But beyond being surveilled,
which is one thing.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.608 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, OK,
we're in a country

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
with this technology that makes
it much easier to communicate,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.238 align:middle line:84%
to know each
other's whereabouts.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.407 align:middle line:84%
There is that-- OK, there's
some level of knowledge.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.993 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a difference,
which is the actual abuse of it

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.912 align:middle line:84%
and the actual use of these
mind-control technologies

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.705 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.624 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask, what does
satellite terrorism mean?

00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you talk about this
idea of satellite terrorism,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.089 align:middle line:84%
using energy weapons
against us, the population.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.551 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
play a role in what

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.094 align:middle line:84%
these corporations
and the government

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
are trying to do-- essentially
control the population?

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.724 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Well, and I
think we call it that.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.976 align:middle line:84%
Or the title of
the book was listed

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.728 align:middle line:84%
as that is because I
think any time you're

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:27.523 align:middle line:84%
being attacked by something,
and there's absolutely

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.357 align:middle line:90%
no reason for it.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:33.362 align:middle line:84%
I guess an account could
be made for if you were

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
a whistle-blower,
and your own agency

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:90%
comes after you or something.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.077 align:middle line:84%
But most of the people I
deal with are common people.

00:18:40.077 --> 00:18:43.998 align:middle line:84%
They're doctors, lawyers,
janitors, teachers.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.958 align:middle line:84%
They're there from
the common ranks.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.003 align:middle line:84%
They're not radical political
opponents of the government.

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not out trying to
overthrow the government.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.008 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people I've
dealt with don't even vote.

00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:55.551 align:middle line:84%
Yet they're being
experimented on.

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:58.179 align:middle line:84%
So I think the reason we
chose the term terrorism

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.598 align:middle line:84%
because they're having
pain inflicted on them

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and actually having people
try to manipulate their belief

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.104 align:middle line:84%
systems through
surveillance and attack

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.691 align:middle line:84%
against their will, which
by definition is terrorism.

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.486 align:middle line:84%
And it's being done by our
government on its own people.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.278 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm-hm.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.113 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: So that was the
reason for the title

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.491 align:middle line:84%
of the book, my
first book, because I

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.159 align:middle line:84%
don't think anyone
would recognize this

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.579 align:middle line:84%
as I'm doing this
for the greater good,

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.582 align:middle line:84%
for the surveillance
state, or for security.

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people
are being tortured.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to any amount of
them, they're sitting at home.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.423 align:middle line:90%
They lose their jobs.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.842 align:middle line:84%
When they do try to confide
in their physicians,

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.719 align:middle line:84%
they're usually sent
to a psychiatrist.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.221 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring in
all their research.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.014 align:middle line:84%
And where there's
obviously three or four

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.975 align:middle line:84%
different technological ways to
put voices in somebody's head,

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
but all the psychiatrist hears
is you're hearing voices.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.312 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.314 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And we've been
all trained to understand

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:52.858 align:middle line:84%
that if, well, if you're hearing
voices, you're mentally ill.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
They never ask what
the voices are saying.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.111 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Because
these people aren't

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
describing God talking to them
or angels talking to them.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.992 align:middle line:84%
They're describing
somebody letting

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:05.079 align:middle line:84%
them know that they know
their whereabouts spatially.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.914 align:middle line:84%
Typically, what they
say the voices say is,

00:20:06.914 --> 00:20:09.166 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're walking
down the hallway.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.709 align:middle line:90%
You're going into the store.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
You're getting in your car.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.255 align:middle line:84%
They make it very
obvious to the target

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:16.298 align:middle line:90%
that they are being surveilled.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.259 align:middle line:84%
But the psychiatrist
won't hear that.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:20.928 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatrist, they focus
on you're hearing voices.

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.388 align:middle line:84%
Let's rope you into
a monthly visit

00:20:22.388 --> 00:20:23.472 align:middle line:90%
and put you on some drugs.

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:26.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So beyond the issue of
mass control of the population

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.479 align:middle line:84%
and using these terrorism
techniques for experimentation,

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.064 align:middle line:84%
I wonder when I see
some of these mass

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:84%
shooters-- I think of the
Tsarnaev brothers or James

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:39.447 align:middle line:84%
Holmes, Adam Lanza-- and
how checked-out they look.

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.532 align:middle line:84%
When I see their pictures,
right, these kids

00:20:41.532 --> 00:20:43.325 align:middle line:90%
look completely vacant.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:44.535 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes are vacant.

00:20:44.535 --> 00:20:48.038 align:middle line:84%
And given the history of
MKUltra and given the way

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:51.333 align:middle line:84%
that we know government can
and these private corporations

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:56.464 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with government
can basically project voices

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.966 align:middle line:84%
and terrorize and
target people, do

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.969 align:middle line:84%
you think it's possible that
some of these mass shooters

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.637 align:middle line:84%
or terrorists have
been mind controlled?

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.306 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Oh, I don't
think it's possible.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:90%
I think it's happening.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.767 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, two
of them I can point to you.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.937 align:middle line:84%
Aaron Alexis, the
Navy Yard shooter,

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.481 align:middle line:84%
he had been in
contact with Freedom

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.524 align:middle line:90%
for Information several times.

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.401 align:middle line:84%
Had complained about
the voices in his head,

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:84%
had complained about being
stalked and being followed.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.364 align:middle line:84%
His biggest complaint
was the sleep deprivation

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.575 align:middle line:90%
they were causing on him.

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:27.244 align:middle line:84%
As you remember, when he
went on his shooting rampage,

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.954 align:middle line:84%
he carved "this
is my ELF weapon"

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.581 align:middle line:90%
on the side of his shotgun.

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:34.293 align:middle line:84%
The FBI in their release said
it was a cryptic message,

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.836 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
understand that why

00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.505 align:middle line:84%
he put that on the
end of his shotgun

00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:39.632 align:middle line:84%
or the side of his
shotgun, when in reality

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:43.636 align:middle line:84%
that probably wasn't a crazy
guy going amok at the Navy Yard.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.554 align:middle line:90%
That was a vengeance shooting.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:46.472 align:middle line:90%
He had a clearance.

00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:52.478 align:middle line:84%
He worked loosely near
the technology with IT.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
He thought that
some of the research

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:90%
was being done at the Navy Yard.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.815 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
vengeance shooting.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: ELF meaning
Extremely Low Frequency--

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.277 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Extremely Low
Frequency waves, yeah.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:03.113 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research has been
done in extremely low frequency

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.698 align:middle line:84%
waves and their
ability to interact

00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:05.699 align:middle line:90%
with the nervous system.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.617 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Mm-hm.

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:08.202 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Another
shooter was Myron May

00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:09.411 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Florida.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:11.372 align:middle line:90%
This was a man educated.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:16.293 align:middle line:84%
Had been a prosecuting attorney
in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:19.713 align:middle line:84%
Had moved to Florida to
start a new practice there,

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.132 align:middle line:84%
and then went and
started a shooting

00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:23.592 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Florida.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.344 align:middle line:84%
Well, before he went
and did the shooting,

00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:28.847 align:middle line:84%
he actually had
sent out USB sticks

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:31.392 align:middle line:84%
to several different people
with sort of his manifesto

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:33.018 align:middle line:90%
and his reason for doing it.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.104 align:middle line:84%
Albeit I don't agree
with the reasoning,

00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
his reasoning was that he had
to do something really horrible

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:84%
to garner media
attention to the problem.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.236 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
wrong attention,

00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.655 align:middle line:84%
and certainly we'd
try to dissuade anyone

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:90%
from doing anything violent.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.993 align:middle line:84%
But that was his
take, that he had

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:90%
been controlled long enough.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.246 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't going to be
controlled any longer

00:22:52.246 --> 00:22:54.748 align:middle line:84%
and that the only way the
media would cover mind control

00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.334 align:middle line:84%
was to do something
really deplorable.

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:00.671 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So is it possible that
there is a control apparatus

00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.673 align:middle line:84%
within the government
that utilize-- as you just

00:23:02.673 --> 00:23:06.635 align:middle line:84%
mentioned-- we know that
these private contractors are

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.179 align:middle line:84%
implementing a lot of
the actual harassment.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.432 align:middle line:84%
But there could be some
branch, whether it's

00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:15.477 align:middle line:84%
deep within CIA or
NSA, that's actually

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:18.272 align:middle line:84%
monitoring and deciding,
OK, this is a perfect patsy.

00:23:18.272 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deploy this
person as our lone gunman

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.779 align:middle line:84%
or a mass shooter, whether or
not the person actually does

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.865 align:middle line:84%
the shooting or is
just blamed for it,

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:30.826 align:middle line:84%
based on-- how do you say?--
based on basically culling

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.162 align:middle line:84%
the archive of who they
already have available.

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:34.663 align:middle line:84%
They basically amass
this population

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.081 align:middle line:84%
that they're
targeting, harassing.

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:37.916 align:middle line:84%
And then they can--
with some apparatus

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.627 align:middle line:84%
where the government
can basically choose

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.545 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, we need
to do an operation.

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
This is the person we're going
to use as our fall guy for it.

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:45.758 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah, certainly.

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's always been
that apparatus in place.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.971 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember, the
initial studies with this

00:23:50.971 --> 00:23:55.184 align:middle line:84%
were completely designed to
create Manchurian candidates--

00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:56.769 align:middle line:84%
people they could
send out on missions

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and then revert them back to
their normal personality state

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.317 align:middle line:84%
after they had done something
in an altered personality state.

00:24:03.317 --> 00:24:05.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, the two parts of your
brain that control those

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:08.072 align:middle line:84%
don't recognize each other
and don't know each other.

00:24:08.072 --> 00:24:08.864 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:11.283 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: So if I were to
control you to go do a bombing

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and then bring you back
in as your own personality

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.705 align:middle line:84%
and ask you about it,
you'll defend to the death

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:18.582 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't done it.

00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:22.002 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think a lot of the
targeting that we're seeing now

00:24:22.002 --> 00:24:25.547 align:middle line:84%
probably is actually having
a selection of people that

00:24:25.547 --> 00:24:27.174 align:middle line:90%
can be used in that manner.

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's a scary thought.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.051 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:31.387 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: That's a ticking time
bomb, as a matter of fact.

00:24:31.387 --> 00:24:32.429 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Well, absolutely it is.

00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:34.181 align:middle line:84%
Given the information
that you've come across

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.557 align:middle line:84%
and the people that
are being harassed,

00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:36.975 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are
techniques you tell

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.769 align:middle line:84%
them to actually deal
with the harassment

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:41.855 align:middle line:84%
and how to survive
this type of terrorism?

00:24:41.855 --> 00:24:43.899 align:middle line:84%
Because frankly, if
you are being targeted,

00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:47.611 align:middle line:84%
and you're hearing voices, and
you're being kept from sleep,

00:24:47.611 --> 00:24:49.321 align:middle line:84%
and all types of
techniques are being

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:52.825 align:middle line:84%
used to stabilize your life,
how do you deal with that?

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: One of the things
I tell people personally

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.621 align:middle line:84%
is to not try to convince
people that don't believe you

00:24:57.621 --> 00:24:58.706 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:24:58.706 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
This is so exotic, it is
so creepy, and so scary

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.754 align:middle line:84%
that even people who may
kind of believe you really

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:07.089 align:middle line:90%
don't want to know this exists.

00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:09.425 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things that's
kind of swept under the rug.

00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:11.427 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's the most
complained-about crime

00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:13.512 align:middle line:84%
on the internet
today, there's nothing

00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:16.056 align:middle line:84%
being done about it really
except for people like you

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.392 align:middle line:90%
that are helping expose it.

00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:20.978 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first
things I tell people is

00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:22.771 align:middle line:84%
don't go off trying to
convince your family

00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:25.232 align:middle line:84%
or trying to convince
co-workers that it's going on.

00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:27.067 align:middle line:84%
If you mention it, and
they don't believe it

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:28.736 align:middle line:84%
or they question
it, just let it go.

00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.279 align:middle line:84%
There are human
rights organizations

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:31.739 align:middle line:84%
that deal with
this, where you can

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:33.532 align:middle line:84%
vent to people who
already understand you

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.951 align:middle line:90%
and know what's happening.

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:38.078 align:middle line:84%
The more violent or
the more aggressive

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:40.539 align:middle line:84%
you get in trying to convert
people to believe you,

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:41.582 align:middle line:90%
the more crazy you look.

00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:43.208 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that's
going to sit you

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in front of a psychiatrist who's
also not going to believe you.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.672 align:middle line:84%
All they're going to focus on
is if you're hearing voices,

00:25:48.672 --> 00:25:49.965 align:middle line:84%
they're going to put
you on medications

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.842 align:middle line:84%
that have side effects
that still won't work.

00:25:51.842 --> 00:25:53.761 align:middle line:84%
The targeting will
still continue.

00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the case of
somebody who maybe really

00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:57.765 align:middle line:84%
is suffering from mental
illness-- you know,

00:25:57.765 --> 00:26:00.392 align:middle line:84%
schizophrenia-- the drugs
do work in schizophrenia.

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:03.061 align:middle line:84%
Most schizophrenics, as long
as they take their medications,

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:90%
do get better.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.608 align:middle line:84%
With targeting, the
psychiatric meds don't help.

00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:10.986 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen people who
have been falsely diagnosed

00:26:10.986 --> 00:26:13.864 align:middle line:84%
as schizophrenic forced
into medication treatment.

00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:15.199 align:middle line:90%
And then you talk to them later.

00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:16.992 align:middle line:84%
And they go, yeah,
I'm still hearing it.

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:19.203 align:middle line:84%
And I've still got people
parking outside of my house.

00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I still got people following me.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.749 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it is
hard to discriminate.

00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:26.001 align:middle line:84%
As a physician, I'm not going
to sit here and tell you

00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.294 align:middle line:90%
mental illness doesn't exist.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:28.837 align:middle line:90%
We both know it does.

00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:30.589 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
technologies out there

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.382 align:middle line:84%
that are developed
specifically to mimic

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:33.926 align:middle line:90%
those mental illnesses.

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So to just turnkey
diagnose somebody

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.348 align:middle line:84%
as schizophrenic or delusional
when we know of at least three

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:42.226 align:middle line:84%
or four technologies that can
put voices in your head-- now

00:26:42.226 --> 00:26:44.561 align:middle line:84%
we know COINTELPRO
started gang stalking

00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:47.981 align:middle line:84%
and what I actually
term organized stalking.

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:48.857 align:middle line:90%
It does exist.

00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:51.777 align:middle line:84%
There's too many
cases of it now that I

00:26:51.777 --> 00:26:53.695 align:middle line:84%
think it's time
that psychiatrists,

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.614 align:middle line:84%
psychologists take
a second look.

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And my whole take on this--
and the reason for my activism

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.954 align:middle line:84%
and my books-- has been
that there's so many people

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
complaining about this now that
the complaints are identical--

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:84%
not similar; they're
identical-- that maybe it's

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.253 align:middle line:84%
time for another
congressional hearing

00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:11.755 align:middle line:84%
to get some subpoenas out there
to see if this technology is

00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:12.714 align:middle line:90%
being used on the public.

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:13.507 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:15.467 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: Unfortunately,
we're asking

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.512 align:middle line:84%
the exact people that are doing
it to us to help remedy it.

00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's been the problem.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.557 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, and it's
an even deeper problem

00:27:21.557 --> 00:27:23.851 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that the police
force and the local police

00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:26.478 align:middle line:84%
force does nothing to protect
people because that just shows,

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.731 align:middle line:84%
I guess, how in bed our
system is, essentially,

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.818 align:middle line:84%
from the top down in
its control apparatus

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:36.738 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the local and
county levels of policing.

00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:38.657 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: And one
thing I will tell you

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:42.119 align:middle line:84%
that I was happy to see at
one of the local PDs in Texas,

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.662 align:middle line:84%
there was one lady
calling the police.

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.956 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know, my
garage doors are opening

00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:47.165 align:middle line:90%
and closing on their own.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:50.043 align:middle line:84%
My computer's going
off and on, on its own.

00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:50.919 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing voices.

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:52.379 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
buzz in the place.

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.715 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm being
electronically harassed.

00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:55.924 align:middle line:90%
And I was happy to hear this.

00:27:55.924 --> 00:27:58.468 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's nothing
much the local police can really

00:27:58.468 --> 00:28:00.512 align:middle line:84%
do to help you with
that, they can certainly

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.805 align:middle line:90%
help with the stalking.

00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:04.224 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I do tell these victims.

00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:05.642 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you
report the stalking.

00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:84%
There are stalking laws
in just about every state.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.898 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot mention the
rest of the exotic stuff,

00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:12.524 align:middle line:84%
they will help you
deal with stalking.

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.736 align:middle line:84%
But this one officer did
show up to this lady's house.

00:28:15.736 --> 00:28:18.155 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it sounds like
what you're going through

00:28:18.155 --> 00:28:19.573 align:middle line:90%
is electronic harassment.

00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:22.242 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I don't
know how to help you.

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:24.286 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are
some officers that

00:28:24.286 --> 00:28:26.038 align:middle line:90%
are being educated on it now.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:27.956 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's from seeing
some shows like this

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
or maybe reading books
that are written on it.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.792 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:33.879 align:middle line:84%
>>HALL: I don't think they're
all endemically included

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:35.297 align:middle line:90%
in the harassment.

00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:37.215 align:middle line:84%
I think there are good
officers out there that

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:40.677 align:middle line:84%
still will try to come and
help you, at least not 5150 you

00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:42.721 align:middle line:90%
or send you to a psychiatrist.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.598 align:middle line:84%
And one of the steps
that we made recently

00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:46.183 align:middle line:84%
was out in Richmond,
California, where

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:48.727 align:middle line:84%
we did meet with the
city council out there.

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:51.939 align:middle line:84%
We kind of pleaded the case
that not everybody that

00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:54.399 align:middle line:84%
complains of this is crazy
because in California

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.276 align:middle line:84%
specifically, a
lot of these people

00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:58.946 align:middle line:84%
were getting 5150ed,
which means forced entry

00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:02.032 align:middle line:84%
into a mental hospital
for evaluation.

00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:03.909 align:middle line:84%
The Richmond City
Council did agree

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:08.205 align:middle line:84%
that to start a, basically, a
checklist that the police could

00:29:08.205 --> 00:29:10.707 align:middle line:84%
go through where if you're
not a danger to yourself

00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
or voicing a danger to others
that they, instead of taking

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.421 align:middle line:84%
those people in, would refer
them to organizations that

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.548 align:middle line:84%
can help them understand
what's going through them.

00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:19.758 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge step.

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:21.718 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Yeah, and it
seems like the whole point

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:24.763 align:middle line:84%
is that books like yours,
programs like this discussing

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:27.891 align:middle line:84%
it, making people
aware of the targeting

00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:30.394 align:middle line:84%
and the actual reality
of the situation

00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:32.604 align:middle line:84%
can hopefully enlighten
people so that they

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:36.358 align:middle line:84%
don't look askance or
run away from someone

00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:37.609 align:middle line:90%
who claims to be targeted.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.528 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
people are aware of this,

00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:41.571 align:middle line:84%
the more that we can
actually force a shift

00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:43.573 align:middle line:84%
and protect those who are
being targeted, right?

00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:44.366 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Yeah.

00:29:44.366 --> 00:29:48.161 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's working
because this is growing.

00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:49.037 align:middle line:90%
It's not going away.

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not getting smaller.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.791 align:middle line:84%
I get 10 to 20 messages at
my office every morning.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.792 align:middle line:90%
And they're not medical.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:56.378 align:middle line:84%
It's not people seeking me
out for medical treatment.

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:59.673 align:middle line:84%
It's people seeking me out
based for targeting every day.

00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:01.216 align:middle line:84%
Every day, my
secretary comes back.

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.051 align:middle line:90%
And it's a stack of at least 20.

00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:04.761 align:middle line:84%
They need to talk to
you about targeting.

00:30:04.761 --> 00:30:06.096 align:middle line:90%
So it's growing.

00:30:06.096 --> 00:30:07.472 align:middle line:84%
And it's to the
point now where I

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.182 align:middle line:84%
think if you talk to
just about anybody,

00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.101 align:middle line:84%
and you mention, you
know, have you ever heard

00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:13.311 align:middle line:84%
of this electronic harassment,
electronic targeting,

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:16.398 align:middle line:84%
or organized stalking, just
about everybody will tell you,

00:30:16.398 --> 00:30:17.482 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I had a cousin.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:18.817 align:middle line:90%
Or I had a sister.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:21.069 align:middle line:84%
Or I knew a guy that
was talking about that.

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:23.822 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, they'll say,
we thought he was kind of nuts.

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.533 align:middle line:84%
But now there's so much
about it online and so much

00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:29.619 align:middle line:84%
being written about it
that it's got to be true.

00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what has
been the goal all along.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.622 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:33.415 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:34.416 align:middle line:90%
Raise the awareness.

00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
joining me today, Dr. Hall.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>HALL: Thank you, Sean.

00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:39.588 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there
you have it, folks,

00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:42.007 align:middle line:84%
some fascinating insights
today from Dr. John Hall.

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:44.301 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here.

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:46.511 align:middle line:84%
But I urge you to check out
his books-- "Guinea Pigs--

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:49.389 align:middle line:84%
Technologies of Control"
and "A New Breed-- Satellite

00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:51.058 align:middle line:90%
Terrorism in America."

00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:53.351 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path,

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.105 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.401 align:middle line:90%
