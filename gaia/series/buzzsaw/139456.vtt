>>SEAN STONE: Magic and
madness in the mouth

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Necronomicon.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.927 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:05.835 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:18.145 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:10%
With me today, I
have Jim Wasserman,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
who is an American
author and occultist.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.397 align:middle line:84%
A member of the
OTO since 1976, he

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
has written extensively
on spiritual and political

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:90%
liberty.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, he founded Studio 31,
where he produced the "Simon

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Necronomicon," a
volume purporting

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to be the mythical Necronomicon
made famous by Howard Phillips

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Lovecraft.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:10%
He has a new book coming out
called the "Templar Heresy."

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And today, he lifts the
veil on his knowledge

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:90%
of secret societies.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, secret societies,
magic, mystery,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:90%
all my favorite topics.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with this.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
I want to paint a cosmology
where there are Archons,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, Demigods,
whatever you want

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
to call these, principalities,
that essentially

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.727 align:middle line:84%
have domain or legion over
different regions of the world.

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And magicians throughout
history, let's say,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
have worked to curry favor
with them, oftentimes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with a
political or economic elite.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that your reality?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM WASSERMAN: You know,
it's an excellent question.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:10%
And it is certainly a reality.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It's been believed by countless
people over millennia.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a brilliant
thing, and I do

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:84%
believe that that
actually occurs.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask
if it's my reality,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
the answer is no, you know.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the spiritual
pursuit and the powers

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
from the level of
enlightenment or Gnosticism,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the quest for unity
with the divine.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not merely a matter
of manipulating power,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
but that is going
on all the time.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, so the point
is that you can, I mean,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
this kind of gets
to the question

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
of, as a student of magic,
is this what distinguishes

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
black from white
magic essentially,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
is this notion of currying
favor for your own empowerment?

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN:
Absolutely, and also

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
lacking a concern for
the well-being of others.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if, you
know, Crowley says

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
a magician who is doing
his will is unstoppable.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
He has the inertia of the
universe to assist him.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, your will can't
be in contradiction

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to someone else's will
because we are here

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:90%
for a grander purpose.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.765 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, you
mentioned Crowley, I mean,

00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
Crowley a bit later.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.806 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want to
start by asking,

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
would you consider
yourself a pagan?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Are there many gods?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.735 align:middle line:90%
Are you monotheistic?

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that there
is sort of one creator, one

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.924 align:middle line:84%
source, and maybe that
creator is vying with,

00:03:00.924 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
not vying with, but let's say,
contending with dark forces

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, devils, things
that are more materialistic

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.596 align:middle line:90%
or let's say ego-driven?

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Or do you believe
that there is no god?

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
It's all mental.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: I call
myself a pagan monotheist.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
is like one energy

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:90%
at the root of all creation.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And that energy, that
deity, that being, whatever

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it is, it is certainly not
something I can describe,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:84%
has many facets, like a
jewel or a diamond, you know.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's like all over the
place, and he shows us,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
or it shows us different
aspects and allows

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
us to interact with different
aspects all the time.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So there is the warrior
aspect, and there

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
is this scholar aspect, and
there's the lover aspect.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these can
be approached directly

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
by an aspirant, by someone
who is looking for it.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But does, do, are they
independent beings whose wills

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:90%
can be opposed to that being?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so, and I think
that evil is part of that

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So in a sense,
what you would say,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that evil is necessary
towards would you

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
say overall consciousness,
the chemical idea

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that basically all
darkness, all black

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
is part of these overall
crafting of the spirit?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through,
certain people are just

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.061 align:middle line:84%
at different levels
of consciousness,

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and they have to go
through forms of evil

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately find that purity,
the truth, the goodness.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: I would
say, absolutely,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
that's what I believe.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would also add,
unfortunately, you

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
know, so much
suffering in the world

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and you know the
heartache of reality.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, evil and anxiety are our
two biggest problems, you know.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it starts out from
being these kind of naked, smart

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:84%
guys, running around the caves,
all these gigantic furry beasts

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
are kind of like plodding
after us, looking for lunch,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
How'd that happen?

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no
wonder we're so uptight.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, so
speaking of the evil,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
obviously there are things
that we would consider evil,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
There's things,
abuse of children,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
there's harm to others in
a terrible tragic sense.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense, there's also
the evil and the dangers,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I think, that also come from
the magical position, let's

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
say, the practice
of magic, right.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Don't you during the course
of magic encounter entities

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that could be described
as evil or that

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
create evil or very chaotic
destructive conditions?

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: You
encounter temptations.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
working, some people

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are working a lot
with, you know,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
goetic or negative
energies, you know.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
am not doing that.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But there is a flipside
to every positive energy,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and I have certainly
encountered that a lot.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed,
experienced, and dealt

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
with literal demonic possession.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The most evil
experience I ever had

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
was actually standing
in, encountering someone

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
in a hotel bathroom,
believe it or not,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
who was a very, very, very
wealthy, wealthy guy, who

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:90%
owned the hotel.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
My uncle worked for him,
and I went to the hotel

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:90%
to visit my uncle.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And this guy had such a depth--

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I only met him for like
a second, you know--

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
had such a depth
of darkness in him

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that it still frightens
me to even think of it.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was a guy
dressed in a suit,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, smiled
at me or something,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
in the way that people pass
each other in the bathroom,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was, but there
was a darkness and emptiness

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
at his core, a kind of
grasping that Crowley

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
describes as the characteristic
of a black brother.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: You know, the
most evil force, he or she

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
who has rejected all love, all
sense of unity and purpose,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and this guy had that,
and it was weird.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a magical ceremony.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't in a temple with
candlelight, you know.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It was in day to day life,
and I've never forgotten it.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you mentioned
demonic possession.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.784 align:middle line:84%
Have you experienced it
through you or you've

00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:90%
seen it in others?

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: I have
seen it in others.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.047 align:middle line:84%
I've actually
fought it in others.

00:07:39.047 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But you've never
seen a demon, let's

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:84%
say, materializing in the
smoke, like in a form of smoke,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
let's say, or physical form.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Erm, not
exactly in that way,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.586 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, no,
no, quite honestly.

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we speak, we're
speaking about evil,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned
Crowley, obviously,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.706 align:middle line:84%
who is the founder of the
OTO, right, the Ordo Templi

00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Orientis, as far
as he adopted it

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and basically you recrafted it.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:04.605 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Into the new form.

00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Now many people
would say the OTO is satanic.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
How would you refute
that argument?

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.816 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Well,
to be satanic,

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%
you have to be a Christian.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
You immediately have to set
up a dichotomy between God

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and the devil, and we don't.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So we could be
described, you know,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I have been characterized
as, in fact, a luciferian,

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, a worshipper
of the lord of light.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
And that's a characterization
I don't dispute.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The idea of rebellion
is something

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:90%
that I find very appealing.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you were, I've
heard you say about the need

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to look within and to break
through all your conditioning

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to find truth, you're
not going to find truth

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
by living in the world that
your parents made for you.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:90%
That's just not how we do it.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do it from
my parents' world,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and my kids aren't
doing it from my world.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They're making
their own choices,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:90%
discovering their own realities.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing the same spiritually.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.582 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: We are not
satanic, not by a long shot.

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:11.382 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, so you're saying breaking
through and deprogramming,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
deconditioning,
is that the reason

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
for the various
degrees of initiation?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The idea that
oftentimes we read,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.846 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the
initiatory tract,

00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
someone learns
something in one degree,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
evolves to the next
degree and it negates what

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:90%
was taught previously, right.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.791 align:middle line:84%
Is this meant to basically
break down our conditioning?

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that the
hierarchical degree structure

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of initiation is meant
to do is to test a person

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and to give an ethical reading
of that person's behavior

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
People will come on and they'll
be very warm and open and just

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:90%
kind of cool.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
you know, in two years,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
they're doing something
absolutely horrific.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you've
given them degrees

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
over like a year at
a time or something,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to get too far
before they expose themselves

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
for the people that
they truly are,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and then we can get rid of them.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.989 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, you
know, you've obviously

00:10:13.989 --> 00:10:16.154 align:middle line:84%
been infatuated with Crowley
your whole life, right.

00:10:16.154 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, going back to what
would you say, was it--

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: At the
age of 18 or 19.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.592 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Was it "The Book of
Lies," "The Book of Truth"?

00:10:23.592 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: For me,
it was a book called

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:84%
"Magick in Theory and
Practice," you know,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was so weird
because I had just

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
been exposed so I
just like, I read it,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and I read it all
the way through.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, I didn't
understand a word of this.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I read the whole
thing through again,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and I was about 19, and
it was the first time

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever done that, read
a book through again.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I felt as if
I understood a little more,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and I just couldn't shake it.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It is the most intelligent
thing I'd ever read,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
the most challenging,
and the most spiritually

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
sustaining in a sense.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
almost felt like it

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:90%
was being written for me.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: You know.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so Crowley's
very much a conundrum.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, frankly, obviously, you
can't really put him in a box.

00:11:15.163 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
He's in a certain
sense, he's a joker.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
In a certain sense, you know,
he does proclaim himself

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
to be the great beast, right.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.892 align:middle line:84%
He does talk about
blood sacrifice.

00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
He basically takes you
through various forms of magic

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
so he's obviously
a scholar of magic.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways,
it seems to me,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.392 align:middle line:84%
that he went both
dark and light.

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you reconcile
this conundrum

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day?

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
You see him as ultimately
a positive force, someone

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
who's processing this coming
aeon that we're entering,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
this New Age, the Aquarian
Age, or Age of Horus.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that the way you see him?

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Yeah, I definitely
see him as a prophet.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I see him as the prophet of
the new aeon without question.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I know that all of the things
you just said are true.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that he
dabbled in the black,

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and he dabbled in the white.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe he did a lot more
on the white side of things

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:90%
than the black.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I know that he counseled
us to constantly seek

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:84%
to discover the truth of
who we are, why we are,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and what we believe to
be the next right action.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
"Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the law"

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
means that there is only
one thing that you will

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole of the law at the
very time that you're doing it.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're not doing
that one thing,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:90%
you are breaking the law.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You are committing
a spiritual error.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So by telling us to
do that, his dabbling,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
his various personal
quirks, personality quirks,

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have the problem in
the OTO where a lot of people

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
think that his kind of
sexual behavior is something

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that everybody must
emulate, you know.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's really funny because
people don't realize

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:90%
that he wasn't doing it for us.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
He was doing it
for him, you know.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
He was working through
his own issues.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.283 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: We're working
through our own issues,

00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be
different for each one of us,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to
model ourselves on

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is the fervor with which he
conducted his own version

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
of the great work.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What I want to
ask you today, obviously,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
the great work, that is
the pinnacle of alchemy,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
if I'm correct, right, this
idea of this transformation.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now do you think
that he ultimately

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
succeeded in transforming
himself, transcending himself?

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think at
the end of his life,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day
he failed as a magician

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the great work?

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: No, I think
he succeeded in real time.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he did
the best that he could,

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and he achieved as much as
he could before he died.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
When we say or when he
said or when actually I

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
was the person who dictated or
the intelligence that dictated

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of the Law" said,
"Do what thou wilt shall

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
be the whole of
the law," he talked

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
about an ever-evolving
continuity, you know.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So am I going to die
and have accomplished

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the great work, am I going to be
this for sort of perfect being

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
who rises in the heavens,
I mean, it'd be fun,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:90%
but I don't think so.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But I do think I will have done
the best job Jim Wasserman can

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
do, despite my failings,
despite the many times I didn't

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
do everything I might
better have been able to do.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.162 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the same with Crowley.

00:14:43.162 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do you feel a past
life connection to Crowley

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
or something, there's
obviously some pull to you

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to want to continue
this tradition.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: I've
certainly thought of that,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and you know, it may
or may not be true.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not the important issue.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:84%
What's important to me
is that the pull that I

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
have toward this teaching
is just profound, you know.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It works for me, and I've seen
it work in the lives of others,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
enough to know that
it's legitimate.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I also know it's
not for everybody.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
it's not for everybody

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.004 align:middle line:84%
means it's even more legitimate,
you know what I mean?

00:15:26.004 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I think that's what
scares people oftentimes.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But now, in terms of, let's
talk about the Necronomicon

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
for a second because this is
such a fascinating subject

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
for people who are familiar with
the "Evil Dead" movies, right,

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the fact that this is the
book that, you know, Lovecraft

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:84%
apparently, you know, invents
in his fantasy literature,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
right, the idea that
the Book of Dead names

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of ancient
Babylonian, Sumerian text,

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.835 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:15:51.835 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The mad Arab comes
across in the desert,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's able to open portals
to these ancient gods,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.302 align:middle line:84%
let them in, and basically they
want to come back and destroy

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.509 align:middle line:90%
the planet in a sense, right.

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:90%
They want blood.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They hate humans.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the Necronomicon
is it's a very dangerous book.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And then this, what
happens, you guys,

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
you end up publishing
what's called the "Simon

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Necronomicon," which
presumably could

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
be very dangerous for
people who want to practice.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, where did
this book come from?

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe this is
actually an ancient Babylonian

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:90%
or Sumerian text?

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Well,
what I believe

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:90%
is merely what I believe.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Simon stated to me that
it is, which is fine.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't dispute that.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't
totally accept it.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
What I think is that
if you look at it,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
it has all of the qualities of
a brilliantly-crafted Sumerian

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Babylonian grimoire.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It is effective,
it is consistent,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:90%
and it is practical.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I've known a lot of people
who have worked the system,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and you know, they've been
very impressed with it.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I myself have dealt extensively
with the spiritual energies

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.425 align:middle line:84%
that were raised by the
book, and I can tell you

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:17.212 align:middle line:90%
that they were real and scary.

00:17:17.212 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it
doesn't matter if it

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
was some ancient,
ancient thing or it

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:84%
brought some ancient thing
to life in the 20th century.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not a hoax,
that I can tell you.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: He brought you a text
that was in which language?

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: English.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So he brought
you a text in English.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Yes.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Now what makes you
believe that it was based

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:84%
on actual, like an ancient
text, from an ancient--

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Well, I have read
enough of the ancient texts

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:90%
to see where its roots are.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.474 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not, it didn't
come out of a vacuum.

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: So it wasn't--

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.681 align:middle line:84%
so they were, OK, I see, so
based on the ancient texts.

00:17:58.681 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Now who is Simon?

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you guys, this
is the biggest secret of all,

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
no one's allowed to see
who Simon really is.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.132 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Right, right.

00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But can you
tell us at all, like,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
what his background is
to make you believe him

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
as a credible source
for this book?

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Well,
he's a magician.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
He's a scholar.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:90%
He's a funny guy in his own way.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
He's, you know, brilliant.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:29.570 align:middle line:84%
He's well-- he's widely
read, widely practiced,

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and he's a perfect gentleman.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of ways, he
would be the ideal person

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to either write or cause to
be published and translated

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.946 align:middle line:90%
such a project.

00:18:44.946 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And why not
put his name on it,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
if he is a widely-respected
magician, at least respected

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
by people who
practice the craft.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: I think he also
has a great sense of humor.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Like Crowley.

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Like
Crowley and mystery.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Crowley used a lot of
pseudonyms, good lord.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.859 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having traveled
in the Middle East,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are plenty
of sorcerers and people

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that still interact
with what are called

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the jinns, the genies, right,
but basically practicing

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:90%
different forms of magic.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous
power to this region

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as far as the feeling of
portals and stargates, right.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.895 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Iraq was Sumeria.

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
That was always a question
about the Iraq invasion.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.519 align:middle line:84%
Was this the Americans
trying to get

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
a hold of certain stargates
and certain ancient literature,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
texts, right.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: I wish we were--

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Secrets.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.723 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Smart
enough to have done that.

00:19:33.723 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I don't
think America has the--

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, someone
raided the Baghdad Museum,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%
looted it and got those texts.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: And didn't protect
it from the rest of this stuff,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's like--

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So do you think
that it's possible

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki
of Sumerian lore

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
are essentially the entities
that are being encountered

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:90%
through this magic?

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
You've explored magic enough.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there is in
alien factor to the entities

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that you're encountering?

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Whether you
call it alien or alternate,

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.605 align:middle line:84%
I don't know really
what the difference is.

00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely
a life form that

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond what we, you and I
are sitting here talking about.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not on their level.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.454 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I believe
that they exist.

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Or could the
entities also potentially

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
be discarnate spirits, as
people talk about ghosts.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.874 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Well, yeah, but
ghosts are different though.

00:20:31.874 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts are sort of like
the carryovers of people,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:90%
their imperfections, you know.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They're the parts of
us that didn't quite

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:90%
make it to the next step.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: You know,
they're not ghosts.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah, these are--

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: They're archetypes.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.759 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah, they're ancient.

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, these are
ancient archetypes.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
These are interdimensional
beings, spirits,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:90%
you'd call them.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Yeah, and if we
call that alien, who knows.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What do you think
they want with human beings?

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.076 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: I don't know.

00:20:57.076 --> 00:20:57.876 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:20:57.876 --> 00:20:58.676 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.676 --> 00:21:01.444 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You've encountered,
you've practice magic.

00:21:01.444 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
You've encountered
these entities.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:90%
You've dealt with them.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.881 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Jinn and
genies in some form.

00:21:05.881 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: They don't ever expect,
you know, gifts in exchange.

00:21:09.892 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people talk about
the idea of blood sacrifice

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
because some of these
beings want blood.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
They want very dark things in
exchange for material gifts.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: My experience
has been that they want us

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:90%
as company, you know.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
rise to their level

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can join them in
this holy quest of becoming.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And my experience with them
has been quite positive.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they demand a great
deal as well they should.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: In terms of the quest,
the holy quest you talk about,

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
your new book is
about the Templars.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars have fascinated
people for hundreds of years

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
at this point because
a Templar seemed

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to have been incorporated
in some capacity

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:90%
into the modern-day Freemasons.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
the Templars

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
were persecuted, right,
by the Catholic church,

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:90%
by the French king.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
powerful at one time,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very strange
story of the Templars.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole idea of
nine knights who are basically

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
taking a vow to protect
Christians, you know,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
who are pilgrims.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It's implausible for
nine knights to do this.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.239 align:middle line:84%
And it's more likely that
they were in Jerusalem,

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and they were known
to be excavating.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
for ancient texts.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Is that your understanding
of what Templars were doing?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for maybe
ancient grimoires and things

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:90%
like this in Jerusalem?

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: That's
not, that's not

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
the particular understanding
that I have of them.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's almost disappointing.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could be one of
these speculative guys that

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
sort of jumps into
that particular realm.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
For me, they were, the
original founding knights

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:90%
were real serious Christians.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
They were not the
later Knights Templar

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that I write about
in my book, which

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:84%
took place a lot longer after
the original guys had died.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And they were tired of fighting.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
They had won the First
Crusade, and they

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:90%
wanted to take orders as monks.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They wanted the
patriarch of Jerusalem

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to accept them as monks,
give up the warrior creed.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And he and the king of
Jerusalem apparently

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:84%
convinced them that
it would be better

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to use their knightly skills
to help protect pilgrims.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you say, there's
nine people against 200

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.265 align:middle line:84%
or people attacking
the pilgrims.

00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but they can organize.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They were nine leaders,
and they understood

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:90%
strategy and tactics.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
They understood danger points.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They understood what to
look for in the enemy, how

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
he or she was, how, well, he
was moving through territory

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and where the
pilgrims were coming

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.227 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
routes and dangers

00:24:10.227 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:90%
that they would encounter.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't sound
so implausible to me.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Even though
there were reports--

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Later
on, something happens.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Even though
there were reports

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that they were
excavating in Jerusalem.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
They were in the temples
and they were looking.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.663 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Wouldn't you?

00:24:20.663 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't surprise
me that they would.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
time on their hands.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.995 align:middle line:90%
They weren't always fighting.

00:24:28.995 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, I've heard
different reports.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I've heard reports that they
did encounter grimoires,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's what made them so
powerful as far as establishing

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:90%
this massive banking empire.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.317 align:middle line:84%
But so your focus was
more on what aspect,

00:24:39.317 --> 00:24:41.650 align:middle line:84%
at what point do they become
alchemists, because there's

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:84%
a lot of indication
of the Templars being,

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.974 align:middle line:84%
basically being part of
alchemical tradition in Europe.

00:24:47.974 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there
was, do you ultimately

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
say that there's
a temple heresy,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.944 align:middle line:84%
there's a Gnosticism
to the Templars.

00:24:53.944 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So where does this
originate from?

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.734 align:middle line:84%
Is that from, do
you believe it's

00:24:56.734 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
from the Islamic encounter
with the assassins, is that it?

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Or how does it, how
did the Templars

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%
basically become heretics?

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
How did they become more
gnostic in their thinking,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:90%
at what point?

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: What I've done
in "The Templar Heresy"

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is create a very practical,
almost totally plausible

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
encounter between an individual
Templar, who is a diplomat,

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and an assassin master,
who becomes his teacher.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he was a
young guy with questions

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:90%
like all young guys have.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And this guy showed
him a world of mystery

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that began to unfold within him,
despite the fact that it broke

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
through all the conditioning
of his Catholicism,

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:84%
his European background, and
even to some extent his loyalty

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.775 align:middle line:90%
to the Templars.

00:25:55.775 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It threw him into that
tailspin of knowledge

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:90%
that we've all experienced.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I believe in the
elite group within the Templar

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.579 align:middle line:90%
order developed.

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I've never thought it
was all the Templars.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, no,
no, I understand.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So this book is
obviously a fiction.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Yes.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But the idea is that
this is based on your research.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jay from Colorado
asks a question,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:90%
going to our audience.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:10%
Jay asks, since "there are
rumors that the Knights

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:10%
Templar converted to
Islam in the Middle East,"

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:10%
was this based on their
interaction with the assassins

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:10%
or some type of
Sufi-style sects?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>WASSERMAN: Right, and then
it's hard to understand what

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:10%
Islam is because certainly the
assassins and the Sufis are not

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:10%
exactly Muslims the way--

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: Either Shia,
I mean, the assassins

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:10%
were basically a
Shia sect, right.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: But they were a
far off the radar Shia sect.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty
far from the Shia

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
by the time the
Templars met them.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
They incorporated a great
deal of paganism in their--

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Cosmology.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN:
Absolutely, absolutely,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were a very advanced,
they were far closer to Sufis

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:90%
than they were to Muslims.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Yeah, but Sufis
are still Muslims.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
They just have different
understanding--

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because all the problem
with Islam, and obviously

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
like any religion like
Christianity, Judaism,

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is how much are you going
to base it on tradition, how

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
much on various
texts, there's law,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
there's precedent, there's
obviously different sources,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, that every
religion has to grapple with.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
What I present in the
book is what I firmly

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:84%
believed happened, which
is, you know, Gnosticism.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that
between the Templars

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and the Cathars
and the Assassins,

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
they all influenced each
other in their growth,

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
the way spiritual
people always do

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
when they communicate
toward the next step

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:90%
in their enlightenment.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So in the whole, I mean,
as a student of Gnosticism,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
as a student of Crowley
and spirituality and magic,

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.702 align:middle line:84%
do you think that we are
entering the Age of Crowley,

00:28:05.702 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, where everything
will be permitted?

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
What is the future looking
like in this new age?

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Right now, it looks
a little nutty, doesn't it?

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, I think
we will learn new values,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to be explored.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
going to be tested,

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and there are truths that
supersede the questions.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And once we discover
those truths, again,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
with clarity in our
own minds, I think

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
establish morals and norms

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and dogmas even that propound
a certain kind of behavior.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:90%
How do you raise kids, you know?

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you teach values?

00:28:55.150 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of that stuff,
man is a teaching race.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:90%
We instruct our young.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
We grow our
consciousness together.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
We have cultures.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:90%
We have societies.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We have our differences,
thank goodness, you know.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.732 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: Of course, of course.

00:29:12.732 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:10%
But you wouldn't say
you're an immoralist

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the day.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.150 align:middle line:10%
You're not someone
who is opposed

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.440 align:middle line:10%
to any kind of moral structure.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a question,
it's about questioning

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.865 align:middle line:84%
and reassessing and
finding our own moralities.

00:29:20.865 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:21.855 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:29:21.855 --> 00:29:23.438 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What you're
ultimately saying?

00:29:23.438 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Absolutely.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, Crowley called
"Do what thou wilt"

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:10%
the most austere ethical
precept ever uttered,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.734 align:middle line:10%
despite its apparent license.

00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of what
I said to you earlier.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you're
doing the one thing,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the "Book of the
Law" says, thou hast

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
no right but to do thy will.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, it
basically puts the onus

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.755 align:middle line:84%
and their responsibility
on the individual.

00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Yes.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Which I think--

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: That's
the difference.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's what
people oftentimes miss,

00:29:50.318 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes use religion
as a crutch to say,

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:90%
that's ultimately up to God.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It's up to a Savior.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:90%
It's up to a priest.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's up to someone to
intervene, whereas the practices

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that you're discussing, that
are oftentimes called satanic,

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
are simply saying, no, it's
about empowering the human

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.085 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility for our
actions and the consequence

00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:09.100 align:middle line:90%
thereof.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WASSERMAN: Taking
responsibility

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect
statement for Thelema.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Beautiful.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.145 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me today, Jim.

00:30:18.145 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I Really appreciate your time.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.448 align:middle line:90%
>>WASSERMAN: Thank you, Sean.

00:30:20.448 --> 00:30:21.966 align:middle line:90%
It's been great.

00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there you have
it, folks, some great insights

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.211 align:middle line:90%
from Jim Wasserman.

00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:10%
today, but I do urge you
to check out his website,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.710 align:middle line:10%
studio31.com for his work.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:84%
along the buzzsaw's edge, and it
requires constant reassessment.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.942 align:middle line:90%
