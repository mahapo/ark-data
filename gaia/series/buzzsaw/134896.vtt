and salute the false flag.

Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Welcome to Buzzsaw,
where we cut through

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream narrative to
explore the hidden truths.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.894 align:middle line:10%
And joining me today
is Richard Dolan, one

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
of the world's leading
researchers and writers

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of UFOs.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
He is the author of "UFOs and
the National Security State,"

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:10%
and "UFOs for the
21st Century Mind."

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
He also hosts a weekly radio
program, "The Richard Dolan

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Show."

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Today he enlightens us on his
research for his next book

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
on false flags.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start by
asking you about a bit

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:90%
of the history of false flags.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Because as I
understand it, it has

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to do with a lot of the pirate
raiding and marauding that

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
took place, for example, in
the 16th and 17th centuries.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.692 align:middle line:84%
Is that really the origin
of that word, that concept?

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>> RICHARD DOLAN: Yes, it is.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:10%
That's the origin of
the phrase false flag.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And back in that
period of time, pirates

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:10%
would collect flags of
other nations, the UK

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.057 align:middle line:10%
or the Netherlands or
France or whatever.

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that would
be effective for luring

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
commercial vessels toward them.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.499 align:middle line:84%
And what would
always happen is when

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
the prey would get close
enough, the pirates would then

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.051 align:middle line:84%
hoist up the black pirate
flag and rob the ship, which

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
is interesting to me,
because it really shows me

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that pirates had more honor
about what they did back then

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.882 align:middle line:84%
than false flag
operations do today.

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Because at least back then,
you knew that the pirates

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:90%
were stealing your goods.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But wasn't there
also, even back then,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the use of pirates
by governments?

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, governments
utilizing false flags

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to engage in wars, for example?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: There's some limited
evidence of ancient or really

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:90%
early false flags.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.797 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, it's very possible
that false flags can go back

00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
even a couple of thousand
years, although the evidence--

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to be honest with you,
I've looked into this.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It's quite spotty.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.544 align:middle line:84%
When I initially started my
research into false flags,

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and searching out on the
web and in various sources,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I was willing to accept the
claim, as many people had said,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that false flags go
back to ancient times.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.862 align:middle line:84%
Some people would cite the
burning of Rome by Nero,

00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and blaming that
on the Christians.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, maybe.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But the more I looked into these
early alleged or possible false

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:84%
flags, the more I realized that
even if some of them did occur,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
they were outliers.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And there is a reason for this.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The ancient world--
it would be difficult,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I think, in pragmatic
terms, to, say, fake

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:90%
an attack by another country.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas today, certain
nations have that ability.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
What I'm looking at in my
research on false flags

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
is this is a phenomenon
that really takes off

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
after the First World War,
and for very specific reasons.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of these reasons
is that much of the world

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%
was militarized after that war.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge event.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, there were
several governments

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that came into total control
of their state media.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, is
a very important factor

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
with false flags.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
If a government or an
intelligence agency

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to do
something terrible,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
like blow things up and
kill people and blame it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
on another party-- and
that is a false flag-- then

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
they need to have control of
the narrative that gets out.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a kind of
centralized media system that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:90%
exists that they can dominate.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
After the First
World War, we see

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
this with nations
like Germany and Japan

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and the Soviet Union,
who, in the 1930s,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
were really the
leaders in perpetrating

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
certain false
flags at that time.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You mentioned Germany,
Japan, and Soviet Union.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
These false flags
in the 1930s, they

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
were instrumental towards
the buildup to World War II,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yes.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They absolutely were,
because those three nations--

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the other thing
about perpetrating

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
false flags is that
the perpetrator needs

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to have a motivation
for some kind

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
of either major
geopolitical change, which

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
those nations
absolutely all three

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
of them had, or significant
domestic change.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Because a false flag can be
used for international purposes

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:90%
or for domestic purposes.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all three
of those nations,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
particularly Germany
and the Soviet Union,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
did international and
domestic false flags

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
Germany famously.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:10%
The Reichstag fire
in 1933, which

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:10%
was really their
9/11, which was what

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:10%
gave Hitler dictatorial power.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Before the Reichstag fire,
Hitler was a chancellor.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
He was like a prime minister.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have dictator powers.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
After the Reichstag
fire, he did.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
This was an event that--
it's been more than 80 years,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and one of the interesting
things about it is to this day,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the majority of
historians of Germany

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
would acknowledge that
that was a false flag.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.955 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
who don't agree.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
historians who

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
maintain that it was indeed
set by a Dutch communist named

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Van der Lubbe on his own
and then used as a pretext

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
for creating a fascist state.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.666 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
was a Nazi set up.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are very good
reasons for believing that.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
But my point is this.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis were so
good at this covert op

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that more than 80 years
later there is still

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
some question as to who did it.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
difficulty, in some cases,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
of researching
these false flags.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do not
get an acknowledgement

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.092 align:middle line:84%
from the government,
an official admission,

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:90%
then where are you left with?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You're left with good
journalism and using

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
your own common sense.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well,
and in US history,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we have very interesting
episodes of false flags.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.857 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Oh, yes.

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Beginning even
with the Boston Tea Party,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
because obviously, we know
that it was the colonists who

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.902 align:middle line:84%
basically were dumping
the tea from the ships.

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But they were dressed up as
Native Americans, which--

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Exactly.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --whether or not that
was just in fun or actually

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.927 align:middle line:84%
intended to be a false
flag, or disguise--

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: A little of Column
A and a little of Column B,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Precisely.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.771 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the
origin of US history.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yeah.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious to those people
dumping the tea overboard

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that they knew that the
British knew that it was them.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: So by that
point in American history,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:84%
the tensions between the
colonists and the British

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.557 align:middle line:90%
government were very high.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It was very obvious
what was going on.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They did dress up as Native
Americans in disguise

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But obviously some
very important false flags in US

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
history, like the sinking
of the Maine, which--

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.157 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned the press.

00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The Hearst press was
all over the idea

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:90%
the Spanish had done it.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And then thereafter
many wars, it seems,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
have been incited by
it in the US history.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Right.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
The sinking of the
Maine, that's 1898.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a lot of
time looking into that.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.392 align:middle line:90%
That was a tricky one.

00:06:56.392 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know exactly
where I come down on that,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.766 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you, Sean.

00:06:59.766 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
very good argument

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
to be made, that as
crazy as it would sound,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that some of the hidebound
Spanish colonial officers

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:84%
engaged in sabotage
of that ship.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
This was a USS ship,
the Maine, that

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:90%
was in Havana Harbor in 1898.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to me
that it was sabotage

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.645 align:middle line:90%
that took the Maine out.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely the case that
the United States used this

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
as the pretext,
the cause celebre,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to have a war against Spain
that led them to taking

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.099 align:middle line:90%
Cuba and the Philippines.

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is a claim that
it was Theodore Roosevelt who

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%
actually organized this.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have not seen any
evidence that this is the case.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not coming down that
that was a definite false flag.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.412 align:middle line:84%
If there were an
Olympics of false flags,

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the United States
would win that Olympics

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:84%
with the gold
medal far and away,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:84%
particularly after the end
of the Second World War.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So from the late 1940s,
early 1950s onward,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
false flags is the United
States' game, all the way.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what are the most
glaring examples that we can

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
say certainly were false flags?

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: Well, I mean, let's
just start with the most

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:90%
obvious.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I will say that
9/11 was a false flag.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
9/11 was a necessary false
flag from the point of view

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:90%
of the American ruling elite.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the first false flag.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
practice before then.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
For people who still doubt
about 9/11 as a false flag,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
let's refer them to
a planned false flag

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that never happened, which
many people are aware of,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
called Operation Northwoods,
which was cooked up

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
by the Joint Chiefs
of Staff in 1962,

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:90%
landed on John F Kennedy's desk.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And this was a plan,
as insane as it

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
would sound, to have airliners
that would be ostensibly

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
hijacked by Cuba that
would crash into US targets

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
in major cities, including
New York City, blamed on Cuba,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to justify an invasion of Cuba.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.766 align:middle line:84%
So Kennedy looked at this,
and he said, no, we're

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:90%
not going to be doing this.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And that particular false
flag did not happen.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But the US-- you
know, let's look

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
at things like Operation Gladio,
or the cointel program run

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:90%
by the FBI in the 1950s and 60s.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Gladio was a European operation
run by NATO and CIA operatives,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
where-- now we know about this
most specifically in Italy--

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:84%
where operatives would
be there and blow up

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
train stations, killing hundreds
of people, blaming it on,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
in those days, not the Islamic
terrorists, but the communists.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:90%
There was one in 1980.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
The Bologna train station was
blown up, killing 85 people.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:90%
This was a Gladio operation.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the explicit
point of Gladio was

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.219 align:middle line:84%
to influence Italian
politics in the direction

00:09:48.219 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
of conservative politics
so that people would run

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:90%
to the state for protection.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.887 align:middle line:90%
Gladio was found out.

00:09:53.887 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's been discussed.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It's out there in the open.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
In the United States, COINTELPRO
was run out of the FBI

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
under J Edgar Hoover's days.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Was a classic kind
of provocation,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
which goes on to this day
under different names.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:15.014 align:middle line:84%
In those days, groups pushing
for positive social change,

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
whether they be the Black
Panthers or Students

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
for a Democratic
Society, were infiltrated

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
by FBI, who would have
people radicalizing the group

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and pushing it toward
violence, which would then

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
discredit that group.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And this was very successful.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.924 align:middle line:84%
The FBI was very
successful at that.

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And then that was found out.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Really dirty pool.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, a long part
of the American tradition.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think 9/11 was
absolutely the centerpiece

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.807 align:middle line:84%
of the modern era
of false flags.

00:10:43.807 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So you mentioned
Gladio, obviously,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.157 align:middle line:84%
which was centered
around Europe,

00:10:48.157 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and particularly Western Europe.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.198 align:middle line:84%
And these operations
that were oftentimes

00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
run by fascist elements,
blaming it on communists.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.037 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned before
Islam was the terror

00:10:58.037 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:90%
groups that were targeted.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have Islam as a major
focus for these terror attacks.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me wonder,
when we see events

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
like the Brussels or
the Paris attacks,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.912 align:middle line:84%
whether or not you believe
these could be false flags--

00:11:11.912 --> 00:11:12.711 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yes.

00:11:12.711 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --or they could perhaps
just instead be ultimately

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
working towards the same end,
even if it is really ISIS

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.968 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: Some of them
absolutely can be false flags.

00:11:20.968 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's get right down to it.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the history of Islam

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to false flags,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the United
States, Britain, and Israel

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
as three nations
each which provably

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
have cultivated Islamic
fundamentalist extremists

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:90%
for their purpose.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
Israel, back in 1950,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:84%
they were a false
flag in Iraq, bombings

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that were blamed on
Islamic extremists that

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.715 align:middle line:90%
were now attributed to Mossad.

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
that was to actually

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
frighten Jewish settlers
out of Iraq so that they

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:90%
would settle in Israel.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
The United States and Britain
cultivated, by the early 1950s,

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:90%
the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And the specific
reason for that was

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
against the Egyptian
government, Nasser,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:84%
which was a secular,
non-US-aligned government.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Nasser was a
Pan-Arabist who did not

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:84%
want to align with the
US or the Soviet Union.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
US policy was, no, we're
going to not have that.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And they cultivated
the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The US also cultivated Islamic
extremists in Afghanistan

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:90%
during the 1980s.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
We know all about this
under the Reagan years.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And in the former Yugoslavia,
during the late 1990s,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and then of course
in the Iraq war.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my goodness, in 2005 it
was a case of two British SAS

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
operatives-- these are
covert ops-- in Baghdad.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:90%
This is during the Iraq war.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:90%
They were dressed as jihadists.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:90%
They were heavily armed.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:90%
They looked Iraqi.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Baghdad police looked
at them, thinking

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:90%
they're very suspicious.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Arrested them.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:90%
There was a gunfight.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:90%
These two men were arrested.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were liberated in
a James Bond-like escape

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
attempt by US and
UK military forces

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
so that they would
not stand trial.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Why were British
UK SAS operatives

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:90%
dressed as jihadists?

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could
go on and on here.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But my point is that Islam,
whatever one says about

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it's progressive or not
in terms of modern politics,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
has been used as a
whipping boy by the West

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to further covert ops
and false flag agendas,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
to get people worked up
for their own purposes

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
against Islam, to
promote a basically

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
imperialist political agenda.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Right, and towards that
agenda, my question would be,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
what can we say or deduce
from these attacks that occur

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the actual
motivation from the financial

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
deep state perspective,
for example?

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Do these attacks then move
money into the national security

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
apparatus, into
perhaps a deep state

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.551 align:middle line:84%
component that really would
be behind the ultimate empire?

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Because most people would say,
look, the American government

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.687 align:middle line:84%
itself is not necessarily
running the conspiracy any more

00:14:09.687 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
than the UK government itself
is running the conspiracy.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.486 align:middle line:84%
But there is a deep
state component, right,

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:90%
I would argue, that exists.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yes.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.861 align:middle line:90%
I'm inclined to agree with this.

00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So where is the ultimate
power involved in all of this?

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.912 align:middle line:90%
Is it the US government alone?

00:14:24.912 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't believe so.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it the US government
in conjunction

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
with global top level
financial power?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I would say yes.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So the US military, which is
the most dominant military

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in the world by
far, is considered

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to be the ultimate tool for the
use of these financial elites

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%
to achieve what they want.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.926 align:middle line:84%
Let's just put it
right out there.

00:14:48.926 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
They are stealing the
entire planet from right

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:90%
before our eyes.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.945 align:middle line:84%
You have this many people
owning everything that is worth

00:14:56.945 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
owning, all the water, all
the genetically modified foods

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that they want us
to eat forever,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
all of the minerals under
the ground, everything.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And they're going for it.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're using
the United States

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
as the most dominant political
and military power in the world

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to achieve those ends,
and to do regime change

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and false flags against
nations that are not on board,

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the US political
establishment

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is benefiting greatly from
this, as are the US close allies

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:90%
and NATO allies and so forth.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So they all have a motivation
for continuing on with this.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And they do this,
incidentally, by domination

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
over global mainstream
media, which is

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
critically important for them.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
This would not be
possible if they

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
didn't have total domination
over-- whether it's

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
CNN or BBC or all the
other major networks which

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:90%
work for them.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So we talk about
the global financial elite,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and their reach and control
is far beyond, I think,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:90%
most people's imagining.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Do we then look at these false
flags and other tensions,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:84%
even tensions between countries
like the United States

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and Russia, as theatrics
that are ultimately

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
designed for population
control, that being mostly

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
of one's own population?

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Is that the ultimate goal?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.176 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: So are you asking
if the tensions between the US

00:16:14.176 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and Russia are manufactured
in an artificial way?

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.242 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: I don't know.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.731 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I don't believe so.

00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I've gone back and forth
on this over the years.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
My opinion on this right now
is that Russia is genuinely

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
outside the system overall.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Russia and China both
are separate factors.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And the United States bloc, the
US / EU / NATO bloc / IMF bloc,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
is seeking to dominate Russia
and China because they are not

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.039 align:middle line:90%
particularly on board.

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the US is
engaged in a covert war

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
against Russia, particularly.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle line:84%
So my take on it
right now is that this

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
is why we're seeing all this
mess in places like Syria,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The US has undermined Syria
through its covert ops

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and its jihadists, as has
the UK, to dismantle Syria,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.814 align:middle line:84%
in part because Syria is
an ally of Iran and Russia.

00:17:06.814 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the
global geopolitical struggle

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:90%
against Russia.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And so
towards that end,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
if we believe that the elite
of the West in particular are

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
aiming for like a one world
order as much as possible,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
financially, politically--

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yes.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --in order
to achieve that,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
one thing that has been
postulated over the years is

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
a false flag involving
an alien invasion, right,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
as one means of trying to unify
all people on the planet under

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:90%
their rule.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.809 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: Well, I've studied the
UFO phenomenon for many years,

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very familiar
with this idea.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's been
called Project Blue Beam

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
as like a fake alien invasion.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a believer
in that theory.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I find the logistics of
faking an alien invasion

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:90%
to be way beyond anything.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Even 9/11 pales in comparison.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.529 align:middle line:84%
Convincing a not only skeptical
but hostile international

00:17:58.529 --> 00:18:00.320 align:middle line:84%
scientific community
that this is happening

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
is a bridge too far.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
However, I do see
a possibility as,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
let us say, what
people call disclosure,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
that is the disclosure
of a UFO reality

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that that could, in
the future, be used

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of false flag, yes.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
My way of looking
at it is as follows.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a tremendous
amount of UFO data

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that is being held by the US
National Security apparatus,

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and enormous mountains of it.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
If they ever are to disclose
this, I can assure you,

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
it will not be all of it.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It will not be all of that data.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It will be a sliver, a
very, very distinct sliver

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that will be used,
as the US always

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
does, for propaganda and spin,
so to further their agenda.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.226 align:middle line:84%
This is why I think any
kind of US disclosure,

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:47.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's President Obama or
Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.355 align:middle line:90%
even, would be a disaster.

00:18:50.355 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I would much rather see a
disclosure by another country--

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: --that would not
be US, to be honest with you.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that could
be a kind of false flag,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:90%
if the US were to do it.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What do you make, then,
of the disclosures on Secret

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:90%
space program activities?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
this is ultimately

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
toward serving the
US agenda of power,

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
or do you actually
think there is evidence

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that there is a Secret
Space program that exists?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.378 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: I believe there's a
lot of evidence that there is

00:19:15.378 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
a Secret Space program, a
clandestine program in space,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that I think has
existed for many years.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I've talked and written
about this myself many times.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I would caution people to
be careful about listening

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
to every alleged
whistleblower on this subject.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, my approach
in looking at this

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
is to find a way to confirm
who whistleblowers are,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.444 align:middle line:90%
to confirm their background.

00:19:42.444 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There are people
in this world who

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
are confirmable whistleblowers.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:90%
A fellow like Gary McKinnon.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:90%
We know who Gary McKinnon is.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
He did break into the US space
command website many years ago

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and found information.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.494 align:middle line:90%
We know all about that.

00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
There are other whistleblowers,
like William Binney,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:90%
who I consider a great hero.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:90%
We know all about him.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't talked about
the Secret Space program,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
but he's a genuine
whistleblower.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So there are people whose
backgrounds we can identify,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and others whose
backgrounds we cannot.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I simply try to be
careful about who I would

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:90%
accord whistleblower status.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the space
program as it potentially

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
exists, we have seen recently,
over the last few years

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in particular, NASA
budgets seem to be cut.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And yet we see more of
this privatization--

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Oh, yeah.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: --space program.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.681 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
how it's now operating?

00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Is more the private
sector taking over?

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: In a way, yes.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
the United States,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
militarily and geopolitically,
must dominate space.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
This is not arguable.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The United States
can never win a war

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
unless they dominate space
as the ultimate platform.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:84%
None of the precision
bombers would

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
work without having
the satellites up there

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to tell them where to go.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So the US must be assured
of domination over space.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the necessary
theater of operations.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So that means if
they're going to cut

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
the outward civilian
space operation,

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:84%
you can be sure that they are
militarizing space to the max.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%
All of this is clandestine.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
All of that, by itself,
is a Secret Space program,

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
if you want to get
right down to it.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
The real question that
some of us are asking

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is, is there exotic technology
that is beyond anything that we

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
officially acknowledge
in our world today, that

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
is a component of the
Secret Space program?

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And my strong suspicion
is that, yes, there is.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is through
my years looking

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
into the UFO phenomenon.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I am someone who
credits the idea that there

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
has been exotic technology
recovered that has been studied

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and that has not been released
to the mainstream world,

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
except in so far that
it can be made profit.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But there are other technologies
that I think are vastly beyond.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, if we
know that the Russians--

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: That's my speculation.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Sure.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But if we know that the
Russians, the Chinese,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
the Indians, are now
engaging more and more

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
in space-based
activities and probes,

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're interested in
manning missions to the moon

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and to Mars as
well, does that mean

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're also aware of
the Secret Space program?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: I think that they are.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.677 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are also aware
of the greater UFO reality.

00:22:16.677 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I'm sure that they are.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Russia absolutely has
its own long history,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
confirmed history, of
military encounters with UFOs.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:90%
China, we know less about China.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But the research we have
points to yes, absolutely,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:90%
China as well.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The real interesting
question for me

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:84%
is, as we move forward
here, you know,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
the United States can
take care of its allies.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:90%
The US dominates them.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
They are essentially varying
levels of vassal states.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Russia and China are wild cards.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And the question
that I asked myself,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have the answer
too, is will we get to a point

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
where Russia or
China will reveal

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
something that's not
in the US playbook

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the world.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
interesting questions moving

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that both
of those nations

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
have their own reasons
for not disclosing.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Because disclosure
of a UFO reality

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:90%
is a highly disruptive thing.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It really opens up a lot
of uncomfortable issues

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:90%
in terms of energy.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
After all, if you disclose
that there's this other reality

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.091 align:middle line:84%
here, these other
beings, I think

00:23:21.091 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
it would be all of five
minutes before people realize,

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, they're probably
not using petroleum

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to go from here to there.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that answer
is, it's something beyond,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and that leads us to a post
petroleum global paradigm.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.924 align:middle line:84%
And that's a radical change
for everyone, not just the US.

00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, you spoke about
the militarization of space

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%
as one agenda.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you also think that there
is a desire by the elite

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
to create a breakaway
civilization,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
either on other planets
or basically just

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.555 align:middle line:84%
a space based
breakaway civilization?

00:23:48.555 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: It's interesting.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.263 align:middle line:84%
The breakaway
civilization is a phrase

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:90%
that I coined many years ago.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:90%
And I see it's out there now.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
My take on a
breakaway civilization

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of a black budget
community on steroids,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Ultra-secret with a lot of
infinite amount of money

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and highly exotic
technology thrown

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
into the mix that
would allow them

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to have radical science and
therefore radical experiences

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.769 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of us are
prevented from having.

00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
That would give them
a different cosmology,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
a different
civilization, one that's

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.931 align:middle line:90%
broken away from our own.

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You're asking is there
a kind of let's say

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:84%
an alternative three
type of scenario

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
where they're going off of
earth living permanently

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:90%
on another base?

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say in my own
analysis of previous leaks

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
from who I believe are credible
whistleblowers going back

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
decades, that there
is reason to believe

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that there are anomalies on
the moon and maybe even Mars.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't discredit these ideas.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there's very likely
something that could be beyond.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
My contention, though, is
that the action is on Earth.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So that whatever is
going on, I think

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.147 align:middle line:84%
it's happening here
more than anywhere else.

00:25:08.147 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
This is where the population is.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:90%
This is where the resources are.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
This is where all the fun is.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:90%
It's here on Earth.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And if there are other
beings, they're here too.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Earth is where it's at.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Not the moon, not
Mars, in my opinion.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So in terms
of the not NASA,

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:84%
because obviously we see that
there have been cutbacks taking

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:84%
place recently in NASA, but many
people obviously calling out

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the origins of NASA, relating in
relationship to Nazi scientists

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
that were brought over
at the end of the war,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
certain Nazi symbolism
within NASA lore.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.907 align:middle line:84%
And it has an occult
element within it.

00:25:46.907 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that's always
been interesting to me

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
is that you mentioned
9/11 as a false flag,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
how the NASA role has not really
been studied or looked at,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
but it was a potential
player in the attack,

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:02.104 align:middle line:84%
if the attack involved any level
of advanced energy weaponry,

00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
right, and potentially even a
space based energy weaponry.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Have you looked at that--?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.789 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: This is interesting.

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And these would be theories of
individuals like Dr. Judy Wood.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.629 align:middle line:84%
And I will just say, you
know, it took me a while

00:26:13.629 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to get on board with some
of what she was saying,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
because her theory--
she's over in the UK,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and I think she's
very brilliant.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.902 align:middle line:90%
She asks a simple question.

00:26:22.902 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the title of
one of her books.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Where did the towers go?

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And what she means
is when you watch

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the-- I used to say collapse
of the World Trade Center,

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a collapse.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
It is essentially
a disintegration,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:90%
a dustification.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can go on
YouTube and look,

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and you can watch vertical
steel beams essentially

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
vanish as the World Trade
Center is coming down.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I simply ask, and she asks,
how is this even possible?

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:90%
How is it possible?

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one thing to have
a building come down in a fire

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:90%
and have damage.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing for
vertical steel columns,

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
thick steel columns, to just
vanish before our very eyes.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a question I don't
know if any scientist,

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
any physicist, has
tried to explain this.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And so how do we explain it?

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are some
unconventional--

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
there's the nano-thermite
explanation that's

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:90%
been put out there.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.247 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that that can
do it, though, frankly.

00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there's what Judy
Wood talks about, which

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:90%
is advanced beam type weaponry.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I must
say, I mean, I've

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
come to the point where I think
that her-- 9/11 researchers are

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:90%
terrified of this idea.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because 9/11 researchers
want-- you know,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
they've got one albatross
around their neck already.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
They have a corporate
mainstream media

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that just says, oh, you're all
crazy conspiracy theorists.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Now to take that and to add
on something even more exotic,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:84%
this advanced beam
weaponry of which

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:84%
there is no proof officially,
but which it sure as heck looks

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't want that.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
here's Judy Wood,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and she's putting the
evidence out there.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at that evidence.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So my point is, I
don't know exactly

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
who the source of that
beam weaponry might be

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or if it's beam weaponry
or something else.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say that, yes,
an honest intellectual analysis

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of the destruction of
the World Trade Center

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:90%
has to account for this.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And, again, in
terms of the NASA component,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.295 align:middle line:84%
even though really it hasn't
been thoroughly investigated

00:28:32.295 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to 9/11, as I
mentioned the Nazi relationship

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.322 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of NASA,
really bring up the question

00:28:38.322 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Nazi role within
the deep state itself--

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.155 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:41.155 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --because aren't
they a major player in that--

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: The US swallowed that
poison pill after World War II.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We all now know about
Project Paperclip.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And this was the importation
of hardcore unrepentant Nazis

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:90%
after the war.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But they were coveted because
of two reasons, really.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.870 align:middle line:84%
One was the whole
intelligence community.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
They were experts in
spying on the Soviet Union.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But the other were
the scientists.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
greatest prize.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were brought
in almost entirely

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
into the US deep state.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You're exactly right.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
impossible to swallow

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that much poison without taking
that poison into your system.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.784 align:middle line:84%
So what is, say,
the post Nazi role?

00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who these
people are today.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Are they still old
fashioned Nazis?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:90%
But what is their role?

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And is NASA part of it?

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
NASA is part of this.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.465 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that there are
probably clandestine agencies

00:29:43.465 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:90%
that exist right now.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
After all, the NSA and
the NRO both existed

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
for years in complete secrecy
before they were revealed.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The United States has a long
history, in other words,

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:84%
of having substantial
intelligence agencies

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of power
existing in total secrecy.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And my suspicion is that
this is the case today.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But even for the United States
to have swallowed the Nazis,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and actually have, as we know
historically, from the Wall

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Street financial perspective,
have been involved

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in the rise of the Nazis--

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> DOLAN: Yes.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --what can we make
about the fascist nature

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:84%
of the global elite or perhaps
the ultimate group that runs

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:90%
the world?

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Isn't there a bit of a
fascist component to it?

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: We're in a neo
fascist world right now.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is that no
one recognizes it openly.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.720 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
fascism, some people

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:84%
like to think of the 1930s
and Hitler and Mussolini.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that form of
fascism was in your face.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:90%
They let you know.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a fascist society.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:90%
There was no question about it.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Today, fascism is
much more clever.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And today fascism will
include Monday Night Football

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%
and dancing with the whatever.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's entertainment
and it's distraction.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's still fascism.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a global fascism
in which your rights

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and my rights as citizens
are being abrogated.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:84%
That is-- if it's not
Nazism, it is fascism.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we are
dealing with on a global basis

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.130 align:middle line:90%
right before our very eyes.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
engaged citizens

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:90%
have to deal with and fight.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: There is almost a
religious nature to fascism,

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:84%
which I think is the basis
of what is everything that

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
we're describing here, is that
it A has to do with media being

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:84%
a form of religion and how it
controls our worldview, right,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:84%
government being a form
of religion which we obey.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.396 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what, we
go to the polls and we

00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
elect, whether it's a
Democrat or Republican.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:84%
It's always the same basically
two party, one party state,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're ultimately
being controlled by.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So how would you say this
false flag is ultimately

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:84%
playing into the ultimate
paradigm of duality that

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
really never shifts us out
of a fascist structure?

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Are there alternative
ways of being in our--

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
because we are so enclosed now,
our mind view, our world scape,

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.920 align:middle line:84%
our worldview is so enclosed,
how do we get out of this?

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DOLAN: I feel that
this is a great question.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I analyze, in my forthcoming
book on false flags,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.754 align:middle line:84%
I see false flags as
a form of propaganda.

00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not the only
form of propaganda.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:84%
They're just the nastiest, most
violent form of propaganda.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.772 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of the
spectrum that I identify

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:84%
from things as simple as
cultural conditioning,

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, hand over the
heart, pledging allegiance,

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.610 align:middle line:84%
to the cultural distractions
like the Kardashians,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:90%
everything else that are there.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
They're telling
us, look over here.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at the
theft of your planet

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.936 align:middle line:84%
and the abrogation
of your rights.

00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Look at this little trinket.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
To news media, corporate
control, and news

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
spin and lies in the
mainstream news media,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
to covert ops and false flags.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
All of it are part
of a spectrum.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what people
need to understand

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is that this is not about fear.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:84%
This is not about having
people be afraid of the world

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.860 align:middle line:90%
we're in.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:90%
It's about not despairing.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It's about waking up.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:90%
It's about facing truth.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's about empowering ourselves
through understanding truth.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
The United States
and the Western bloc

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that is under its
control is in many ways,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the control over
media, right where the Soviet

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Union was in the 1970s.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Where Pravda and
Izvestia were complete

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:90%
mouthpieces for the Kremlin.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:90%
We have that now in the West.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's not simply one network.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's many Western major media
networks, major newspapers

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and major television outlets.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
They serve in the
exact same way.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So if someone wants to have the
chance of getting at some truth

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and waking up and actually--
because it's only with truth

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are set
free-- then they have

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to begin by really clearing
the deck of the mainstream news

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:84%
narrative, the Western
dominated news narrative,

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and going outside of that
into alternative news media.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And beginning that process.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is not to say that
all alternative news is

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:90%
perfect and correct.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Truth is not the
easiest thing to get at.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:90%
We have to work at it.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But you're never going to get
it if you turn on and watch CNN.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
You'll become
hopelessly confused

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of all time.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.159 align:middle line:84%
When those organizations are
working for State Department,

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.909 align:middle line:84%
CIA, National Security
establishment,

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:90%
they have to lie.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:84%
They can't tell
you that there is

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.139 align:middle line:84%
this small elite that's stealing
the world underneath our feet.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So they have to deceive.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And therefore they
have to confuse.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.929 align:middle line:84%
They can't give you
the straight truth.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why people
are turned off politics,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because they
don't understand it.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:84%
All they see is one
thing after another,

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:90%
one explosion after another.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, why
do they hate us?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Do they hate our freedoms?

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And all of this.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting the big
picture, which is what we need.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is only through
alternative non-establishment

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.894 align:middle line:84%
