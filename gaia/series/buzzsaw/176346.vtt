00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE:
Welcome to "Buzzsaw,"

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.724 align:middle line:84%
where we cut through
the mainstream narrative

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to explore the twilight
zones of reality,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
With me today is Lee Harris--

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.054 align:middle line:10%
channel, intuitive healer,
and author of "Energy Speaks."

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
His service-to-others
approach has

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:10%
helped him build his
company, Lee Harris Energy,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:10%
into a multimedia worldwide
event company and production

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:10%
house.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:10%
His acclaimed Soul Magic
and Energy Mastery retreats

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:10%
are adventures as the deepest
aspects of living, loving,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and awakening.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Lee, you channel a group
that calls themselves the Zs,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
if I'm correct.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Who are they, for our audience?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE HARRIS: So when I
first heard the voice,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:10%
which was how I'd
experienced it--

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:10%
I asked them at some point,
I think a few days in,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
do you have a name?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we don't have names.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
humans need names,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:90%
so you can call me Zachary.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the spokesperson
for the group.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And then as the years
went on, a few others

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
identified themselves
and they gave the names

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Zapharia and Zaiadurah.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So now I just call them
the Zs, because they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
speak from a centralized voice
but they're a collective.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And do they
have any reference

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the history of
channeling or alien contact,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:90%
civilizations?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no, they don't.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:90%
I was a naive channeler.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know about
the channeling world.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I was very into self-growth
and personal development,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:90%
and definitely mysticism.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I have had a few different
people email me over the years

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I've
heard your channeling.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.156 align:middle line:84%
And my guide is called Z
something, or Zachariah also.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
No, but I've never heard
anything in history,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
or never seen anything
out there that makes

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
me think that's
where they're from.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So they've never
identified location or?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.436 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, but they have
said they're travelers--

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:90%
because I asked that.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, are you
from a certain planet?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Are you angelic?

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, think of us
as a consciousness library

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:90%
and a voice of galactic source.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
They say that some of the group
have had incarnations on Earth.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Some have had
incarnations off Earth.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:90%
And now they're a central force.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting,
because I definitely

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
feel a whole mixture of
energies in the group

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and what comes through.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you've described
your channeling as a surprise,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:90%
But what was that like?

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did
that actually-- what

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
were you doing, for example,
that might have triggered it,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:90%
or how did it come about?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
so I think for me,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
the short version
is, as a kid I was

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
very sensitive, very intuitive,
but I didn't know I was.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So I, like many sensitive
intuitive young people

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
who haven't yet been
shown how to manage that,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
turned it on myself.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I was taken to Weight
Watchers age 10,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
because I'd developed
addictive eating quite early

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
as one of my compensations
or ways of coping.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to unpack
myself in my late teens,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I got really into
personal growth.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would go for tarot
readings and something

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
would crackle in my
body at a tarot reading.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Something would feel true to me.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.791 align:middle line:84%
And I started playing
with cards with my friends

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and they would say,
how did you know that?

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.331 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
anything about the cards.

00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I just would put them down.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to learn that
I had an intuitive ability,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that if I used cards it would
be like the permission for me

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:84%
to read or send
something about somebody.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take someone's
hand, hold their hand,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:90%
and get information.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't looking
for disease to happen.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I was on the London
Underground, going

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to my job in
corporate fundraising,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
going through all
of the thoughts

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
in my own head
that were negative,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
self-doubting, all about,
really, my low self-worth

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:90%
and how could I get through it.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was just going
through all of those thoughts.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And very clearly,
still to this day

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
if I speak to them I hear
them kind of in this location

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
position-wise to my
head, it was an answer

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
that answered the
negative thought

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that I was debating in my head
with such clarity and strength

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom that I was like, oh?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So then this back and
forth conversation

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
was going between what I
knew as my own mind, which

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.869 align:middle line:84%
is kind of here,
and this other voice

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that was coming in from
up here and saying things

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know, but when I
heard them something in my body

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
would relax.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.264 align:middle line:84%
So I would go home
and write questions.

00:04:43.264 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course you
think, am I going mad?

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this schizophrenia?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But gradually, the more I grew
to see how useful the voice was

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to me, and then to friends, I
started to relax a little bit,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
got asked to do it

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as a job by a shamanic healer
and yoga teacher that I had.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you should
do readings for people.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind
of how it started.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But never in a million years
did I think it would happen.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I also had a lot of
skepticism, because I thought,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.636 align:middle line:90%
this should be harder.

00:05:12.636 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be on an
underground train.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:90%
I should be, like, meditating.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I should have got to some
state of enlightenment.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.565 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things that I really teach.

00:05:20.565 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be a channel,
whether that's connecting

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to another energy or entity
or just your higher self,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:90%
you can do it.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I run
workshops, I always

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.485 align:middle line:84%
make sure everyone is
given pen and paper,

00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and I always stop the
workshop at some point

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and go, sit there
and write a message

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
from your higher self
for five minutes,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
because we can all do that.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.627 align:middle line:90%
We just don't.

00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What has
been the main message

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:90%
that the Zs have given you?

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The main message.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: I mean, the purpose.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I would
say the main effect--

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and this is the effect
that I bring to my work

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:90%
as an energy teacher--

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is that really, when we
open to our purpose and why

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:90%
we're here--

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and that can be
momentary or grand--

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
then we start to become
part of the jigsaw piece

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that we are for the
rest of the world.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we all have a part to
play in this specific time

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot going on,
and we couldn't possibly

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:90%
take care of all of it.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you take care of
your personal calling

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
in your personal relationships
and in the work that you're

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
doing, you will play your
part at this time in history.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what they
do and what I work to do

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.697 align:middle line:84%
is to help people unpack the
stuff that's in their way,

00:06:32.697 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
just as I'm doing that
every day as a human being,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
trying to kind of
bridge that gap

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
between human density
and higher energies

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and higher frequencies,
which I believe

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:90%
is the challenge we all have.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.386 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's the
challenge of connecting

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to our heart and our soul, and
basically recognizing the heart

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and soul purpose beyond the
physical necessity desires,

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:90%
the ego of everyday living.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
that everyone has

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
their own individual
guides, or are these guides

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
basically working with
others within the 3D realm?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.947 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I do.

00:07:03.947 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel we all
have a connection.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So my perspective on it is there
are many, many, many layers.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So there are all
of these layers,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
there are all of these
dimensions, and some of us

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
will align with a certain
group or a certain guide.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe we all
have our own guides.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But I've met some
channelers who--

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.535 align:middle line:90%
and not just channelers.

00:07:23.535 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:84%
In the public realm,
I've met some people who

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
are channeling off world
and that's their contact,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and I've met others who
don't see it that way

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
but they just have a wisdom
voice or a higher self.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So for me, everything up here
is accessible to all of us

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
if we either have an opening
or we cultivate a desire.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So one thing I kind
of recognize is

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I bought this book called "How
to Connect with your Spiritual

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Guide" not long before
I started channeling.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I never read it, but I
had it in my presence.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big believer in that,
have the title or the word

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
or the affirmation
in your presence.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.275 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of helps send
a sign to the universe

00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%
that you're open and ready.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe everyone
has contact of some kind.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You know,
a lot of people

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
have had contact because
of traumas in their life.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes we've heard about
psychics and others who

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
were traumatized as children,
and as a result basically

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:90%
opening to other realms.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
What do you teach in terms
of your energy mastery

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that gets people, like what
are some basic practices

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
or understanding that people
can use without having to wait

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
for trauma to occur,
to actually start

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.985 align:middle line:84%
to open to that
spiritual understanding?

00:08:29.985 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's funny
you bring that up,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.984 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things that
took me years to recognize

00:08:33.984 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
was how many traumatized people
had had spiritual openings

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
or gone to spirituality
to feel safe.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.604 align:middle line:90%
So we leave the body.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we leave the body,
we can access everything else.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is then, how
do you start to come back?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So my own personal path and
what I've seen with others

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.437 align:middle line:84%
is you have these
openings and epiphanies,

00:08:52.437 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
but there's always going
to be a point that you're

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
going to be asked to come
back, both to the body

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and to the horizontal world,
and be useful, basically.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to stay out there,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise
we could just die.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.015 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of the things that--

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I think really,
one of the things

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that I've stood for
over the years--

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't understand
this at the time,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
but I see it now-- is helping
sensitives or people who've

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
gone through the trauma of being
sensitive on this planet come

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
back to their body,
come back to their life.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And we do so many
different things.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a big advocate
of we need creativity

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%
to balance our life.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Creative energy is so important.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's channeling.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And for many people,
it's the only way

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
they'll see the light reflected.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you are very
isolated at home

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can't deal
with people right now,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.092 align:middle line:84%
one of the things the
Zs said is create,

00:09:41.092 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
because they said then you
bring your angelic energy,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
your angelic presence
onto the earth.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even about
sharing it with others.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.389 align:middle line:84%
It's just about you
seeing something reflected

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that you have managed
to bring through you,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
because all sensitives need
to see light on the planet.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So the trauma comes from the
darkness and the density.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So the successful
sensitives find

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
a way to bring light and
creative action to the planet.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:84%
For the last few years,
I've worked a lot

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
with people who
want to be a force

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
for change and for positive
creativity on the planet.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
something that usually,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
once you unlock your
self-esteem, self-worth, fear

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
issues, you start
to perform and you

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
start to become what I call
part of the wheel in the world.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.864 align:middle line:84%
You're contributing,
and that contribution

00:10:28.864 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
is its own personal
growth journey

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
because then you have
all these experiences of,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm offering this
work to the world,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and I meet this person
and I get taken here.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a hidden--

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It opens new
doors, new dimensions.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
But how do you experience
psychic attacks

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.366 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the work when
you obviously are channeling

00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're opening into the
light and doing creative work

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.906 align:middle line:84%
and really bringing light
to the darkness, what type

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:84%
of psychic attacks
do you encounter?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, there
are YouTube comments.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And they're like a tiny version.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know, I
haven't personally

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
experienced strong psychic
attack because of channeling.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But you feel it, for example,
when you're in a workshop room.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I always break
this down to people

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:84%
who are teaching or
leading workshops as well,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
or beginning to.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be a
periphery energy in that room,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
because that's life.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Even if you manage to create
the most heartfelt, strong

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
foundation of love and
opening for that room,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
if you've got 100
people in the room

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be 10
around the edges that

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
are anything from resistant,
which is its own form of attack

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
on what's going on, through
to aggressively pushing

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
against what you're doing.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, when I go
out and do live events,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I always notice the
disruptive forces.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.896 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to
notice them and you

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
know how to boundary
against them

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and not give them
what they want,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.446 align:middle line:84%
because they will try
and hook your attention,

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
they will try and get you
to take their suffering,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
then you can stay working
with the center of the room.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that's
always been my, I guess,

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
most up close and personal
experience of psychic attack--

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
or somebody attacking me for
what I won't do for them,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
an expectation that
I should give them--

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes of channeling
outside the room.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I'm
running an event.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I see the subtlety
in those attacks

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
rather than ever having a
strong awareness of somebody

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:90%
psychically attacking me.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But I have some good
support, and people who

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:90%
look out for me in that way.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So people have a hard time
with opening the third eye.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Is this, do you
think, largely because

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of our social conditioning
or are there physical factors

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and toxins environmentally that
are also blocking our third eye

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.102 align:middle line:90%
opening?

00:12:44.102 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
interesting, because we're

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
living in such a toxic time,
and yet at the same time

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I see the rise of
consciousness happening.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think the internet
has helped people

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
to see themselves.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I always think of the
hundredth monkey syndrome.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you see enough
channeling, if you

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.667 align:middle line:84%
are in a room with
a channeler, if you

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are around somebody
who's good at something,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to lean
into that, if it's for you,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:90%
and just become that.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:90%
So you know, it's a weird one.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a catch-22.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:90%
For me personally, no.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably less
toxic in my body

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:84%
now than I was when I was
22 when it happened to me.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I have a cleaner lifestyle.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.667 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know about that.

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
That's not something
I've experienced.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.333 align:middle line:84%
But it's something I hear
other people talk about.

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think the fear of
the third eye opening

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.073 align:middle line:84%
is what it's going to
do to the rest of you,

00:13:35.073 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:90%
because it takes no prisoners.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, once I
started channeling,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.756 align:middle line:84%
man, it was like
self-growth was on steroids.

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
always comfortable.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't always easy.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:90%
You have to manage imbalance.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So when your third
eye opens, because you

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
get this very visionary
experience of the world, all

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden if you
haven't had that before,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
it can destabilize
parts of your life.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It can destabilize-- it
can have a big effect

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
on your sexual energy, your
heart energy, the whole thing.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So for a lot of
people, the third eye

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful place
to kill your identity.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But we're all trained
to protect our identity

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and to be safe
around our identity.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So the third eye is definitely
a catalyst for everything else.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But as you kind of
alluded to earlier,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
unless it's working in resonance
with all the other chakras,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
we're imbalanced.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's that crazy
psychic that you meet

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that wants to assault you
with their third eye seeing,

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
but they're imbalanced
everywhere else.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of comes with a
punch rather than with support,

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.796 align:middle line:90%
love, and help.

00:14:35.796 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So how
would someone know

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:90%
if their third eye was open?

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, usually
people are experiencing

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
visions and intuitions.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And usually that's different
to how it was before.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So you may be
sitting-- for example,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
if my third eye just opened
and you and I were friends,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd suddenly be sitting with
you and I'd be like, wow,

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.357 align:middle line:84%
I can tell that Sean's
about to go off and do

00:14:57.357 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:90%
this really amazing thing.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't tell
me anything about it,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
but I've got this feeling I'm
not going to see him again.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So you start to get little
senses or information

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.412 align:middle line:84%
about other people that
may or may not be true.

00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's always
worth investigating.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But you start to go beyond
the linear what people are

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:90%
telling you, how people appear.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
You start to sense things
in a different way.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
you have to learn

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
how to turn that on
and off and when it's

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:90%
appropriate to see in that way.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So usually people
are very clear when

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:84%
they've had a third eye opening,
because the world changes.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.841 align:middle line:84%
It's like things get 3D
in ways that can sometimes

00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
be very uncomfortable as
well, if you don't know

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.465 align:middle line:90%
how to manage it or handle it.

00:15:35.465 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You
mentioned, obviously,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that the world is more
toxic than ever-- well, I

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
don't know if than ever.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about
ancient history.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that
there's obviously

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pollution,
environmental toxins,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
chemtrails, 5G Wi-Fi,
things like this.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
How is that making it harder
to tune in and channel?

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's interesting.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I haven't personally noticed
a difference, certainly

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:90%
in it making it harder.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's a funny one.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a catch-22, because I look
at the 5G Wi-Fi reports that

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
are out there, and
yet at the same time,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
in a strange way I
think that people

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
opening their consciousness has
been advanced by the internet.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's this catch-22
of our current world.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But for me personally, I
don't notice any difficulty

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:90%
with channeling.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I do wonder-- because all
of us now are overstimulated

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and using our devices and
with the computer a lot more--

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
do we practice presence
enough to come back

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to want to channel, or are
we into the next stimulation?

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:43.186 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly this
very telepathic experience

00:16:43.186 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:90%
has happened to the world--

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.851 align:middle line:84%
that's how I experience
the internet.

00:16:45.851 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the internet has
raised telepathic understanding

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and experience for people.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, you've
got everybody

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
can see everything
and communicate

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
with everybody in a way
that's quite hive mind.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's
the first big example

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
of that happening
on a mass level.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective,
like anything,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:90%
there's a good side to it.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
And with the 5G and the Wi-Fi
stuff, like most people,

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm still monitoring
the information

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out
and wondering what's

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
going to happen for
all of us around that.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.174 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But don't you think that
diet and food and other things

00:17:18.174 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
play a role in terms
of where the body goes,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:90%
the mind and soul go?

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if your body is toxic
and polluted and stimulated

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
the wrong ways,
that even if you are

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
channeling or
having an awakening,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:90%
it's ultimately not going to--

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
your body's ill
health will not be

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
conducive to it furthering
empowering yourself.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Definitely.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.086 align:middle line:84%
I also notice--
it's interesting.

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed a lot of
channelers, intuitives,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and psychics can sometimes
be on the heavier side.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly have
had that with myself.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.892 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
asked the Zs about that,

00:17:52.892 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and they said because you're
trying to ground and stabilize

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
high frequency on a planet
that isn't necessarily.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think sometimes
you pay the price,

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
or you haven't yet
reached a place--

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and you don't need to
maybe for your soul path--

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
to get that aligned.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I meet others
who are very aligned

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and they really practice--

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess my
point, Sean, is I've

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
met some blindingly brilliant
channellers and intuitives who

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
aren't necessarily as healthy
as the next person who

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe doesn't have
quite the talent

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
or the ability they have.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So I always put that
down to personal path.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We all come here with a
destiny, and we come here

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:90%
to experience certain things.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
how we all take

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
on different wounds
or physical ailments

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:90%
that others don't necessarily.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And are these wounds
and ailments and mostly

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
our self-induced blocks
what essentially keep us

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
from manifesting?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I am a
believer in both.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think yes,
the self-induced.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But I also look at the
control on this planet,

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff that is
holding us in place

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and the limited options
that are given to us.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interesting one.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
When you look at what's going
on in the world that is toxic

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and damning to
human progression--

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and not just human progression,
all life on the planet--

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:90%
it's tricky.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.575 align:middle line:84%
But the Zs are always
saying, create the new.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
They say, unless you're
one of the people who

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be right
up against the fight

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and be an activist
against those forces,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:90%
you have to create the new.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a tricky and
interesting time to be alive.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.399 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I look
at it as, we're creating.

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
We're here to create
the new and we're here

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:90%
to create the solution.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So people tend to fall into
a couple of different camps

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But just to kind of go back
to your question, for me,

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I do think there is a level of--

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
there is a gravity here
that we can't avoid.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And as a visionary, as
an intuitive, as someone

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.354 align:middle line:84%
who can feel and
sense, we can all

00:19:53.354 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:84%
have those experiences
where we go, wow,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
more beyond this.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But we come back
to the human suit

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and we come back to
the gravity boots.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.363 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What do you
think about this phrase,

00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:90%
all the universe is within you?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would also say we're
within all of the universe,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
meaning if you look out
it just keeps going.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe that.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I do believe--

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.899 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, and I
experience that a lot.

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And then other times
I don't experience it,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
because I've come up
through human separation,

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.260 align:middle line:90%
human conditioning.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Executive
mentality separation,

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
when if fact we could say
that everything that's

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.176 align:middle line:84%
happening to us, everything
that's happening on the planet

00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately a reflection
of that which is within us

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and needs to be
manifest, perhaps,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
needs to be expressed
and worked out.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Definitely.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.995 align:middle line:84%
We came here to roll up our
sleeves is kind of the message

00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:90%
that they often give.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But they also say a lot of
people here have given up.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that has
been one of my messages

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.696 align:middle line:84%
is if you're still on the
planet, there's a reason.

00:20:52.696 --> 00:20:54.195 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a lot of
people go, ugh, I'm

00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:55.694 align:middle line:90%
on the wrong planet, wrong time.

00:20:55.694 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I was dropped off in
the wrong universe.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They say, no, it's
really easy to die.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:90%
You can die like that.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you're here, get curious
about what you're here to do

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and what you hear
to find for yourself

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:90%
and alleviate for yourself.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, as
you said, it's very

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
easy to give up in
a place like this

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and very hard to
spread love and light.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So is it enough to just
say, look, positive

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:90%
thinking, love and light.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
We can do this.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is there more that needs to
be done to really get there?

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, not
for me it's not enough.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not been my path.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
My path has been
all of it, you know?

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The whole human journey with
all of its difficulties.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the people that
I see on the planet who I feel

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
are the biggest
changemakers, certainly

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
where the mass
consciousness is concerned,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.307 align:middle line:90%
they're in the trenches.

00:21:46.307 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:90%
They're not just love and light.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They know the pain or the
suffering of what we go through

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:84%
as humanity, and
they are bringing

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
their best tools and ideas and
energy towards shifting that.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.366 align:middle line:84%
I don't diss the love and
light brigade, though,

00:22:01.366 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
because there are certain people
who really want to be the love

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and light brigade,
and they just want

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:90%
to sit there and hold space.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing their job.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But for me, do I
resonate with that?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm too human.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:90%
At this point, right?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: All too human.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.645 align:middle line:84%
What are the lightspeed
density detoxes?

00:22:18.645 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Ah, lightspeed
density detoxes.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.637 align:middle line:84%
I think you're referring to
something that I probably spoke

00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:90%
about in an energy update.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I do these monthly
energy updates

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:90%
where I just take the pulse.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're free
videos each month.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And I once talked about
lightspeed density detoxes.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's that part
of us that as we ascend,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
we let go of all the stuff
that we no longer need.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.414 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you
have a great epiphany

00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:84%
about what you're going
to do and you're like,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.134 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I'm going to
start this healing center,

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be in this place

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
in the world which
really needs it

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.666 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to put all
my energy towards it.

00:22:53.666 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Feels amazing.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Then what's going to happen
is all the parts of you that

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%
weren't ready for that--

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
the part of you that
thinks, I can't do this,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
they don't want this, who
am I to think of this--

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that will go through
a density detox.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: All the fear.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --the
path of creation.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We set out on the
creational journey,

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and we will shed and
transmute whatever

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
we need to transmute as the
creator as we go through it.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So the lightspeed
density detoxes are--

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
what I've noticed is happening
for people now versus, say,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago when I was
first doing energy updates,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:90%
it's rapid.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So whereas before you
could have taken a week

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
self-worth issue, now

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:84%
you're just going through it for
two or three very funky hours

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:90%
that don't make any sense.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%
You thought you were fine.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Everything was going well.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And this lightspeed density
detox is going through you.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's best, in my experience,
to just love the process

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.714 align:middle line:84%
rather than think that
something's wrong.

00:23:46.714 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You can try and make
yourself more comfortable

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
as you go through it, but it's
just happening for everybody

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.551 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Are these
ascension symptoms?

00:23:53.551 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I would say
they are accelerated ascension

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.651 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: That's good then.

00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.676 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Was there one
teaching in particular that

00:24:02.676 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
started you on your path
of harnessing your healing

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:90%
abilities?

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Hm.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a teaching.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
There were lots of different
teachers, workshops, books.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny, when
you ask me that question

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
the book that comes to my mind
is "The Four Agreements" by Don

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Miguel Ruiz.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:10%
I got that the year
it came out, I think,

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:10%
and nobody knew about it.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately bought
seven copies for friends

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.644 align:middle line:90%
and handed them out.

00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was just such a
lightbulb moment to me.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I read it and I
knew it was true.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.199 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew I
couldn't reach it.

00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at it
going, oh my god.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It was the same as channeling.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, I see where
I'm not these things yet,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:84%
but I see that this is
the direction to go in.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So that was a real
lightbulb book for me.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then lots of other
books and workshops.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But no, I've never
followed one way.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
a bit of a multi--

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.939 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of this, a
little bit of that, try this.

00:24:49.939 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But what
excites you the most

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:90%
about the work you're doing?

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I would say--

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
what excites me the most?

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm a creator.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Since I was a kid, I
just create things.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I
would do this work,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.364 align:middle line:84%
but it makes so much
sense to me now.

00:25:02.364 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
When I look back I'm like,
oh, I see that everything

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:90%
was lining up for this.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
What excites me the most is
when I hear from somebody

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
who says, the way you
said that, or that course

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that I just took of
yours has changed my life

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in tears--

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
so what excites me is
being able to contribute.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:10%
I think of Don
Miguel Ruiz or Tori

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:10%
Amos or any of the books
or artists or films

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:10%
that have affected me
and lit me back up.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:10%
So I like to be able to
throw it back into the wheel.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to be one of
the people now who--

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't be a heart surgeon.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
That's not my training
or my alliance.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I can do for people
is in the work I create.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:90%
That's my contribution.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully for
the people it's

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
resonant for, it will be the
next step for them that day.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So that lights me up, the
service and the purpose of it.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken me
years to get to that.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me years to feel
that as the biggest truth,

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
but that really is
what works for me now.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.636 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So it strikes
me that you're basically

00:26:00.636 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
here to inspire and to
catalyze shifts and energy

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:90%
change in people.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
How do people arrive
as energy masters?

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
How do we as individuals get
to that level of responsibility

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and self-actualization
and control

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to become masters
of our own energy?

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, for
me personally I expect

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:90%
it to be a lifelong thing.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And I also see how, with
the world changing so much,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly
having to rebalance.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like paddleboarding
through life.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
really strong core,

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and you need to know
when the wave is

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:90%
coming and all that stuff.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.664 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's really
about understanding yourself

00:26:36.664 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and your connection
to everything.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
And presence is what brings it.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of my work is, how
do we get back to presence

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:90%
without fear?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And for me too, how do
I get back to presence

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
when I notice I've moved
off, I've gone into the mind?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that's what the
path of energy mastery is.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't
think it's individual.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I think even if you're focused
on yourself as an individual,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing is way
bigger than each of us

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:90%
individuals right now.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're
focused on your bit,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
you're contributing
to the energy change

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.881 align:middle line:90%
that's happening on the planet.

00:27:06.881 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's kind
of an endless journey.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do the Zs
ever talk about where

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.334 align:middle line:90%
we're going as a species?

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They've said
a few different things.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
They've said that there are
many timeline possibilities.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that they have
held-- it's interesting.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 10
years, I remember

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
being a little activated by
some stuff that I was reading

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and learning about in the late
2000s, so about 2009, 2010.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember talking
to them about that stuff.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.911 align:middle line:84%
And at the time there were
all these predictions.

00:27:39.911 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, this is going
to happen, and in 2012.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.386 align:middle line:84%
And I got fear activated
like a lot of people did.

00:27:46.386 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were always
like, uh-uh, nope,

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:90%
not going to happen that way.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:84%
None of this is going to
come to pass in this way.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a very slow
change, and everything

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to take a very
long time to change.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The things that you
fear might happen

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to be imploding
from the inside.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But they have said
it will get messy.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.587 align:middle line:84%
And they've said, you will see
as you go from 2014 to 2025,

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:90%
it will get messier.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.206 align:middle line:84%
And here we are recording
this show in 2018

00:28:13.206 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, oh
yeah, now I understand

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.955 align:middle line:90%
what they're talking about.

00:28:15.955 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
They always said
that people would

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.235 align:middle line:84%
have to get in touch
with their emotions

00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:84%
before they got in touch with
their higher consciousness.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So I have watched over
the last few years,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:84%
because of all these
outer catalysts, people

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
getting very emotional and
very intense about stuff.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But now there is
this plethora of information,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, conversation,
and tools for us

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
where we can go, oh, this
is an angry reaction.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean everybody
is going to go that way.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But more and more
people are beginning

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to understand themselves
in a deeper way.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And then that ripples out
to the whole of society.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.539 align:middle line:84%
It strikes me that when you're
talking about energy mastery,

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:90%
you have to work with emotions.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the most important
aspect or catalyzing energy

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:90%
force within us.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.587 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the emotions,
once we work them out,

00:28:58.587 --> 00:29:00.419 align:middle line:84%
are they meant to lead
us back to the heart?

00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that the intention?

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so bringing
us to a place where we can not

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
only be in our own heart
and present space more,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:90%
but also for others.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
about you, but I know

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm much better at conflict
now than I was 10 years ago.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm in the
energy of conflict,

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I know how to be
to help diffuse it

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and I also know when to
leave, when it's escalating

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's not for me to defuse.

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, this
is supposed to go off.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm now supposed to leave.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we talk about a lot in
the energy mastery workshops--

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.895 align:middle line:84%
and what the Zs
will talk about--

00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
is really trust
yourself and your focus.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not, completely
ignore the stuff

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in the
world that's challenging.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's recognize
that by following

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:84%
your purpose and your path
and going where you feel led,

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to get to a place

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
where you will start to emanate
more and more for other people.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I see that with the people
that I'm really touched by,

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the people who walk
into a room and you can

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:90%
see they've got a connection.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They've got something
they practice every day,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.711 align:middle line:84%
and they're bringing
something to the room.

00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:84%
They're vibrationally
upleveling the room

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:84%
or giving the room a chance to
balance or a person to go, wow,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm always calm
when I'm around you.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that means I'm chaotic.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's not to do it for others
without thinking of yourself.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus
on what you're here

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to do in your own
personal development,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
you start to naturally
become more benevolent.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And this
is something that's

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.478 align:middle line:84%
so important, because you're
saying your service to others.

00:30:27.478 --> 00:30:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, I always say to
people, focus on your path

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.325 align:middle line:84%
and then you will be
service to others.

00:30:32.325 --> 00:30:34.324 align:middle line:84%
Whereas some people want
to go out there and get

00:30:34.324 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
so involved in other things,
and doing this and charity

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.116 align:middle line:84%
and focused on
the outside world,

00:30:40.116 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that they actually lose touch
with their own power, which

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.657 align:middle line:90%
is within themselves, right?

00:30:43.657 --> 00:30:45.198 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
saying essentially

00:30:45.198 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
is going within yourself is
the most important thing you

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
can do to become a
role model, to become

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:90%
a light for the world.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think for a lot of healers
and a lot of purpose-driven

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.391 align:middle line:84%
and a healer to me also
can be an activist.

00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be someone
who's working one-on-one with.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's
trying to help bring

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
more light to the
world in whatever way.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.570 align:middle line:84%
There's been a real sea
change in the last kind

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.570 align:middle line:90%
of six, seven years.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot of people
go through burnout,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:90%
want to give up their job.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they
were pushing out first.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, I'm here
to heal the suffering.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, the suffering exists.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have our own
personal suffering

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that we have to come
to reckoning with.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So the more you focus on
where you want to go next--

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's challenging for
healers, because that seems

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.888 align:middle line:90%
selfish or counter-intuitive.

00:31:28.888 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They're like, but I'm
here to have a purpose.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, try not having
a purpose for year

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and see where you go next.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know for myself,
I had a few periods

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
where I thought I was
going to stop this job.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And I really gave
myself permission

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:84%
to stop it for like
six, nine months.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually what happened was
I kind of rebirthed and found

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
new ways--

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because you
attract basically what

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:90%
you're meant to do.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of pushing,
everything comes to you.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, a lot of
rebirthing for healers back

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.322 align:middle line:10%
into trusting what they feel
and hear rather than going,

00:31:59.322 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:10%
oh my god, there's a problem.
