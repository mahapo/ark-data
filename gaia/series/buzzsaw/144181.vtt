>> It's time for magic and
mystery at the Fourth Turning.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.553 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:18.219 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean Stone,
and joining me today

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:10%
is Jay Weidner, who was
called by "Wired" magazine

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
an authority on the hermetic
and alchemical traditions.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Jay Weidner is a renowned
filmmaker, author, and scholar.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.601 align:middle line:84%
His body of works
offers great insight

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
into the circumstances
that have led

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
to the current global crisis.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:10%
He's writer/director of the new
feature film "The Last Avatar,"

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
director of the critically
acclaimed documentary

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:10%
"Infinity: The Ultimate
Trip, Journey Beyond Death"

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
and writer/director of the
documentary series on the work

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:10%
of Stanley Kubrick, including
"Kubrick's Odyssey" and "Beyond

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:10%
the Infinite."

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Today he takes us on a
journey into his research.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start
by asking you,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you've said that the only people
who call conspiracies theories

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.465 align:middle line:90%
are the conspirators.

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:05.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And that begs the
question, you know,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
why do you believe in
conspiracy so adamantly?

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:90%
What was your wakening moment?

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I had the good fortune
most of my life of, for some

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:10%
reason, being invited into
high-ranking Freemasonic

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:10%
libraries, and by
33rd-degree Freemasons,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.504 align:middle line:10%
who took a liking to
me for some reason.

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I could never take
the books home,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
but I could read them
in their libraries.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was maybe in my
early 20s at this point.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading a lot
of very interesting books.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I began realizing
that, in fact, conspiracy

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is the way of life and
political landscape.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
you to know that,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
so they make sure that anybody
who talks about conspiracies

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.447 align:middle line:84%
are labeled a theorist or
a whack job or something.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would be some of the
most mind-blowing conspiracies

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.238 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever encountered?

00:01:57.238 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Things that maybe
even make you say,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can believe
that, but it's quite possible.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the culminating
moment for me was when I read

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
a book, a very obscure book,
called "Was Jonestown a CIA

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Medical Experiment?"

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
by an Oxford
professor of religion.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very intense
read, about 300 pages.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.804 align:middle line:84%
And I got so terrified
at the end of the book

00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that I wrapped
myself in a blanket

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
and crawled under my bed.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe that it was
a CIA medical experiment now.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I firmly believe it.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
the most terrifying book

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I have probably ever read.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> But obviously given that
was in the '70s and here we are

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
today with almost
on a daily basis,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
just do you think that what
we're seeing when it comes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to all these mass shootings
and a lot of the media storms

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.707 align:middle line:84%
around events, do they indicate
sort of mass psychological

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
operations being done
against the American people?

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I would say definitely.

00:02:57.123 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I would say that I would find
almost every mass shooting

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
event of the last five
years to be very suspect--

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:90%
very suspect.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
look into these things

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and the more you try to
get details, the less

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:90%
you get details.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you get details that
contradict the story line.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very suspicious
of almost every event

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:90%
that I'm hearing about.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that,
in fact, it is CNN

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and MSNBC and Fox that
are the fake news,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:90%
and we're the real news.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with you on that.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So you've written about this
concept of the Fourth Turning

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.766 align:middle line:84%
in American history, that
basically every 70 to 80 years

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:84%
there is this sort of
massive transformative event,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
American Revolution, then

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
the Civil War, World War II.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that each
time, each of these events

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is essentially reflecting on the
sins and the crimes that were

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
left incomplete of the past--

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.671 align:middle line:84%
>> --the things that were
attempted but never resolved.

00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:52.449 align:middle line:84%
So what would that
leave us if we were now

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:90%
approaching the Fourth Turning?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are approaching
the Fourth Turning.

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would point out that Steve
Bannon, Trump's top adviser,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:84%
has written extensively
about the Fourth Turning.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:90%
So he's very aware of this.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:10%
"The Fourth Turning," of course,
is a book by Howe and Strauss

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:10%
about American history.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend
that everyone read it.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:10%
And, yeah, from 1776
was the First Turning.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
1860 was the Second Turning.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.796 align:middle line:84%
1940 to '45 was
the Third Turning,

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and now we're approaching
the Fourth Turning, which

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:90%
would be done by 2025 or so.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And basically, yeah, so
in the first turning,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to keep
the Union together,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the Southern states were going
to bolt if we outlawed slavery.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And Jefferson and Washington,
believe it or not,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
actually tried to do
it, but they couldn't.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:84%
They realized that they had
to hold the Union together

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
because the British were
so adamant about getting

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:90%
their country back.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that sin of
slavery was left

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to fester until Lincoln
decided to solve

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
the problem in the 1860s,
which is the Second Turning.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting is on the
Third Turning, which was 1940

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:10%
to '45 or so, the most popular
movie of the Third Turning

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:10%
until "Jaws,"
actually, was "Gone

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:10%
with the Wind," which
is a reflection of how

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:10%
great the antebellum South was.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, when you
watch "Gone with the Wind"

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:10%
today with our eyes, it's almost
like a freakish experience.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It isn't even a good movie.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like, who are
these people, right?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we're so alienated
from even the people that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
were in the Third
Turning now that we're

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%
approaching the Fourth Turning.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And this country will
be completely different,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.477 align:middle line:84%
just like at the
end of World War II.

00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
We were a completely
different country

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
than when we started
World War II.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We will be a completely
different country

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.592 align:middle line:90%
in eight years or so.

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you saying that we
basically have to deal with

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the sins of slavery,
the ghosts of--

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> --also the Native
American experience here?

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact of a lot of
genocide, a lot of trauma that

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.474 align:middle line:84%
has occurred,
you're saying these

00:05:51.474 --> 00:05:53.361 align:middle line:84%
are going to be addressed
in this turning.

00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
the movies again--

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.122 align:middle line:84%
"12 Years as a Slave,"
"Django Unchained."

00:05:58.122 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> "Birth of a Nation."

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.205 align:middle line:84%
>> "Birth of a Nation,"
you're seeing a return back

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to the reflecting on the Civil
War and the sins of the Civil

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
War and pre-Civil War
and the antebellum South.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.342 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, Black Lives
Matter rising up

00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
at this time and all of
that, that's not an accident.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.377 align:middle line:84%
That's a reflection
of the Turning.

00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
to deal with these things.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.543 align:middle line:84%
And it's just something
that we have to deal with.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And we can't run or shirk
our responsibilities.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
The Fourth Turning
is here, and it's

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be the biggest
of all the Turns.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know, some people look
at this as we're living in end

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:90%
times situation, right?

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I guess
you could argue

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that if you lived through
World War I or World War II,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
you would have thought that was
the end of the world, right?

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
But we have the trumpet--

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Trump is trumpet, maybe--

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Trump, right.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the revelations.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There are certain, you
know, conflicts and issues

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.916 align:middle line:90%
of dramatic global catastrophes.

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The climate change
may reflect really

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:84%
something that's more
of a world event than--

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
sorry, a natural occurring
world event than anything.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think we should
be looking for in these--

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, let's say if we
are living through end times,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
what should we be looking for,
and what dangers and risks

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:90%
are we facing?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think we're
living through end times,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:90%
first off.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.923 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody thinks they're
living through the end times.

00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And frankly it gets
tiring after a while.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But we do have big problems,
the acidification of the oceans.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:90%
We've got serious problems.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a pile of plastic in
the Pacific the size of Texas.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.075 align:middle line:90%
That has to be dealt with.

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And what you were talking
about with the Native Americans

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and African-American
populations,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
we have to rectify those sins.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to
do it in a positive way.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think with
African-Americans,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we really need to get
in and tackle the education

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.332 align:middle line:90%
system that they're under.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of
these things are

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:90%
going to go away, by the way.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we're going
to be paying $200,000 to go

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:90%
to college anymore.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to get
an MIT education online.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be free.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that
Congress is no longer

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
going to go to Washington.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
meet on the internet.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for them
to all go to Washington.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Stay home.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Get away from the slime in the
swamp there and the lobbyists,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and stay with your
constituents and your family.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.567 align:middle line:90%
And you meet on the internet.

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to do any of that.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're doing
a whole rethink right now

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
of everything we're doing.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a really good thing.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.622 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go more locally.

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
our food more locally.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make sure that
our water supplies are clean.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But we're also
going to be global.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have
electronic global culture

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
with an intrinsic
local culture, and it's

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.158 align:middle line:90%
going to be very interesting.

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think the world
that we're coming to,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm very optimistic, actually.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
People are very pessimistic
around me, but I'm not.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I think actually
things are better

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:90%
now than they've ever been.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:90%
There's fewer wars.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.848 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds
hard to believe.

00:08:42.848 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
There are fewer wars going
on right now than ever.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You have the education of
the world at your fingertips,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.514 align:middle line:90%
which is unbelievable.

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:52.305 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I
had to go to libraries.

00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:53.377 align:middle line:90%
I had to look up stuff.

00:08:53.377 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure it
all out for myself.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And now I've got
everything right

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:90%
at my fingertip on the internet.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.879 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're
all becoming more aware.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming aware
of what's in our food.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.253 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming aware of what the
corporations are doing to us.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming aware of
what Monsanto is up to.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.594 align:middle line:84%
And I think those things
are going to go away.

00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the revolution.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a revolution between
consciousness and unawareness.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It's almost this
techgnosis concept.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, in the old--

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.067 align:middle line:84%
you're an avid student
of alchemy, magic,

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and these practices.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that now the
technology and the internet,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.973 align:middle line:84%
these things are
basically bringing us

00:09:28.973 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:84%
to a place where the
magicians used to work.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
They would work in
the virtual domains.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They would work
action at a distance.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Over, you know, great distances
you could make things happen.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we can do those same
things thanks to the technology

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:90%
that's now becoming available.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, do you think
that we are essentially

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.729 align:middle line:84%
taking back the planet from
the magicians and the sorcerers

00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps have run things
for the last thousands of years?

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I think we've been living in
their universe, Spielberg's

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
universe, and
politicians' universe,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and these great magicians.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And Spielberg is a
magician for sure.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.985 align:middle line:84%
And I think now we're
emerging and we're

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
creating our own forms.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.922 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it kind
of irritates the powers

00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that be, because now I have
a camera that can do what

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Spielberg's cameras can do.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And I only paid $2,000 for it.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that's where
this is all going to emerge.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I think is really the
crux of the Fourth Turning--

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and I can't emphasize
this enough--

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and again, it's the internet
that's responsible for this.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go back to 1992,
which is about beginnings

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:90%
of the internet.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take like the first
eight years of the internet,

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
from 1992 to 2000.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was nothing
but conspiracy theories,

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
crazy facts running around.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was confused.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Nobody had the right narrative.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I say that that's very
similar to your first eight

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
years in school, where you're
just thrown a bunch of facts.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
They're teaching you stuff.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.226 align:middle line:84%
You don't know why they're
teaching it to you.

00:10:57.226 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly confusion.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But then in about
2000, aggregate sites

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
started up, like Drudge
and all these other sites.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
was they were guys

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
who had specialties in
information allocation.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we began
trusting aggregate sites

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to go through and sift
through everything

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and become our trusted guide
that would give us the stories

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:90%
that they had already vetted.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is what happens
also after about eight years

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:90%
in school.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You begin, hey, I want to
learn how to play the piano.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I want to learn
what physics is.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:31.975 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn this.

00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You start taking
the disparate facts

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and turning it into knowledge.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened around 2000.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And what really got it
going was, of course, 9/11,

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
when everybody
jumped in and started

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
citizens'
investigations, which I

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
don't think the powers that
be ever imagined would happen.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, our
process of maturation

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.526 align:middle line:84%
goes through facts,
knowledge, and finally wisdom.

00:11:56.526 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're
approaching right now.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We're taking all this
knowledge that we've

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
aggregated all
over the internet,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:90%
and we're becoming wise.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.117 align:middle line:90%
And this is the final act.

00:12:06.117 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we become wise,
we're going to say,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
hey, what are we doing
polluting our lands?

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing with
these nuclear weapons?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We're just a bunch of little
children beating each other up

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and playing with our toys.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's like time to stop.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:90%
This is dangerous.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.953 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where we're headed.

00:12:21.953 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is going to be
where the Fourth Turning ends

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
up, in a very wise world,
a world of very wise people

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.505 align:middle line:84%
who understand and discern
between the facts and the BS.

00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:34.192 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're headed.

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned
Spielberg as a magician,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and you say that
very definitively.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what is the
nature of movie "Magic"?

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.037 align:middle line:90%
I mean, does it affect--

00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
we know it obviously
affects our psychology,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and it affects our
spiritual state.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.926 align:middle line:84%
So you know how is this, what
is the actual device used

00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in this way, and what
is the intention,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
do you think, behind
the magicians using film

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:90%
for their magic?

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, film is a
fascinating art form in that it

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is projected onto a screen,
and we're sitting in the dark.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting
images and audio,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
which are feeding very
deep centers in our brain

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening,
but also what's happening

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is that film is the
closest art form to dreams.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when I watch a
film, the films I like

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
are the closest to dreams.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And, for instance, your father's
film "JFK," it's like a dream.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like this weird dream,
a strange, weird dream

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
with grains changing, and
resolution is changing.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me,
is a great film.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.994 align:middle line:84%
Because when I got done with the
film, I not only learned a lot,

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like I had
passed through this kind

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of dreamy atmosphere.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
I want from a film.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And Spielberg has that
dreaminess to him.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so does Stanley
Kubrick and a lot

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of the other great filmmakers.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.885 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I think it is,

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is that dreams influence
us more than we think.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think filmmakers realize
that the dreamier they make

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
their film, the more it will
get into our subconscious

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.525 align:middle line:90%
and have an influence on us.

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I applaud
great filmmaking

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:90%
because I know how hard it is.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.225 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, really
hard to make a good film.

00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned Kubrick,
and obviously you're a great

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:90%
student of his.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
The big question, you
know, the $20 million

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
question, did he fake
the Moon landing?

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Did he film that, what
we saw on television?

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was all
done by Stanley.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that they
didn't go to the Moon.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.904 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:39.904 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I've never been there.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But I know what they
showed us was fake,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you because I
can see the fingerprints of how

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:90%
they do it.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:10%
And I just happen to be an
expert in a process called

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.595 align:middle line:10%
front screen projection.

00:14:53.595 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:10%
And I was working with Richard
Hoagland in the early '90s,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:10%
and we were going to
all the NASA facilities

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:10%
and looking at all the
photographs and the video, what

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:10%
little video there was.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And I kept noticing
this strange something

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:84%
about the photographs
and the video,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in that everything
seemed to be in focus.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure
out how a 70 millimeter

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
camera, Hasselblad
with the long lens,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
could keep everything in focus.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
There was no creamy
backgrounds or anything.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything was sharp-- images
up front, images in back.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the first DVD
came out of "2001,"

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
so I was a naturally big fan.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I bought it.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I put it on my TV.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed the ape scenes
at the beginning of "2001"

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.037 align:middle line:84%
had, again, that same quality
where everything was in focus.

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that they were
front screen projection.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly how Stanley
had done those scenes.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They were all done
in the studio.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
He did it with huge
plates behind them,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well,
that is strange.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The same effect
is on the Apollo.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Then I went back to
the Apollo photographs,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and there was a tell-tale line
behind every single photograph.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's the line where
the set meets the screen.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a change in
granularity and everything

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
on this tell-tale line.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.442 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I'd nabbed it.

00:16:09.442 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I started going
through all the photographs,

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the signatures
were in every one of them.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that "2001"
was an R&D for the Apollo.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And that he was going to
work out all the techniques with

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Douglas Trumbull in "2001,"
and then he would apply that

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:90%
to the Apollo.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, everybody
can say that I'm wrong,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and I really don't care.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you watch "The
Shining," his movie

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
"The Shining"-- and by the way,
Stephen King agrees with me--

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
every time that he deviates
from the Stephen King novel,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.622 align:middle line:84%
he's telling you about
the Apollo, what he

00:16:46.622 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:90%
did during the Apollo launch.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.746 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying King
agrees with that theory.

00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes he does.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes he does.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> King is somebody who
believes Oswald killed Kennedy.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe that one.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
But no he knows there's
something terribly wrong

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
with "The Shining,"
with Kubrick's

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
version of "The Shining."

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.318 align:middle line:84%
And there's things
that are inexplicable.

00:17:02.318 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, Kubrick
absolutely insults

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Stephen King in the movie.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.089 align:middle line:84%
Stephen King in the book
has Jack driving a red

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Volkswagen. In the movie,
it's a yellow Volkswagen.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But as Hallorann is
going up to the overlook

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:84%
to save Danny and his mom,
he passes a car accident

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in which a semi has
crushed a red Volkswagen

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
flat into the ground.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's Stanley
telling Steven,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
this is what I think
of your vehicle.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Well-- oh, I see.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.911 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was going to mention
because King got hit--

00:17:35.911 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he did get hit.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> --many years later.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, speaking of Kubrick,
one other thing that's been

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:84%
mentioned about Kubrick is that
he has this ability to sort

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
of-- he had "The
Shining" himself.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:90%
That was what I have heard.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It was rumored that he actually
had his ability to see things,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that he had a psychic ability.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that he
predicted 9/11 with "2001"

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
in some capacity?

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell
you what I think.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I think he got
word from the mob.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I have pretty good evidence
that his early films were

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:90%
financed by the New York mob.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was really good
friends with Mel Brooks too,

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They both lived in
the Village very close

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to each other, both young
filmmakers in the '50s.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And personally I think
maybe Stanley was even

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
supplementing his income by
helping to shoot some porno

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and stuff at the time.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course we know the
mob is behind all the porno.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think he got word that
they were going to do something

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:90%
in 2001 or something.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because he changed the name
of the film from "Voyage

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to the Stars" to
"2001" in '67, which

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
was right when the
World Trade Center

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.347 align:middle line:84%
was decided by the
Port Commission

00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to build the World Trade Center.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was being built
during this whole period.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
evidence that there

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
wasn't that many businesses
inside the World Trade Center.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:10%
There's photographs
clearly taken

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:10%
which show that most of the
floors are completely empty.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:10%
So you really wonder what
the World Trade Center was.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:90%
What was it all about?

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And Mel Brooks also,
by the way, did

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
a "Get Smart" where
he wrote and directed

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in which he intimates that
he understands about "2001"

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and the collapse of
the buildings in 1967.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:90%
The two become one--

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:90%
2001.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Two become one.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Two becomes one.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.146 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just think of the
consciousness shift that "2001"

00:19:21.146 --> 00:19:23.485 align:middle line:84%
represented was a shift
to this digital virtual--

00:19:23.485 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes it was.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> --this digital age that
we have entered, right?

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That is exactly right.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> The new AI era.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
event of 9/11 which

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:90%
activated our consciousness.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We all wanted to know
what really happened.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:90%
We had the internet finally.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And we went for it.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And we found out.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And we also found out
that the powers that be

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:42.973 align:middle line:90%
were not going to tell us.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We had to find it all
out for ourselves.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
Millennium building,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:84%
it's shaped just like the
black monolith in "2001,"

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.447 align:middle line:84%
and it was christened
in early 2001.

00:19:53.447 --> 00:19:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, precisely.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So I mean, there's a direct
connection to the World Trade

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Center to Stanley
Kubrick's film.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.476 align:middle line:84%
>> So we just mentioned AI,
Artificial Intelligence,

00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
this new domain
of consciousness.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So I have to ask you about
the show "Westworld."

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I think I heard you're
a pretty big fan.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.871 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm curious to know
what it is that you believe

00:20:10.871 --> 00:20:12.995 align:middle line:84%
the messaging is that's
going on through that show.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I know Elon Musk is a
big adviser, for example,

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to the filmmakers on that.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I really
applaud Jonathan Nolan.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I think he's doing a
really wonderful job,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so happy that
the series is shot

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
on film, because I love film.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about
the gnostic journey,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the journey of gnosis or
knowledge, of us waking up.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And in this instance, he's
turned it around beautifully

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and made the AI is
waking up to the fact

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're not gods, just
like we are waking up.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:84%
In the gnostic texts, we
are waking up to the fact

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that the demi-urge or
Yahweh is not really god.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:90%
He's a fake god.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's faking
everything and so

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're fooled so that
he can take energy from us,

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The archons can
take energy from us

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and keep us kind of in a
semi-dilapidated conscious

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
Anthony Hopkins is doing.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.210 align:middle line:84%
He's the demi-urge
in "Westworld."

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's planting programs
within the AI to wake them up.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And the owner of
Westworld, who's Ed Harris,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
he's trying to find out what
Anthony Hopkins is really

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:90%
doing before it's too late.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:90%
But in the end it's too late.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:90%
They've woken up.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just a
beautiful series.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.392 align:middle line:84%
I've watched it twice now,
and I'd watch it a third time.

00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You mentioned this--

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.974 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not you
mentioned, but the idea

00:21:32.974 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
of waking up within the dream.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think back on
Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut,"

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
which is itself so powerful
in the sense of this

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
character's journey into
the elite circles of power

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and their sex rituals.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have a question
from David in New York.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:10%
And there has always
been this rumor, did WB--

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Warner Brothers-- request
that Kubrick make edits

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:10%
to the "Eyes Wide
Shut" sex party

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:10%
to basically
mitigate things that

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:10%
were shown within that
party, and apparently

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:10%
also the idea that it was based
on some Rothschild parties

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:10%
from the '70s?

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It was based.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'll believe that Kubrick
may have attended that party

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in particular, and that's
what he based that party on

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.905 align:middle line:90%
was the real one in '72.

00:22:12.905 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
definitely hanging

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:84%
with those guys in big
circles in London at the time.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:90%
But there was editing.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I knew-- I don't
know him anymore.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew his number one assistant,
and he was with Stanley

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
while the Warner Brothers
executives were watching "Eyes

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Wide Shut," the first cut.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And Kubrick had taken up smoking
again, which he had quit.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.085 align:middle line:84%
And he was 69 years old,
and he was chain smoking.

00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
they're going to hate it.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.002 align:middle line:90%
They're going to hate it.

00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:43.043 align:middle line:90%
They're going to kill me.

00:22:43.043 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
They're going to hate it,
over and over to himself.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.648 align:middle line:84%
Then he got called
in to this thing

00:22:46.648 --> 00:22:49.797 align:middle line:84%
after the screening, in which
there was a lot of screaming.

00:22:49.797 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can tell you.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and then they
demanded 18 minutes of cuts.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And Kubrick had a
contract that said

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't do that.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
He's the only filmmaker that
has a contract that nobody

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:90%
can cut his stuff.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And he refused, and then
he died five days later.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they removed
and definitely they cut.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.475 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if they
cut the sex scenes, though.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me that the
continuity errors which

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
are in "Eyes Wide
Shut," which are huge,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
gigantic continuity errors,
and Kubrick would never

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
do that unless they
were on purpose or stuff

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
was cut out in between
these continuity errors.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe that it
was all about MKUltra,

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:90%
that Cruise went on--

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I was told this, frankly,
by his assistant--

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that Cruise went on a voyage
to find out-- after the orgy--

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
was going on here.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered
the MKUltra programs.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there any description
of how that was portrayed?

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's just that
that was the script.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what irritated
the Warner Brothers.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there's no way of
finding the actual original--

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> They'll not release it.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I was the head of
a group of people

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.855 align:middle line:84%
who were Kubrick fans demanding
that Warner Brothers release

00:24:00.855 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
the unedited version,
and they will not do it.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.377 align:middle line:90%
No way, Jose, they said.

00:24:06.377 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we see in terms
of this power structure

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:90%
in Hollywood?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.764 align:middle line:84%
Is it ultimately a
military intelligence

00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
apparatus that's utilized
and that's really, I

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.365 align:middle line:84%
would say, controlling
the images that Hollywood,

00:24:16.365 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
the pictures that
Hollywood's able to create?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think what
happened was that--

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and I was part of this scene.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.485 align:middle line:90%
Actually your father was too--

00:24:23.485 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is that in the early '70s, there
was a rebellion in Hollywood.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of really cool
films started getting made.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they just put
the kibosh about '78

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.045 align:middle line:84%
on the whole thing and would not
let any more really cool films

00:24:36.045 --> 00:24:36.844 align:middle line:90%
released.

00:24:36.844 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
CIA said, that's it.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:90%
We have to take over.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And they began taking
over Hollywood,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:90%
and it was complete by '82, '83.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were pretty much--
there was still some freedom

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:90%
till about the mid-'90s.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
There were still some people
that had freedom to work,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:90%
like Kubrick, like your dad.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But most people, they
were under the thumb

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of this very powerful
group that was

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
going to make dang sure that
nobody released anything

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.190 align:middle line:90%
that was important.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And have you heard any rumors
or reports just about how they

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
can obviously have underground
facilities under studios where

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
they could even use
studios as fronts,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
as basically a front for
any kind of psychological

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
operation, you know,
mind control testing.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You can do a lot of things,
obviously, under the guise

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, it's just
a studio back lot.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.089 align:middle line:84%
Let's park some strange
equipment here and just

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:90%
say it's part of a movie.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard rumors
and reports like this?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I certainly have.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
things underground LA.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting rumor
is Dave McGowan's series

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
on Laurel Canyon, of which
I think he paid for his life

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:84%
by writing this because
he died at 43 years old.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about this
hotel, the Overlook Hotel,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
which was overlooking Los
Angeles at the top of Laurel

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Canyon.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It burned down in '75, but
there are pictures of it,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.405 align:middle line:84%
and it looks just like the
hotel in "The Shining."

00:25:54.405 --> 00:25:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It's exact duplicate
of the hotel

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick chose in
"The Shining," so I think

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Stanley was actually working
and inside this hotel, which

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a hotel.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a CIA operation,
which was essentially

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
running Hollywood and the
music scene from this place.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.985 align:middle line:84%
And Frank Zappa lived like
two blocks away from it.

00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it Lookout Mountain?

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lookout Mountain, that's it.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:14.823 align:middle line:84%
And Frank Zappa lived
about two blocks away,

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and Frank Zappa
told me in '88, he

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
said the whole thing
was run by the CIA.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.531 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, come on.

00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no,
no, the whole thing

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
is being run by the CIA
right out of Laurel Canyon.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, no.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> But he told you this.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> He told me this, yeah.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well one thing I
have to tell you--

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And then he died.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:10%
>> One thing I have to tell you
about Lookout Mountain is that

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:10%
it segues from Wonderland.

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it does.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Wonderland, Through
the Looking Glass,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:10%
right next to each other.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely it does, and
I used to live on Wonderland

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Avenue, so I know you're right.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:10%
I know the whole area very
well, and it's really spooky.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a 1938
article from the LA Times

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
about the tunnel
systems that are

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
all under LA that were there
before the white people

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:90%
ever arrived.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> The native legends.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, native legends, and
there's even, in the story,

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:90%
talk about reptiles in these.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And I can't believe this.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
They're like, really,
an LA Times story

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
saying there was
reptiles living under LA?

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can pull out the
article and show it to you.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe Morrison was the
lizard king after all.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well,
you've got to wonder.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
His dad was the guy behind
the Tonkin Gulf incident.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:84%
He was the admiral that
ran the whole thing.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.635 align:middle line:84%
So you got to wonder who
Jim Morrison really was.

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> McGowan's book
is a must-read.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes it is.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us quickly, what is the
upcoming show on Gaia with Jay

00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Dyer that you're doing?

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> "Hollywood Decoded," we're
going to tear the cover off

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood and the
shamanic mysteries and magic

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood and show you what
they're really doing to us.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be awesome.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a must-see for sure.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I would love that.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Heat it up.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you so much
for joining me today, Jay.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I really
appreciate your time.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.833 align:middle line:84%
And there you have it,
folks, fascinating insights

00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
from Jay Weidner.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.016 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge
you to check out

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:52.340 align:middle line:10%
his website, JayWeidner.com,
and his new show coming out here

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
but it requires
constant reassessment.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and you are the revolution.
