00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Are we living in the dream?

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.706 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:05.650 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:17.379 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And with me today is
Paul Levy, a pioneer

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
in the field of
spiritual emergence,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:10%
as well as an innovator
in the field of dreaming.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
A Tibetan Buddhist
practitioner for over 30 years,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:84%
he has intimately
studied with some

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest spiritual
masters of Tibet and Burma.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:10%
He is the author of "The Madness
of George Bush, a Reflection

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:10%
of Our Collective Psychosis,"
as well as "Dispelling Wetiko,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:10%
Breaking the Curse of Evil."

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Today, he shares
with us his insights.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So your website is called
Awaken in the Dream, which

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of the Thoreau
quote, Our truest life

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
is when we are in dreams awake."

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So is life a dream? /
Is there any reality

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:90%
that is external to our minds?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well,
that's the question.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.399 align:middle line:10%
And I began having this
experience 35 years ago

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:10%
that got me in a lot
of trouble at the time

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:10%
because I wasn't integrated.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But I was basically
having the realization

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that this is a collectively
shared dream that all of us

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:90%
are creating moment by moment.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.744 align:middle line:84%
And what the problem
is is that we

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
recognition of that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
so we then become entranced
by that display of the dream,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and then think that it's
objective and real and separate

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and solid from ourselves.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And we react to our projections
and become conditioned by them

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:90%
in a way that actually traps us.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.151 align:middle line:84%
So for however many decades,
I've been trying to get out.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, no, this is like
a collectively shared dream

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that once you recognize that
and stabilize that realization,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:90%
that changes everything.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps
you to get in touch

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
with this incredible power,
this creative power we

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:90%
have to change the dream.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's almost the Nine
Inch Nails song about all

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.305 align:middle line:84%
your gods, your
phantoms and your gods,

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the living and the dead,
they're all in your head.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's essentially you're
really all alone here.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it's that?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it ultimately that?

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.146 align:middle line:84%
Is it each one of us is really
just alone in this reality?

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that no,
actually, our aloneness

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
is actually a connection
to everyone else being

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
one, in a sense, there's
a oneness involved.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very
simplistic to say, oh,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
it's all just our
own projection,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:90%
all just our imagination.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all just our own mind.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
In the sense that
that's true, but also,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
what needs to be
taken into account

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is that from the
subjective point of view,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.404 align:middle line:84%
we experience whether
it's our demons or gods

00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
from the phenomenological
point of view,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:90%
as if they actually exist.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So that needs to be, I
think, taken into account,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that subjectively we experience
them, the inner forces,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
as if they actually have
an objective existence.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately speaking, there
is no intrinsic, independent--

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing there
except our own imagination.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're both
true, even though they

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%
seem to be contradictory.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, people
have, throughout history

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and to the present day,
experienced aliens and demonic

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
entities, ghosts,
phantoms, you name it.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.145 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of
mystical experiences.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
these are ultimately

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
projected from potentially
the imagination or parts

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of the mind?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.209 align:middle line:84%
But what about the unconscious
aspect of our mind?

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah,
well, the unconscious,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
which is so powerful--

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea that this
being a dream.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are dreams?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're direct unmediated
expressions of the unconscious.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and the thing is,
it's like when you have a dream,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
it's like this other part
of us, the unconscious,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
is trying to communicate with
this other part of us that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
actually is, you could say,
identified with a reference

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:90%
point, with the ego.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is some communication
going between the two.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
What the meaning of that
is that to see this being

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
some sort of dream is
to realize that it's

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of a
symbol, that everything

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.894 align:middle line:90%
is speaking symbolically.

00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And the thing which is
interesting about, even

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
etymologically,
the word "symbol,"

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
it means to bring
together, where

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:84%
it's the antonym for
"diabolic," which is to sever

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and to divide.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So the whole point
is that to deal

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with the evil or the
diabolical or whatever

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
you would call the
darker energies, the way

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to deal with it is to
recognize the dreamlike nature

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and then to have that
symbolic awareness.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
That actually is in the
service of our wholeness,

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and to dispel the darkness.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right, because one
of the problems I always notice

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
with the New Age community and
this idea of The Secret was

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
if you just put your mind to
something, you can attract it.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.573 align:middle line:84%
They're not accounting for the
power of the unconscious, which

00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I think is really what a
lot of the magic and a lot

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:84%
of our reality
that we've created

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
is actually more projected
from the unconscious more

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:90%
than our conscious.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.014 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all
would love to live

00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
in a happier world with
more goods and more things

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and basically in peace and joy.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously not
the conscious mind

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:90%
that's creating it.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.493 align:middle line:84%
It's the unconscious that
seems to be creating it.

00:05:31.493 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, getting
back to The Secret, I mean,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll hear people who will
be doing these affirmations

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.776 align:middle line:84%
of that-- oh, whatever
the affirmation would be.

00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I hear the opposite
of what they're

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
saying because
they're saying that

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
as this reaction with reference
to dealing with the darkness.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
these darker forces,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
which are the shadow, the
archetypal personal shadow that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
are all part of us, is that
if we don't add consciousness

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to the shadow, then
we're unwittingly

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
empowering the very
thing that we're avoiding

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and not wanting to look at.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So you talk about essentially
confronting the shadow,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:90%
being conscious of the shadows.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's oftentimes
what I find

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:84%
about people who are so
logical and analytical

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and certain about the
nature of reality.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though,
this is the way things are.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Science says it's this way.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm certain of that.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
It's as though they're really
denying a tremendous aspect

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.619 align:middle line:84%
of their own mind, which is the
shadow side, which is almost

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the Heisenberg paradox,
where you can never

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.609 align:middle line:84%
be certain of both the speed and
the location of the particle.

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
We can't be certain of reality.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Even in this very
moment, it's shifting.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So the reality that people
speak of, oftentimes, it's

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
as though they're trying
to basically create

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
a paradigm within
they have to live.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
trauma always occurs.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Chaos always occurs.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Tragedy always occurs
when people are not

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
ready to basically
embrace the shadow

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
elements, the demons,
the dark side that

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:90%
is innate to this existence.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I come across that all
the time with people who are

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
just overly identified
with the light.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.687 align:middle line:84%
And they're so terrified
of the darkness

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
that they don't even want to put
any of their attention on it.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But by them having the
reactivity and that being

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
in avoidance of the
darkness, like I was saying,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:90%
they're unwittingly feeding it.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point
is that who are we?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.757 align:middle line:84%
We're like a hologram, like
a full spectrum hologram

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that includes all
the colors from dark

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to light and
everything in between.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And if any part of that
we don't deal with,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
then we're feeding that.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And it'll manifest
in a negative way.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:90%
That's guaranteed.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:07:53.397 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you wrote
your book on George Bush.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he's a reflection
of our collective psychosis.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, looking
at the Trump phenomenon,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, it's
not to say he's all bad,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
but he oftentimes reflects
language that is fear-based,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:90%
that is bigoted.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you see this uprising,
as what's occurring now,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
as almost like our darkest
shadows are, in a sense,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.036 align:middle line:84%
being projected
on the big screen.

00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is not just Trump.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a global thing
with fear of Islam,

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
global war, conflict with
Russia, China, you name it.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.254 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it feel
like we are basically

00:08:27.254 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
looking at this collective
expression of the shadow?

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, one
way to understand it,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
from my point of view, is when
you see this as being like

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
a dream--

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
when you have a dream and
you don't get the message,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a recurring dream,
and not only a recurring dream,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
but it tends to be more
amplified up until you actually

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:90%
get the message.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So there is deep darkness
that's manifesting in our world.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But the point I want to make
is that from the dreaming point

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
of view, it's clear that here
is this incredible darkness,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's not hiding in the
corners or underground.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
It's fully visible.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It's out.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's an expression.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
When there is such
intense darkness,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that's an expression that
there is light nearby

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
that's casting the shadow.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it's potentially,
like in quantum speak,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
a real opportunity if we
have the recognition what's

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:90%
being shown to us.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.207 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't have that
recognition, then guaranteed,

00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
compelled to just continue

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to destroy ourselves because
we're actually committing,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
collectively, a form of
suicide as a species.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, so this gets into the
question of what is the wetiko,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
because obviously, you delve
into this issue of is there

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
almost a mind parasite, or
a curse upon mankind that is

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
keeping us in this position
of constant unconsciousness,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
lack of reflection, inability
to break from the past,

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
the past traumas, to basically
heal and mend and move forward.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it boils down to?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And just to create context, how
I first came upon the wetiko

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:90%
energy was in my family.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:90%
My father was a really sick man.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And I'm the only child that--

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go into the story.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But he acted out
his darkness onto me

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.705 align:middle line:84%
and onto a lot of people,
but I was the main recipient.

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But the thing which
caught my attention

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:90%
was that the whole field--

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:84%
the family system, the
mental health community--

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
they all configured to
protect the darkness,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:90%
to protect my father.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And the whole while, I was
tracking this and realizing,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
wow, there's a
deeper process here.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
there's a field that's

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.650 align:middle line:84%
becoming visible through
what was playing out

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:90%
in my family system.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to
realize, oh, that's exactly

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in the greater
body politic of our world.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's such a helpful
idea, the wetiko psychosis.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a collective psychosis.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's an indigenous term.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And it really connotes
the spirit of real evil.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet, like I point
out in my book again

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and again, encoded in
wetiko, in the evil,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:90%
is actually it has a blessing.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's actually helping
us to wake up.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't have
the recognition of what

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
it's showing us, like
I was saying before,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
then we're just
going to continue

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to be compelled to
destroy ourselves,

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
which is what we're doing.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me about what is
the actual origin of the wetiko

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:90%
as a concept?

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, keep in mind,
so it's a Native American term,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's in every
spiritual tradition,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and not only in
spiritual traditions,

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
but even so many of these
creative artists are pointing

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:90%
at it in their own creative way.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And the point is is that
just experientially,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:90%
there's something in us--

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and the origin of the
wetiko is the psyche.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not external.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not like any sort of
external parasite or something

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The origin of it
is inside of us.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an energy that's
actually kind of adversarial,

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
in this adversarial way with
reference to our own light,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.772 align:middle line:84%
with reference to
our own creativity.

00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The self-destructive
force in us then.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, and there's
such a fine line between being

00:12:12.855 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
creative and being
self-destructive.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
If we don't express
you we are creatively,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
it turns back in
a self-destructive

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.640 align:middle line:90%
or other destructive way.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:29.374 align:middle line:84%
And so the indigenous people,
they coined the term "wetiko."

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not even
attached to that.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:90%
There's a zillion terms.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Every spiritual tradition
has their particular name

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:90%
or a symbol system for it.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's really pointing at that
there is something in us that

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
seems to be some form of
obscuration or obstacle

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
towards us actually
fulfilling our full potential.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I'm pointing
at is that instead

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of that just being, oh,
that's a negative thing.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, when you look
at the deeper process,

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:84%
it's actually in service of
our evolution as a species.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
If wetiko didn't exist, we
would have to invent it.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's that important.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But is it something that you
think is almost part of human

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
blood in the sense of our
DNA, our genetic memory?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
There is this whole
theory, psychology,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
that basically we're carrying
a lot of the psychoses,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the traumas, a lot
of the pains and memories

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:90%
of our ancestors in our DNA.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that linked to to the
power and the charge?

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:84%
That's very much
one aspect of it,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%
about how unresolved
trauma gets passed down

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
through the generations, through
the ancestry and all that.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.642 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if I
haven't healed my trauma,

00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going unconsciously
act it out and transmit it

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.205 align:middle line:84%
to my kids or my
partner or whatever.

00:13:49.205 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it
begins to propagate.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are all these theories
about, oh, these negative ETs,

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
or we have this collective
trauma so many years ago

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm open to that.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But all that I know is
that in the present moment,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
we, ourselves, are complicit in
each moment in either creating

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
wetiko or actually
dispelling it.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm pointing at
is that the present moment

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is the portal through which
we can get our hands actually

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.547 align:middle line:90%
into it, in a way, to dispel it.

00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because you mentioned
about your own family and this

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
dealing with addiction
and how, in a sense,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
people become addicted
to their addictions.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a pattern.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is we create
bad patterns in the--

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It becomes a
self-perpetuating feedback

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
loop.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, just think about
whether we're in trauma

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:84%
or have an addiction, when
we're in trauma, the way

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.735 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to heal my
trauma is actually creating

00:14:50.735 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the very trauma that
I'm trying to heal

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.595 align:middle line:84%
from in a self-generated
feedback loop.

00:14:54.595 --> 00:14:55.814 align:middle line:90%
And that's insanity.

00:14:55.814 --> 00:14:57.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the idea,
we've been bombed,

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
go and bomb back.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.634 align:middle line:84%
It's a never-ending
cycle of violence.

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's just going
to create more terrorists.

00:15:02.758 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It's pouring fuel on the fire.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent
that we're asleep,

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:90%
we don't recognize that.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm pointing
at with my work

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
higher dimension

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
in which the third dimension
is enfolded within.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And if we're just focused
on what's actually

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
happening physically
in the third dimension,

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
we're actually, in a sense,
being hypnotized by the display

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:90%
without seeing.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
point out-- so I just

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
wrote this book on
physics, quantum physics,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:90%
as a dreaming process.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.522 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main insights
of quantum physics--

00:15:42.522 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a
whole bunch of them--

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is that physicists, up until
the discovery of the quantum,

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
in studying physical
reality, it was

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%
like they were studying these--

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
they were in Plato's cave and
they were studying the shadows

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, thinking it was
reality, without realizing

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.559 align:middle line:90%
what's casting the shadow.

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
pointing at, that there

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
is a higher dimension
whose origin is the psyche,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:90%
is inside of us.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I can say one more
amazing thing about wetiko,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
it's an inner
disease of the soul.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a psychospiritual disease
of the soul that actually

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
explicates itself through the
medium of the outside world

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:90%
in a synchronistic way.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:22.465 align:middle line:90%
And that's amazing.

00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you just think
about that for a moment.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's something inside of
us that's actually somehow

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%
able to configure events in the
world in a synchronistic way

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
so as to reflect back what's
going on inside of us.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, to the extent
that we don't see that,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.680 align:middle line:84%
we then react to
our projections,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's objective
and separate and all that.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
are fueling wetiko.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But if we actually had the
recognition-- oh, what's

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
actually happening out
there is symbolically

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
reflecting something
in us, that's

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to recognize
the dream-like nature

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.746 align:middle line:90%
and to awaken.

00:16:55.746 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We have A question
from one of our viewers.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:10%
Zephyr from Nebraska asks
if you consider humans,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.209 align:middle line:10%
in the words of Graham Hancock,
"a species with amnesia?"

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is an
important question because we're

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:10%
talking about the
fact that we've

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:10%
been so trapped
by our addictions

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:10%
and our reactive state,
it's as though we've

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:10%
forgotten as humans--

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:10%
we've forgotten to learn from
our past mistakes and traumas

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:10%
to basically grow beyond it.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we are a
species with amnesia?

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in my
quantum physics book,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:84%
one of the chapters is called
"Geniuses with Amnesia,"

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that our nature is that
we're these geniuses,

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
but we've forgotten.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And from the shamanic point
of view, in other words,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
all of our different parts
have been dismembered,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to do is
to remember who we are.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And the point it is that we
can actually help each other

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, if I could just say one--

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so
interested in trying

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.939 align:middle line:84%
to get across this
whole idea of wetiko

00:17:58.939 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:90%
because it's so profound.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, it's
a form of being blind.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a psychic blindness.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's a particular
form of psychic blindness

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.922 align:middle line:84%
that, actually, it
believes that it's sighted.

00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But not only does it
believe that it's sighted,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
but it believes it's
more sighted than people

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.602 align:middle line:90%
who are actually seeing.

00:18:16.602 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's the one eye.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual
traditions, they

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.344 align:middle line:90%
say the one eye is the devil.

00:18:20.344 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, it
could be the one eye

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
that assumes that it's seeing
with both eyes, or even--

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> --mistakes the left eye
for the third eye in a sense.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, right, right,
that's really interesting. .

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing is
what wetiko does,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
it somehow inspires us
to put our attention

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves and think
the problem is out there.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it feeds off
of being polarized.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
If we're like, oh,
Muslims are bad,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or Donald Trump is
this, or whatever,

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
by having a polarized
point of view,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
then we're feeding
wetiko, and it's actually

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:90%
inspiring the polarization.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually
have the recognition

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're having
a dream right now,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
well, then who is Donald
Trump, for example?

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
He's a dream character, which
means he's a reflection.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.086 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
I tried to write

00:19:05.086 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
about in the book about the
madness of Bush is that yeah,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
we think of him as separate.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, then we're feeding wetiko.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But if we actually
have the recognition--

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, he's reflecting
this part of us,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
however we would
characterize it,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
then we're beginning to wake
up and to dispel wetiko.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I wanted
to really get across,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:84%
going back to this
being a dream,

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
say, if you're actually
in a night dream,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and you hold a
particular perspective

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:90%
in that night dream.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is the night dream?

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's your own mind.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a reflection,
projection of your own mind.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So if I hold the perception,
the dream, it just has no choice

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
but to reflect back whatever
viewpoint I'm holding.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But if I change my
perspective, instantaneously--

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
not in one second or half a
second, in no time at all--

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the dream will shape shift
and reflect back my change

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:90%
in perspective.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm holding a particular
perspective in a dream,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:84%
then the dream will
supply all the evidence

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to prove to me the
seeming objective

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:90%
truth of that viewpoint.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.419 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have all the
evidence so that I

00:20:14.419 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
can get even more entrenched,
and that's actually

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.384 align:middle line:90%
objectively true.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
hold that, the more

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
it reflects back
the objective truth.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the feedback loop.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's plugging into our
own incredible brilliance

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
and talent for creating reality.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're turning it
against ourselves.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
It certainly fits
into my perspective

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.949 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, which is
that we are each creators,

00:20:35.949 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and that if we don't tap into
that creativity within us,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:90%
we self-destruct.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
a big issue that we

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.558 align:middle line:84%
face throughout human
history is the fact

00:20:42.558 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that we've stifled
that creative impulse

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and replaced it with
the logical, mundane,

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:84%
almost you could say
roboticized reality that we have

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to live through, as opposed
to the creative, inspired,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
exciting adventure that reality
can be when we're creative.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the time
period, because we're

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
seeing such a
bipolarity, do you think

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that what we're having
to face is essentially

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:84%
the consequence of full
bipolarity, is ultimately,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
a unity that will be
after this darkness?

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:90%
What is coming?

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
What is man working towards?

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it all depends.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:84%
In quantum style,
it's potentially that.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
opportunity for us

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to get to a higher
place of integration

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
if we recognize what's
actually happening.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, just going back to the
thing about quantum physics,

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the major insights
of quantum physics--

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've
empirically shown,

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.366 align:middle line:84%
without the slightest
shadow of a doubt,

00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that there's no such
thing as objective reality

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that's in any way having any
separation from the observer.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that through
our act of observing reality,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
we're invoking the reality
that we're observing.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And what the
implication of that is

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
is that we are creative beings.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:90%
We're creator beings.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But we've disconnected
from that part.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And by having that split and
not being fully congruent

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
with being this
creative being, that

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
opens the doorway
for wetiko, then,

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to plug in to our own
creativity because it

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.727 align:middle line:90%
has no creativity at all--

00:22:15.727 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a parasite, essentially.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a parasite
of the mind though.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.182 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of it as a physical,
third-dimensional parasite.

00:22:22.182 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a higher
dimensional parasite

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:90%
whose origin is inside of us.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually, ultimately,
it's helping us.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Like I've been
trying to say, it's

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
force for evolution.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't recognize
that, then we're

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:90%
just going to destroy ourselves.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> In a sense, the parasite
makes you stronger.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Because by being able
to expel it ultimately,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.074 align:middle line:84%
now you've hit a new evolution
within your mind consciousness.

00:22:42.074 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not
just expelling it.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:45.323 align:middle line:84%
It's also from the
alchemical point of view,

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
being able to transmute
that negative,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:90%
that evil into medicine.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The thing about wetiko,
it's a quantum phenomena

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in that it's the source
of the deepest evil

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that our species
enacts on each other,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's the most incredible
medicine and blessing

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
that we could ever imagine.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But like in quantum
physics, well,

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is light going to manifest
as a wave or a particle?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.384 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how we observe it.

00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the same thing.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, the transmutation.

00:23:15.425 --> 00:23:18.464 align:middle line:84%
From the dung, the
plants, the food grows.

00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
there was a time

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
that humans lived more in right
balance with their environment,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:90%
with nature?

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, the age
of the pyramid builders,

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of,
for example, there's

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
indication there was more
of a flow in a sense of how

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
we understood our
reality as being--

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:84%
they called it bicameral
mind when the god

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
spoke to us, for example.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would imagine
that that's true,

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that there was a time
in the past like that.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But also, I imagine, that maybe
that our species back then

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the full
capacity we have

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:90%
of language or consciousness.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to adjust
in an idealized way

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to think, oh, yeah, way
back when, everybody was

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:90%
living in harmony with nature.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, that might be true to
some degree or full degree.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But also, there's
a shadow element

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that they hadn't really
developed consciousness

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.574 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that
maybe we have right now.

00:24:11.574 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is
what's playing out.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
shadows of the past

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:15.763 align:middle line:84%
are what's playing
out in our present.

00:24:15.763 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But from the shadows,
from the darkness,

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
we can create a new
reality going forward.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing
about the darkness,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
just from the psychological
point of view--

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:90%
think about it.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:90%
In one person's process--

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
if I go to my analyst and
there's this incredible shadow

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that I'm dealing with, one
aspect might be personal,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
but another aspect might be
archetypal-- in other words,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.977 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
the collective.

00:24:39.977 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And just from a
psychological point of view,

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, that shadow,
that's the source

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
of this incredible individuation
that can come out of it.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just would love
to ask the question

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:84%
whether that's a parallel,
whether that same thing is true

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
collectively,
whether in a species

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
or in a society, where there
is such incredible shadow

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that's actually taking form in
the greater body politic right

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
now, whether encoded in that
is this incredible potentiality

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:90%
for a deeper awakening.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of feel that
that's really true.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So based on your work,
based on your research,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.960 align:middle line:84%
how do you advise people
to dispel the wetiko?

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
How do they embrace
and individuate

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:90%
with that shadow side?

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, why don't you
ask me some easy question?

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And that is the question.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number of things
that I'll try to point out.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
one of the ways wetiko

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:84%
works-- so say we'll
see the evil out there

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:84%
in whatever form, whoever it
is or whatever is playing out.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And what typically happens,
because it's not just

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:84%
out there, but it's also
interfacing with our psyche--

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
we'll get triggered.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a reaction.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:90%
So right there is a doorway.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Instead of focusing our
attention outside of ourselves,

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
which then, we're not fully
in connection with ourselves,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:90%
but to actually self-reflect.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
opportunity to inquire

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
into what inside of us at that
moment is being triggered.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:90%
So that would be one thing.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Second thing is in
any way any of us

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
could access being creative
because the thing about wetiko,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:90%
it's an archetypal energy.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't actually
constructively, consciously,

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
creatively express it,
like we've been saying,

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.620 align:middle line:90%
it turns self-destructive.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is any form
of art or creative expression,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:84%
incredibly, not only helps,
but it empowers ourselves.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing
about wetiko, you see,

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
it can't stand to be seen.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So like I was saying,
it's a form of blindness.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it operates
through our projections,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:84%
through the projective
tendencies of our mind.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the unconscious has these
spots that are blind spots.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it operates
through the blind spots.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:90%
So it operates through us.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
We become the instrument
through which it incarnates.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, it hides
itself from being seen.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So to actually see
how that's happening,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:90%
that also dispels wetiko.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Shining a mirror
on it, basically,

00:27:17.837 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
turning the mirror on it
to see itself in a sense?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah well,
the mirror, etymologically,

00:27:22.128 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
it means "the holder
of the shadow."

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:84%
When you see it out
there, if you still

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:84%
become, like I was
saying, entranced

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
by it being outside
of us, then we're

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.081 align:middle line:84%
feeling wetiko through
that very viewpoint.

00:27:33.081 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But if we have the
recognition-- oh,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
what I'm seeing actually
has to do with me--

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I guess
one other thought

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is any way we're
able to really tap

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:84%
into compassion, to
real, genuine compassion,

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.556 align:middle line:84%
because compassion is an
expression of actually having

00:27:51.556 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the recognition of the dreamlike
nature, which means that we're

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
characters in each other's
dreams, which means that we're

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
not separate, that we're
actually interconnected,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:90%
interdependent.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And the energetic expression of
that realization is compassion.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's beautifully put.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I think your right.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:10%
I mean, compassion, mercy,
these are the tools basically

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:10%
by which we can actually start
to reconcile and ultimately

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:10%
overcome the traumas of the
past that really have locked us

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:10%
into these patterns
that you point out,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:10%
that wetiko feeds on.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I told the other thing
about the trauma of the past.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:10%
So the thing about wetiko,
it's a collective psychosis

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.507 align:middle line:10%
that's actually acting itself
out all over the world.

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it freaks me out that
very few people are even

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
talking about that.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle of
a collective psychosis.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But I want to compliment
that by saying,

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and our species is in trauma.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:90%
We're all suffering from PTSD.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But encoded-- like the
other thing, because I've

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
learned this so much from
what happened with my father

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
because I was deeply
traumatized by him acting out

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:90%
his unhealed abuse onto me.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, it made
me an expert on trauma

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because I was so
completely traumatized.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still a
work in progress.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But the thing which
is so interesting

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is that in trauma, there is
the compulsion to repeat.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.659 align:middle line:84%
And the repulsion to
repeat is actually

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:84%
recreating the very trauma
we are trying to heal,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:90%
from like I was saying.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But also, encoded
in that impulse

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to compulsively
repeat the trauma,

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.967 align:middle line:84%
we're actually trying
to unlock something.

00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We're actually trying
to discharge something

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:90%
or to integrate something.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thank you so much for
coming on and joining me today.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your time.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's totally my pleasure.

00:29:36.381 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sean.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:29:38.835 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
There you have it, folks,
fascinating insights

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:90%
from Paul Levy.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
agree with or believe

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:90%
everything said here today.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.301 align:middle line:84%
So I urge you to check out his
website, awakeninthedream.com.

00:29:47.301 --> 00:29:50.220 align:middle line:10%
It's online and has
plenty of details

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:10%
and more information
about his work.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path,

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:90%
one on the buzz saw's edge.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It requires constant
reassessment.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.872 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:29:58.872 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.
