>>SEAN STONE: What do the
spiritual masters mean when

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.540 align:middle line:90%
they say, we die before we die?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.097 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.435 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw."

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
We cut through the
mainstream narrative

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.794 align:middle line:84%
to explore the twilight
zones of reality.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me, today,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:10%
is Cyndi Dale, internationally
renowned author, speaker,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and healer.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.446 align:middle line:84%
She's been trained in several
different healing modalities

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
including shamanism,
intuitive energy

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
healing, therapeutic touch,
family of origin therapy,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Lakota Way.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:10%
Her book, "Journey After Life"
illuminates the soul's journey

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:10%
from before we were born,
through our lifetimes,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:10%
and into the afterlife.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi offers us
meditations and guidance

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
for readying ourselves for the
adventure that we call death.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So Cyndi, I want to start by
asking you, what do you mean by

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.489 align:middle line:90%
"we die before we die?"

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.113 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI DALE: Isn't
that a great quote?

[LAUGHING]

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.483 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: You're like, I
have no idea what it means.

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: I don't-- it's not a
suicidal pact or anything like

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:10%
that.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we
talk about dying

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.398 align:middle line:84%
before we die,
we're really talking

00:01:14.398 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
about our ego, or that part of
ourselves that believes itself

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
separate from other
people, from the world,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
from what happens after we
die, from the great light,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
or the clear light that
Tibetans like to call it.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we're much more
prepared to die and take

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
advantage of being
death, you know,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to really transcend
in the way that we're

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be able to,
if we work with our ego

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
while we're alive.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody's
scared of death.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think I'm more scared
of dying than the actual post

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:90%
death component.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that if
we really so-called

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
work the issues of who we
believe we are rather than who

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
we really are, then we really
are ready to release ourselves

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
or be released when it's time
to be done with this body

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.652 align:middle line:90%
and go further.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Your book,
"Journey After Life--"

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
it deals with insights into
the world beyond the veil,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are these insights
collected from your work

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
as a healer or are you
remembering aspects

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.587 align:middle line:90%
of your soul's journey?

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'd say it's
more remembering.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Really?

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I was one
of those weird kids.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm probably still--

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm still a weird adult
to be really honest.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:10%
But as a youngster, I
remembered past lives.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I remembered where
I was immediately

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
before I came into
this little baby body.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.924 align:middle line:84%
I even have memories of when
I was in my mother's womb.

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like
it so much, so I

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
kept going back to where
I was, and then returning

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:90%
into the womb state.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think I came with a lot
of memories still intact.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me some
interesting views

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
when I looked at people,
especially when I was really

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
young, or I was
at a funeral, or I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
was talking to ghosts
or spirits, which

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do when
I was really small.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:90%
So I think I remember a lot.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think the rest
of it has really

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
been gathered by some research
and by my clients' stories.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with maybe
65,000 clients at this point.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
This book was written
quite a bit ago,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
but I'd still worked
with a lot of people.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So they have their
own stories, which

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I've gathered onto myself, too.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you'd
say that there is

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.296 align:middle line:84%
sort of a universal
experience of going

00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:22.045 align:middle line:84%
into the afterlife,
near-death experience,

00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not just our own minds
creating it-- the effect.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I think so.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:10%
I know there's some
recent research that

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:10%
is showing that the brain
stays alive far longer

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:10%
then after it stops.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And it emanates certain
types of energy,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:84%
which we could call light,
that could give people

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:90%
death experiences.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But what people report,
whether it's through near-death

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
experiences or
spiritualities or--

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I've had three near-death
experiences, myself--

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
or what people go through
and what they remember

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
goes far beyond what
science can explain.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a limitation
of the brain.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So I think
it is universal--

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
especially when you look at
some of the ancient manuscripts

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and how they describe
what comes next.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding
out through science

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
and the frontier of the mind--

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
very, very similar.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So as far as the
frontier of the mind,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.221 align:middle line:84%
we also have to
reference the past--

00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
books like "The Tibetan
Book of the Dead,"

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Egyptian Book
of the Dead"--

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
both of which I think
were initiation rights

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for death
and the afterlife.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of emphasis was placed on
that in these ancient cultures.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.717 align:middle line:84%
So how does your book
play into that tradition?

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I have
read those books.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
I've studied them.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have to admit that
I put most of my book

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
together before I
re-read the books.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I found, wow, these
are really similar.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the main
ideas dovetail.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was one
of those geeky 15,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
16-year-olds who got a
hold of those manuscripts

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
because I was
fascinated with death.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I could see spirits.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I could see ghosts.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
what other cultures,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
besides the Christian
culture, was saying occurs.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So I have knowledge of that
going into the writing,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.156 align:middle line:90%
but a lot of what's--

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
books talk about is

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.856 align:middle line:84%
very similar to my
experiences and others.

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
"The Tibetan Book of
the Dead," for instance,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
is also known as "The
Great Book of Liberation."

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
teaching somebody

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're alive, how to
manage their soul when they're

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:90%
dead--

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
really so they don't
have to come back.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Tibetans
believe that after 49 days,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
unless we are embraced by, or
we can embrace what they call

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
the primary light,
or the clear light,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
we just have to return here
and keep working on our ego.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
We just have to get
to the point where

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.992 align:middle line:84%
we're willing to sort of
dissolve into the oneness.

00:05:39.992 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, we
just have to keep

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:90%
practicing through the body.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian soul-- "The
Egyptian Book of the Dead"

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is really a collection
of spells, which I think

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:90%
is sort of interesting.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's magic spells
that you have to escape--

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're magic spells.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --in order to
pass the different tests--

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --to not be
destroyed at the end of it.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right, exactly.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Right, so you can
get to the Lily

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Lake and the Field of Reeds and
it's very, very complicated.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I could remember
all those spells once I'm dead.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember
them when I'm alive.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Rehearsal.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:90%
We're rehearsing.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But the basic ideas of those
manuscripts and many others,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
even what Jesus
was talking about,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
where we need a second
birth while we're alive.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We need to have a rebirth--

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, a spiritual birth,
not just a physical birth.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:90%
The idea is the same.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're dead, can
you have a rebirth,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
so you can just be the
light that you are?

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, to me, the
fascinating imperative question

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is, can we do that
when we're alive?

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Can we not wait.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to remember
those spells when I'm dead.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So I want to work on it here,
rather than just leave it

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
a bit to luck when I'm dead.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what does
the afterlife look like?

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, there
isn't just one answer.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The way I perceive it-- and
I've always been really visual,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:90%
from a psychic perspective.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.735 align:middle line:84%
To me, I see it as these
series of planes of light.

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:90%
They're colorful.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:90%
They're different shapes.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There's different aromas to
them-- senses and sounds.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that I can't
perceive them all--

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not capable,
or I'm not able,

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:90%
at least in the physical state.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But I literally see them
like reams and reams

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
of states or realms of light.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
when we die, there's

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
typical processes most
souls go through that

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
are also on a plane of light.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Most people with near-death
experiences, for instance,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
do report.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they rest a
little bit, but then

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:90%
they typically evaluate.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:90%
What did they learn?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Who have they been?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some healing
and there's growth.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:90%
So these are planes of growth.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:90%
There's many of them.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And we tend to--

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I believe when we die--

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
gravitate toward the one
maybe we were on last time,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
or, hopefully, we've
achieved another level

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:90%
while we were alive.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So we get to, kind of,
kick it up a little bit.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle line:90%
But that's how I see them.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They're like worlds
unto themselves.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And, you know,
I always felt that

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.894 align:middle line:84%
in my first depictions
of afterlife--

00:08:05.894 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
frankly, when I was a child,
I would think about it.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And think, OK, what's
the possibilities?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You can die and it's just
blackness, which would be just

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
like a tomb forever and ever.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Horrible.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right?

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.594 align:middle line:90%
If you're conscious, especially.

00:08:17.594 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the idea of
heaven and I thought, well,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.907 align:middle line:90%
what if you get bored?

00:08:20.907 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you have-- is that
what brings people back here?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it almost a
sense of, well, you

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
get to a certain level
of light and then you

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.521 align:middle line:90%
realize, wait, I'm bored.

00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I need to experience
and feel and go

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
through the drama of these
different incarnations.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that what brings us here?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.391 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We're never done.

00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I think boredom is a real issue.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I was
always stuck being

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
an angel in all the school
plays because I have blond hair.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd make me
stand there and sing.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They'd go, well, don't you
want to be practicing what

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.938 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do in heaven?

00:08:44.938 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I ain't
going to heaven

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:90%
if this is what we're doing.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.266 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was horrifying.

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're still
growing and changing.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
lose our identity,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
but we're still
assuming new ideas

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and new ways of being
while we're alive

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and while we're dead.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's an eternal
growth process.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
The Sufi System
talks about that,

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that there's always another
quality to become or to embrace

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
or to learn about.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So we're never done.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you think
you're done, I mean,

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:90%
you just get another assignment.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.755 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And do people end up
incarnating to other worlds,

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:19.555 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I have no doubt about that.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I do a weird
thing for a living--

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.946 align:middle line:84%
I do intuitive work and
healing and whatever--

00:09:27.946 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I get to talk about things
like that, which is great--

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:90%
which is great fun.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I can talk to a group of
accountants and talk about,

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
now some of you may think
you come from another planet.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go,
oh, oh, I remember.

[LAUGHING]

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It's actually fascinating
how people remember

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
where they've been or
how they feel the call

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:90%
that their home is not here.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Their home is somewhere else.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my job when I'm
working with individuals

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is to help them make those
connections, not so they

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
instantly leave here
and go back there--

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
because maybe back there has
evolved and changed, too.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So they can bring that knowledge
forward, make those connections

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
again, bring in the
connections with those beings,

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.065 align:middle line:84%
and be more of who
they are right here.

00:10:10.065 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you mentioned the
different spectrums of light

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.905 align:middle line:90%
and colors--

00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:13.705 align:middle line:90%

00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --in the
afterlife, beyond the veil.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.159 align:middle line:84%
Do these resonate with
the chakra system?

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They absolutely
do, at least in my world.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: OK.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: All right.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You can certainly analyze what
comes next without knowing

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:90%
the chakra system.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm really practical, even
though talking about planes

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of light and chakras don't
necessarily seem that,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:90%
but I work with living people.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.995 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes I work
with dead people, too,

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:90%
to be really honest.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, the chakras
are subtle energy bodies--

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
are gateways into
the planes of light.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:90%
They're like eyes.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
They're like channels
through which

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:90%
we can see what's over there.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
We can gain access to what's
available on a plane of light.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But we can also bring the wisdom
and the knowledge in, as well.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.665 align:middle line:84%
I understand that you can use
chakras to do physical healing.

00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I understand you
can access chakras

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to gain memories
of when you were

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
a little kid or a past life.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think, ultimately,
they're enlightenment vehicles

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we
want to call them,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they're able to
access those planes

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and bring the energy here--

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: --into the self.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Chakra systems bring up this
issue of alchemy in a sense,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
because when we're talking
about spiritual transformation,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the transformation
of our base into gold

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.638 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of basically
moving up the chakras

00:11:28.638 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and, yes, accessing from the
deepest roots to the highest

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:90%
heavens.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
What are the alchemical
aspects of the various metals

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
in our endocrine
glands and basically

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
how they affect our
spiritual growth?

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I find
this a fascinating topic,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
because I actually do believe,
and I have some science

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.996 align:middle line:84%
to support this, not
a lot, but some--

00:11:50.996 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
science has to
catch up, I think,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to what we're perceiving.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
connected to each chakra

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.055 align:middle line:84%
and to each endocrine gland,
connected to its chakra,

00:11:59.055 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
because each chakra is connected
to a different endocrine

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:90%
gland--

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
even the one I work
with underneath the feet

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.241 align:middle line:84%
connects to the bone marrow,
which is about everything.

00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Stem cells--

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
That there are
transitional metals--

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I call them alchemical metals.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Science would call them
transitional metals.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:90%
They're fascinating elements.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
They're fascinating
metals that are actually

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
able to create alchemy
within the physical body.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
There's about 38 transitional
elements or metals,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
according to science.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're unlike other
metals, because the atoms

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
are what they call monoatomic,
meaning they're weird.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:10%
They're unusual.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They have strange things
happening with their orbits.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So as they start
to spin, as an atom

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
starts to spin, say for gold or
cobalt or copper or iron or one

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of these different metals, the
atoms change, they elongate.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
They get what they
call super-deformed.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And they start to spin
even quicker and quicker

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and quicker, until, at the
easiest way to explain it,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
they basically just
disappear into light.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
The actual metallic
component can

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:90%
become liquid and/or powder.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And we found these
powders that are made out

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of spun transitional metals
in the tombs in Egypt.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And they impact gravity.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So things become
more weightless.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the same idea behind
the trains in Japan,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
where you get them--

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%
it's levitation.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Building the pyramids.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's all about
the transitional metals.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So we've been gaining
lost knowledge

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
how to use that in everyday
life to build things,

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to cure cancer, to do
all sorts of things.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
ultimately, in that spin,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
which we can create through
cultivating consciousness

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
through becoming
more pure, becoming

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
more of who we really are.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The transitional metals in the
endocrine glands in the chakras

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
actually open up
gateways to those planes.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You're saying it's only
done through consciousness?

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.999 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It can be food, because
where the lower energy centers

00:14:04.999 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:90%
in the body are the more dense.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%
They're the most physical.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.286 align:middle line:84%
And so we absolutely do
need to pay attention

00:14:10.286 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to what we're eating,
what we're doing,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
how we're talking, how we're
speaking, how we're dealing

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with our emotions, because
each chakra is in charge

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
of a different part
of our beingness,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
not just our spiritual being
but how that spiritual self

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:90%
manifests through the physical.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sorry, you can't just eat
Three Musketeer bars, probably,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and completely ascend.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:33.783 align:middle line:90%
Maybe somebody can.

00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:35.741 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It'll be a sugar
rush, but I don't know

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:90%
if that's going to--

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But I think your models
are going to get a little dull.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, exactly.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So we're here to be
physical and psychological

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.562 align:middle line:84%
as well as kind of open up
to the spiritual dimensions.

00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what
are your tips then,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
for how we can activate
those transitional metals?

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I
think pay attention.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I like learning
about the chakras,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
because if you know the
basics on the chakras,

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
like the one underneath of
feet is about your environment.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Go outside.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Go outside and
think good thoughts.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Go outside.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I run my dogs every
morning at the park.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I figure that's doing the
clay metal that's down there.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.529 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Are you getting
barefoot, though?

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Not in Minnesota.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.861 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: That's the whole point.

00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to ground them.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Hey, the dogs ground me.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Do what the chakra
would have you do.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd say follow the
chakra standards.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So in terms of
the 13 planes of light,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.072 align:middle line:90%
and that would be--

00:15:27.072 --> 00:15:28.155 align:middle line:90%
each one is connected to--

00:15:28.155 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: To a different
chakra in my world.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: We have 13 chakras?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I
believe we have 12.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I work with a 12 chakra system.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Some people work with seven.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:84%
If you really study
it across culture,

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
people say anywhere from
three to 99 chakras.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So pick your system
and work with it.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Mine works well for me and
the clients I work with.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe the 13th plane is sort
of more about consciousness.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not really a chakra.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of an attainment.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.724 align:middle line:90%
It's embracing that clear light.

00:15:55.724 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: A higher self.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.765 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's a higher self.

00:15:57.765 --> 00:16:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Being it in the body
though, is the task.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so there are certain
tips and cues to activate

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and grow and enrich each chakra?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Each, exactly, about
what you do, what you eat.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Is it more psychological?

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you do something
more physical?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there a specific
type of guide

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
you could open with who can
instruct you, et cetera?

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And you mention guides.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.884 align:middle line:90%
Are these ascended masters?

00:16:22.884 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: There is a lot of
different types of guides,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.864 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
ascended masters.

00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: What does that mean?

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Typically, the term
ascended masters means--

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and there's also a term avatar.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it's
referring to a person

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
who became so enlightened when
they were alive they didn't

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
need to really lose their body.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They just sort of they just sort
of became the ascended self.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:90%
They transformed.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Their body sort of transfigured.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:84%
That's typically what
we're talking about.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
There's different
types of guides.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some beings actually
do lose their bodies

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:90%
like Jesus did.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
He had a physical body.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But then it rose
after it was dead.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
you would call him.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different
sort of category altogether.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's guides
that are angels.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
There's different
kinds of angels.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
There's beings that I
call the forms, which

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
represent big ideas that
can help us actually make

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
physical changes
within who we are.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So from my point
of view, there's

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
different types of
guides that specialize

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.789 align:middle line:90%
in the different planes.

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
do any of it perfect.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the other
important thing.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I typically for myself
work through one plane

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.192 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:17:35.192 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the plane of
knowledge, because it's

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
the one I like the best.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.347 align:middle line:84%
So I think we can be
very individualistic.

00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And what are
the other planes?

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: There's many of them.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
We start with rest.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
After that, typically we
evolve into evaluation.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a plane of healing.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a plane of knowledge.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of low
on the totem pole.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Usually, I see after
knowledge comes wisdom then

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:90%
truth then peace.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
After peace, you've got to
move around a little bit.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:90%
So we have momentum.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to have
momentum toward something that

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
means something, so
we call that love.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Then love that doesn't do
anything by itself needs power.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's the next plane.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You put love and power together,
you have the plane of charity.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Then there's mastery, which
is very individualized.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
This is when and
how you become who

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:90%
you are individualistically.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I would say we have
the plane of consciousness,

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:90%
the plane of oneness.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But we might go back and forth
between these, when we're dead

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and when we're alive.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.691 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do you think
that until we've

00:18:38.691 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:84%
reached that point that there's
a soul trap that essentially

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:90%
keeps us here on this Earth?

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Pretty much.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I hate saying that.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's not
a bad thing, though.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
When you read most of the tracts
or I talk to most of my clients

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
or I teach classes,
most people are like,

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:90%
do I have to come back.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.367 align:middle line:90%
Can I just be done?

00:18:58.367 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Let's go to
a different world.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And I think it's
really an honor to be here.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I actually like this form.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I like being alive.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
an amazing place.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I think our attitude is
more what they call karmic,

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
which is that we have to
keep working it through.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we
believe we have

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to keep working it
through, we have

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
to keep working it through.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Once we get that there's a
lot more freedom than that

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and we can actually
enjoy it here,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
we can kind of be
more about love

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.105 align:middle line:90%
than being perfectionistic.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Making it up to everybody what
we done wrong or having them

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:90%
make it up to us.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's ultimately
a very practical way

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to say we could be freed
from coming back here.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But we could choose to come
back here if we want to too.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: In the
process of being here,

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be
a five to seven

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
year death-rebirth cycle
that people are going through

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
constantly, a rejuvenation
of the body and cell process,

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
the shedding of old
skins and that concept.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So what is up with those
numbers, five to seven years?

00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK, I'm a chakra queen.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So the chakras do flip
in terms of their primacy

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:90%
every seven years.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
When we're really, really
small up till about age 14,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.819 align:middle line:84%
we go through the chakras much
quicker while we're developing.

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:18.735 align:middle line:84%
We're physical, we're
emotional, we're mental,

00:20:18.735 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:90%
we're relational, et cetera.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But after we hit
about 14, we tend

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:84%
to base ourselves in
a particular chakra,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:84%
because that seems to
be how long it takes,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
from a physical, psychological,
and spiritual point of view,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to work through the
teachings or the wisdoms

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:90%
of a particular chakra.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.354 align:middle line:84%
And I think the body
follows suit as well.

00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you're
saying that when

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.599 align:middle line:84%
you're in your
first seven years,

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:90%
you're on your base, your root?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, you're really
busy your first seven years,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.587 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:20:47.587 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the
womb, we're actually

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
in the first chakra,
which is really physical.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Before we're born,
we're actually

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
in what I call the 10th, which
is genetic, family of origin,

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:90%
natural, et cetera.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:84%
At about six months
to 2 and 1/2 years,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I think we evolve
into the emotional.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Then about 2 and
1/2 to 4 and 1/2,

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
we tend to be more
in the mental.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.456 align:middle line:84%
4 and 1/2 to 6 and
1/2, we're more

00:21:11.456 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth chakra or the
relational, which makes sense

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
if you think of
what kids are doing.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
They're going to school.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to learn.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:90%
They want to talk.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They want to get to know
other kids and socialize.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
The actual learning is more
6 and 1/2 to 8 and 1/2,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
which is the fifth chakra,
which is communication.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we jump for quite some time
till about age 8 and 1/2 to 14

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
or so into the sixth
chakra, which is vision.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's also self-concept.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
It's how do we compare
ourselves with the world.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing with our inner
image of self and the world?

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:90%
13, 14 is pretty rough.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Nobody likes it.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I wore blue eye shadow.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:90%
That's all I remember.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
remember anything else.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
14 to 21, we jump
into the seventh,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:90%
which is really spiritual.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.832 align:middle line:84%
But we're not helping
kids with this.

00:21:59.832 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's coming of age,
but we're not helping kids.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing--

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: No.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't send them
on initiation quests.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, we don't.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing vision quests.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.583 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: We only let
them have alcohol.

00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:90%
They binge drink.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%
They go war.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:90%
The have to find their own way.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: They start fights.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And we're supposed
to help them find out

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
their individual gifts,
what they're really about,

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and how to help them
fit into the community.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if we
have communities anymore,

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:90%
at some level.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Virtual.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.921 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They are virtual.

00:22:24.921 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What happens after
you get to the seventh by,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.983 align:middle line:84%
let's say, around 21
you get to the seventh.

00:22:28.983 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, a
couple things happen.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Again, we have two tracks.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
We do go back and
do it all again,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
back into the first,
the second, the third.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And I work, again, with
a 12 chakra system.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So I add on simultaneously.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So for me, 21 to 28, I call
it the eighth chakra, which

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:90%
is very mystical, shamanic.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It's when we can open
up some of those powers.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:90%
We may do our karma.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:84%
We may marry the same person
we did 14,000 years ago.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
We repeat a lot from our soul.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And we keep evolving as well.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But you notice it's
really seven-year blocks

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
once we reach that 14.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.249 align:middle line:84%
We just keep going through
our seven-year blocks.

00:23:10.249 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
For different people,
it's different.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
But I think that's the general.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way of bypassing in
a sense or to focus your energy,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:90%
like by doing practices?

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.357 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:23:18.357 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: To get you out
of certain chakras as

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.398 align:middle line:90%
opposed to being stuck there?

00:23:21.398 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely, yes.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
two keys to that.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I would work with
our strong chakras.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm really strong and two
or three different chakras.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:90%
So why not work it?

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Why not elevate myself
through that chakra?

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Why not really let it leave me?

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Why not teach myself with it
and make sure that my practice--

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so for instance, I'm very
first chakra, very physical,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I run a company.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I run my dogs.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I run my kids.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:90%
So I'm good at that.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So I have to
take care of that chakra,

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's also the
most stressed out.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So I eat for my adrenals
which is connected to it.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I always move.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
I always exercise.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I am ADHD, which a lot
of us are, which is fine.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:90%
So you just take care of it.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Is this a new
phenomenon, by the way?

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, of course not.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.865 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What do you
make of it then?

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Is this having to do with our
consciousness and awakening

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and ascension?

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.911 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I do
think there's more

00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and more kids getting
called ADHD, autistic,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:84%
on the spectrum, et cetera,
because some of them

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:90%
are what I call crystal kids.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:90%
They're here to wake us up.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
They're here to say, can we
all get more sensitive now.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Can we break up what we're
doing in the school room?

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back to the
way we're supposed to be?

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of especially Asperger
kids, they're really sensitive.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Their energy fields
are reversed.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not like
all the rest of us.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:90%
They feel things.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.535 align:middle line:90%
They bring things in.

00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:90%
They can teach us.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:90%
They're brilliant.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So we need to learn from this.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we need
kids not stressed out.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I love they have--
some of these schools

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.539 align:middle line:84%
are introducing
elliptical machines.

00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And people are literally
doing elliptical

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.834 align:middle line:84%
while they're at their
desks so they don't have

00:24:54.834 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:90%
to sit there and be fidgety.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.085 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:24:56.085 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And it's
better for the system.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: My youngest son, ADHD.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I had to teach him everything.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
We go play basketball.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I took him to Disney when I was
teaching him the multiplication

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:90%
tables.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was happy to learn
them when we were walking around

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.817 align:middle line:90%
with Mickey.

00:25:09.817 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: I feel that.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I sense that it's almost
because of the nature of how

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
we're absorbing and
thinking and learning.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:15.725 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I'm able to be on my
phone, have a conversation,

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
absorb some
information over there,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and not have to
just sit there and--

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:90%
I can read stuff.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have to
sit there and read.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%
My mind is working more quickly.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And we're elevating.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:90%
We're growing.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And the kids coming in--

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.745 align:middle line:84%
I'd say anybody up till
like, whatever, 40, 45--

00:25:34.745 --> 00:25:35.620 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
There's just like some
elevated abilities.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm over that.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in that
generation that has

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
to make room and
make way and go look,

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:90%
we've got to change the system.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to make this OK
stuff not not-OK stuff.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
We've got to make room for
it, because they're all gifts.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:90%
They're all abilities.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.257 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And how can we actively
approach these planes of light?

00:25:57.257 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously the
near-death experience.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.464 align:middle line:84%
There's the
afterlife experience.

00:26:00.464 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But in life itself,
how do we get there?

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I would say
you can Google chakras.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Pick one and start with it.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a million
sites out there

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that are going to say each
chakra's about x, y, z.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Pick a focus, and go for it.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like
you'd really learn

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
how to be more yourself
by concentrating

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:84%
on the fifth chakra, which
is about communication.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't just make
it boring, though.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Eat for it.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Cultivate it.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to
what you're thinking.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Think about if you want
to be thinking that.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Ask what you're hearing.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Are there different kinds of
messages you want to bring in?

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say, pick
one and focus on it.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.024 align:middle line:84%
If you can connect them to a
plane of light, all the better,

00:26:41.024 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
because then you've got
more guides helping you out.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You can walk around
with the stones that

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.435 align:middle line:90%
are affiliated with a plane.

00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd say make it simple,
because if you really

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
get one thing down, other
things fall into place.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Got you.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
journey after life

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
book and the overall concept,
how is it helping us as people

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to prepare for the afterlife?

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Change now.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave it till then.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to know all
the spells the Egyptians were

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.777 align:middle line:90%
We don't read the book anymore.

00:27:10.777 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You don't think
they're relevant any more?

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think
they probably are.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
That would be a whole other
book, how to cast them now.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And they actually did start
to write individual books

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of the dead for the living.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They wrote them
up for the people

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
who were alive to tell
them what to do now.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I'd say just transform now.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy who you are right now.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Really concentrate
on what meaning

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing to
the world and what

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
the world is bringing to
you in a meaningful way

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:90%
on a day to day basis.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'd say just start now.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And what about the
relationship to the creator

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and to angels?

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Are these experienced
in the afterlife,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:90%
experienced with people?

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They're in the
afterlife, they are.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
They're in this life.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I think we're so
blocked off to that,

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
because if it makes television,
it's just like a Bruce Willis

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:90%
film or something.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that neat?

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It's growing, even kids.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I have young kids coming to me.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And after they stumble
around, I say, OK,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.910 align:middle line:84%
so tell me why you're really
talking to someone like me.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I had one little kid come in.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because
I see aliens.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
They come to me to me.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw them in the
movies the other day.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.120 align:middle line:84%
She sat next to me while
I watched the movie.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:90%
So of course there's beings.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Of course there's connections.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Of course we can make them.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And why not?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
If there is a veil,
it's only because we

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.997 align:middle line:90%
think there's a veil.

00:28:34.997 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So that veil
is lifting potentially?

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.746 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is lifting.

00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I think it has to.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:90%
And I think it is, yeah.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:10%
There's even studies that
ancient people worked

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:10%
with what they call
an analog rather than

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:10%
a digital way of knowing.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:10%
We've been digital,
which is step by step

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:10%
and really logical.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But our deeper
neurology is what they

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
call analog, which
is whole, which

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is there's no separate between
the body and the environment.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no separate between
creator and our soul.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all unified.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:90%
That's our deeper self.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:10%
That's really what
we're trying to go back

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:10%
to is to live from that place.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.465 align:middle line:10%

Thank you so much

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:90%

It's been my pleasure.
