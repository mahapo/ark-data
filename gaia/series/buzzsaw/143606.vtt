00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE: Sinister forces
and political witchcraft.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.919 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.386 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:18.885 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.607 align:middle line:10%
And with me today
is Peter Levenda,

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:10%
who has been
investigating and writing

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
about the connections
that exists

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
between politics, religion,
and history since the 1970s.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:84%
He's written many books,
such as "Sinister Forces,"

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
a grimoire of American
political witchcraft.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:10%
His novel, "The Lovecraft Code,"
published in December, 2016,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:10%
and the first installment
of his three volume work

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:10%
for Tom DeLonge, called
"Secret Machines--

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Gods, Man, and War,"
published in March, 2017.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Today he joins me to talk
about our haunted planet.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.239 align:middle line:84%
Really, where I want
to start is this issue

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of what John Keel has called
the "haunted planet," because it

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
seems to me that you do have a
certain sensibility that there

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
is much more going on
here than meets the eye.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to start
by asking, is this

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
a belief that you've
always had since childhood?

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have some
direct experience,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
whether it was out of
body, or extraterrestrial,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
or supernatural, at some
point in your early life?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.285 align:middle line:84%
>>PETER LEVENDA:
In a sense, yes.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:10%
I've never seen a
UFO, for instance.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:10%
So that whole aspect
is not something

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:10%
that I have direct
experience of.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But as far as
supernatural experiences,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
or anything sort of paranormal,
I did, when I was much younger.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of drawn
to the subject matter

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:90%
at a pretty early age.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Brought up Catholic, there
was a lot of mysticism.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.329 align:middle line:84%
A lot of talk about angels
and demons, and, you know,

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
heaven and hell, and
all of these concepts.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:10%
So you grew up, you know,
surrounded by the supernatural

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:10%
in that sense.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:90%
But then, considerably later--

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I was about 15 or 16 years old--

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and I had an experience of
the table-tipping variety.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So there were a seance
conducted by members

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:90%
of my own immediate family.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And a very large,
very heavy oaken

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
table we had gotten
in New Hampshire, when

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
we lived there briefly.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:10%
And just fooling
around, basically,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:10%
with a Ouija board
and some candles,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:10%
we decided to see
what would happen.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And we had that experience.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:10%
So we had this experience of
a table rising in the air.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's was a problem
for me, in a sense.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.784 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know
how to handle that.

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Ouija board
thing and everything--

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
you can sort of explain
away a lot of things.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
But I was in high school.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get my high
school diploma and graduate.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking
courses in chemistry,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and physics, and
all the sciences,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and here I am watching
something which

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
defies any kind of
scientific explanation.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So I basically kept my mouth
shut where that was concerned,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and didn't talk about
this to anyone else,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:90%
because it was just too strange.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And it would not
have done well for me

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:90%
to go around talking about this.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And let's face it, most people
would not believe it anyway.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
So I kept it to myself.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I kept my whole
experience of that quiet.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But what it did do in a
positive way was open my mind

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that there are
things that happen-- now,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.615 align:middle line:84%
whether they're physical
forces, or supernatural forces--

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
you know, I don't know.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an easy
explanation for it.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
things do take place.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes under human control.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And these things can take
place, they can occur,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and now you have to
somehow integrate this

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:90%
into your view of reality.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's the hard part.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, I look
back on that one episode

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in a negative way, because
if that hadn't happened,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.135 align:middle line:84%
my life might have gone on
in a more rational, you know,

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.922 align:middle line:90%
in a more normal way.

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:42.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Or boring.

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Or boring.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: A more boring way.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: For sure.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And I think it's
very similar to experiences

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
that I've had.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
point is that you

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
didn't fall into the trap of
only studying the supernatural.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
You actually said,
look, I'm an historian.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.984 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to study history.

00:03:55.984 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many
wonderful anecdotal accounts,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
historically, of many
things like this.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So this only helped inform
your historical study.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:10%
Then so in terms of this
new book with Tom DeLonge--

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:10%
obviously he is a rock
star from Blink 182,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:10%
but he also has his own
perception and belief

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
in aliens and the supernatural.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He came out and made
waves talking about this

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.304 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago, I believe.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:10%
About two years ago.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So what did Tom bring
to the conversation that

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
made you want to work with
him on the "Secret Machines"

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.756 align:middle line:90%
project?

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: That's an
interesting story,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
because I had heard of Tom
DeLonge, of course, before.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.322 align:middle line:90%
I heard of Blink 182.

00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he contacted
me, I thought

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
it was some kind
of hoax, initially.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But eventually we
worked that part out.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And we had some very long
conversations on this.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And his approach to this
was quite interesting.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to do a multimedia
multi-disciplinary approach

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
to the subject.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
He had always been fascinated
by the UFO phenomenon.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And he felt that a
lot of the work that's

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:10%
been done so far, while
it has been very valuable

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:10%
and it's built up
a lot of evidence,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:10%
and mountains of evidence
for the existence

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:10%
of the phenomenon, as we call
it, was not getting anywhere.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:10%
We're sort of in a loop on this.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:10%
And we keep looking
for disclosure.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We keep looking for
somebody in authority

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to come down and tell
us, yes, it's all right.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
You can believe in UFOs now.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
His approach was,
let's create something

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:90%
which is much more powerful.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the
information that we know.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's not try to prove
the existence of UFOs,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:90%
because that's been done.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:10%
If you already have
read all of these books

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:10%
by all the famous
authors on UFOs,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:10%
whether they're good,
bad, or indifferent,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.229 align:middle line:10%
you already have an
opinion about this.

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
There's no need for us
to go back and start

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.603 align:middle line:84%
writing all these
books that are going

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to prove the existence
of UFOs, and go

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
into all these lengthy
sighting analysis.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
That's just boring,
and it's been

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:90%
done before by a lot of people.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
getting us anywhere.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always tell people
who talk to me about this,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.552 align:middle line:90%
how's that working out for you?

00:05:56.552 --> 00:05:57.351 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:05:57.351 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We are in a loop on this, and
we're not getting anywhere.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So what Tom was expressing was,
let's start from the premise

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:90%
that this is a real phenomenon.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from there?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, how do we integrate
people from the sciences?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:90%
From the government?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:90%
From military?

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:10%
From the intelligence
operations?

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.074 align:middle line:84%
From corporate and
industrial areas?

00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we get these
people to talk

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to us about what they know?

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The aspect of this
phenomenon they've seen.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Or how they interpret
the phenomenon,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
if they haven't
directly experienced it.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:90%
What do we do about that?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:90%
How do we approach this?

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to
let people know

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
reality behind this,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and that it actually has
impacted human society

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time?

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If we accept the phenomenon
exists and it's real,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
it means that we
go back to history

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and look at it with fresh eyes.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a religious
or cult-like approach

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're taking.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It's probably the opposite.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We think that an
atheist, or a skeptic,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
should be comfortable with
this analysis of history.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it kind of removes
a lot of the mysticism

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
from the explanation,
in a sense.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the ideology, a lot of
the spirituality, in a sense.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And brings it down to,
there was contact between us

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
and some other entity.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Some other phenomenon.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what jump
started everything.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But DeLonge also has
talked about his relationship

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
with certain
government insiders.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Yes.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And the desire
to basically perpetuate

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
disclosure.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so can you tell us
anything about his accounts,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.964 align:middle line:84%
his information
that he's discussed,

00:07:34.964 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
or what makes you believe that,
yes, he has these sources,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.349 align:middle line:84%
and they really do want to
disclose what's taking place?

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: In the first
place, I know the sources

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
exist for a number of reasons.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:84%
One, because I've been involved
peripherally, or sometimes

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
directly, in some of
these conversations.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So I can vouch for the fact that
these sources actually exist.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, because
of the WikiLeaks leak

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of John Podesta's
e-mails, we have

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
the names of some of the
people we've talked to.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They were released
against our will.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Not because we wanted that.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
We were protecting our
sources, and we take that

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:90%
very seriously.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, there
was this illegal operation,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and the names of
people were released.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.669 align:middle line:84%
So the world now knows that
Tom was not making this up.

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Those are not the names of the
advisors, or all the advisers,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you an idea
of who we were talking to.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking to
people who were very highly

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:90%
advanced in the military.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
And in various aspects
of the space exploration

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
mechanism of the United States.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.591 align:middle line:90%
So that much is true.

00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
What they've been
telling us is something

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that we've been keeping
close to our vest,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
One, because we have to be
careful about what we say,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that if we say something,
it doesn't reveal a source.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to how
do we talk about this,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and can we get corroboration
from more people?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Either people who are willing
to go on the record, or even

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
people who are not, but
multiple sources to corroborate.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:90%
So we work along those lines.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:90%
We want to protect the sources.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.805 align:middle line:84%
That's, of course,
very important to us.

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to the sources.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, as you can imagine.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, what we want to do is
make sure the information

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.004 align:middle line:84%
we're giving makes
sense to our audience--

00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to our proposed
audience, which is

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
people who may never have
come to this subject at all

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
if it was not for Tom DeLonge
and his celebrity status.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
That way, people who know
Tom and like the music

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
are willing to kind of
entertain this information.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Entertain this idea that
there is a reality to the UFO

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're interested in
approaching these people

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and saying, this
is why, you know,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
we're going in this direction.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
trying to accomplish.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we're bringing
the information--

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in the first book, for instance,
I make a direct reference

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:90%
to the advisers.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And they told us, in
one particular case,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
to go back and relook at
stories of the Greek myths.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.502 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Greek
mythology in general.

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Without going into
too much detail,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
they directed us-- they
sent us in that direction,

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and said, look at this again,
from your perspective now.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is what helped to
inform book one of "The Secret

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Machines--

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.826 align:middle line:90%
Gods, Man, and War" project.

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Was, we looked
back at this thing

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and we said, oh, I see
what you're saying.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I see where you're
going with this.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If we reanalyze the Greek
mythology in terms of contact,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
certain things
start to make sense

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
that didn't make sense before.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of our project.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We start the book off
talking about cargo cults.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Now cargo cults is a common
kind of a meme, you might say.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
People are familiar
with the idea.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
People in a very
primitive location.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
A Stone Age people suddenly see
airplanes landing on a landing

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
strip, and they're bringing
food, and medicine,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and uniforms, and technology,
and these Stone Age people

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.512 align:middle line:90%
are watching this take place.

00:10:57.512 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what this is.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
They have no context for it in
their society, their religion,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:90%
their culture-- nothing.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Just the mere experience
of this changes them.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.504 align:middle line:84%
So they go and they build
airline landing strips, right?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
They build conning towers--
they build all kinds of stuff.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
They take coconuts and
build headsets from it.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
duplicate what they saw,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
in the expectation
that a plane will

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
land on their landing strip, and
give them all this good stuff.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: OK?

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
cargo cult concept.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We've taken this
one step further.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying, it's not
just our religion that's

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
a cargo cult. It's not
just the pyramids in Egypt,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:90%
or the Nazca Lines or something.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We're saying our entire
civilization is a cargo

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
cult. Our science
is a cargo cult.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we're trying
to get off planet.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to go to the stars.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to go to space.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
When, for hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
we wandered around the
savannas of this planet.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We were perfectly OK as
Homo sapiens doing nothing

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.132 align:middle line:84%
much except hanging
out and chilling.

00:12:03.132 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
something happens

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and we all get crazy, all around
the globe at the same time,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and we are now trying
to get to the stars.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So do you think
that the Masons are

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
an extension of those ancient
builder cults around, you know,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.361 align:middle line:84%
things like the pyramids
and the ziggurats?

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Basically, are you saying that,
you know, if that were true,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
did the Masons basically take
us back to our ET origins,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.166 align:middle line:90%
in a sense?

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: In a sense, yes.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've written
about this a little bit

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:10%
in a book called
"Tantric Temples."

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And I also wrote a
book on Freemasonry

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:10%
called "The Secret Temple."

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the interesting
part of Freemasonry

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
was their connections back
to the ancient builders.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:10%
The idea of geometry,
and mathematics--

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:10%
and even going so far
as to introduce music

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:10%
as a kind of geometry
in mathematics as well.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
This idea that the
whole human experience

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
is based upon some chords,
you know, and some harmonics.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
The Builders understood that.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, they integrated
the earthly topography

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:90%
with the celestial one.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
That was very important.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:90%
The alignment of buildings.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Even if it was just purely on
cardinal-- cardinal points.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
North, East, South, and West.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
There was this idea that
the planet and the cosmos

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
itself was connected
in some way.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And the connection
was to be found

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics and geometry.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning,
I think, of understanding

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:84%
how to create this
kind of mystique

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:84%
where we're going
to go off planet.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.145 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Masons,
before the 18th century--

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
the Masons who were
actually conducting

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies in the 15th
century, for instance.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:90%
In the 16th century--

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
were really focused on the
idea of, number one, building,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and geometry on the one hand.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time with
initiation on the other.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
With death and rebirth.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And death and rebirth rituals
go back at least as far

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
as ancient Egypt.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid structures
were designed

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
as one pyramidologist
called it, the pyramid

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:90%
is a resurrection machine.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that you
can create a device

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that would send
someone to the stars--

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:90%
to live an immortal existence--

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.040 align:middle line:90%
was ancient.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.623 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the
very heart of what

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
it means to be human in our
civilizations around the world.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:90%
The idea of immortality.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think connecting
immortality

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
with geometry,
and with building,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and with music-- creating
these devices, these machines?

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:90%
The Gothic cathedrals?

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of us
think of Freemasons

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
as a bunch of guys
meeting up, you know,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and dressing in funny
robes, and, you know,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
memorizing long,
incomprehensible speeches,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and then having business
discussions later, right?

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
In small towns across the United
States and around the world.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
aspect to Freemasonry,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.570 align:middle line:90%
which is the initiatory one.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The third degree ritual
is a beautiful ritual

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%
of death and rebirth.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
been duplicated by cultures

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is
where our focus is.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:90%
What is death and rebirth?

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
What is immortality?

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is the
secret of human existence?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
All these things go
back to these issues.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the only way,
sometimes, to understand

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
what these issues are is to
experience them directly.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.059 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the initiation
process enables you to do.

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So would you
say that we have a lot

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:90%
to learn from ancient Egypt?

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be-- we
should take pantheism

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.166 align:middle line:90%
from it, or even alchemy.

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously I know you're
very fascinated by alchemy.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
You've written a number
of books on the subject.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So you think that these are
important for our society,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: I think
that ancient Egypt is.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We know so little
about it, really.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We're uncovering more and more
information as we go along.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The country is
full of monuments,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and stelae, and things
we haven't seen yet--

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:90%
we're uncovering day by day.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that, for
me, the interest

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
was always in one specific
ritual, believe it or not.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Out of all the rituals
of ancient Egypt,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
only one really fascinates
me, and that's the Opening

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Mouth Ceremony.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's the mummy process.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
During the
mummification process,

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.762 align:middle line:90%
an actual device is used.

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
interesting looking thing,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
because it makes
no sense, if you

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:84%
look at it within the context
of Egyptian culture in general.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an oddly shaped
iron device which

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is used to open the mouth of
the mummy, which is basically

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
used to animate the mummy
as it's going on its trip

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
to the stars.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
The device is shaped exactly in
the pattern of the Big Dipper.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
the "Thigh of Set."

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.396 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes in
the hieroglyphics,

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and in some of the Book of
the Dead paintings that you'll

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
find, you'll find an
actual thigh of a bull used

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:90%
as part of the ceremony.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
But also, this adze, as
they call it in English--

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:84%
A-D-Z-E, "adze"-- is
fashioned in this form.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
Great Bear constellation

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
rotates around the North Star.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:90%
The Pole Star.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it never sets-- it
never rises or sets.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
It circles on top.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go below the
horizon, or above it.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It just stays in one
place, and goes around

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:90%
roughly 24 hours a day.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
You can actually tell time
by this constellation.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
there are seven major stars

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
of the Big Dipper.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, was the
basis of our mystification

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:90%
about the number seven.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It was not seven planets.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the ancients were
as innocent or naive to think

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
that the sun and the moon
were the same as the five

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:90%
other planets that they saw.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
smarter than that.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I think the seven refers
to those seven stars,

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
because they are
seven steps that

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:90%
lead you to the final throne--

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the throne of immortality,
the throne of God--

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and this is reprised in some of
the ancient Jewish ceremonies.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:10%
The Merkaba,
mysticism, Hekhalot,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:10%
which is to go on a
journey of seven stages,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and then reach the
throne of God at the end.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find the names of
the stars used by the Arabs,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and used by some of the ancient
cultures, reflect this idea.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.396 align:middle line:84%
This is a vehicle,
these seven stars.

00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Charles
Wayne" in England.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's an actual cart
that's pulled by a horse.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:90%
The Arabs have a similar idea.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It's called a chariot
in some cultures.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:90%
In China, it's called a chariot.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So in cultures all
around the world,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:90%
they see this as a vehicle.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And that, to me, is fascinating.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's the design
of the vehicle.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's made out of meteoric
iron, which was probably

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:84%
magnetized ore, which would
then have pointed north anyway.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: And so they used this
to actually animate the mummy--

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
the spirit contained
within the mummy--

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.905 align:middle line:84%
and so that it can then proceed
on its way to the stars.

00:18:29.905 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So that, to me, is-- there's
a whole world of information

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.056 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And aside
from the number seven,

00:18:35.056 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
the number nine obviously was
prominent within Osirian Egypt,

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
because there were the
Ennead of nine gods.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you say this channeling
session of the nine

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:90%
in the 1950s, right?

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It was led by a CIA
agent, Andrija Puharich.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:52.196 align:middle line:84%
And apparently they were
channeling the nine.

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you make
of that session?

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.474 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important
in your book?

00:18:55.474 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Your first "Sinister Forces"
volume was called "The Nine."

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Why is this session
so important to you?

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: To me, it's
an astonishing event

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't even begin to
describe how important this

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
has to be, and it's largely
ignored, even though everyone's

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:90%
written about it.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Puharich himself
wrote about it in some detail.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Elements of this came
out in various places.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
People acknowledge
that it existed.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows that
this actually happened,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:90%
and yet nobody cares.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I
can't believe it.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:10%
Here, in this
particular seance, you

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:10%
had not only Andrija
Puharich, who at the time

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:10%
had a commission in the US Army.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:10%
Was going back to the army
during the Korean War.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Was giving speeches on
weaponizing the paranormal,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:90%
you know, at Edgewood Arsenal.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here was a
guy who was considered

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.714 align:middle line:84%
OK by the military industrial
establishment, right?

00:19:46.714 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So he's going on and
talking about this,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
but he's having a seance
in the woods in Maine.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And participating in
this seance is a DuPont--

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:90%
a member of the DuPont family.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:90%
A member of the Astor family.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:10%
Arthur Young, who invented
the Bell Helicopter,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:10%
and his wife, Ruth Forbes.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:10%
These people are all
part of the seance.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:10%
This is the blue blood American
dynasties who are present

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:10%
at this particular
seance, trying

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:10%
to contact
extraterrestrial beings,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:10%
or some kind of spiritual force,
later described as nine beings

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.636 align:middle line:10%
above a spacecraft
in low earth orbit.

00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:24.436 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:24.436 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at this
and thinking, well,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:90%
this is incredible.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is Arthur
Young and Ruth Forbes--

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
where have I heard that
name before, you know?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So Ruth Forbes was Ruth
Forbes Paine Young.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.909 align:middle line:90%
She had been multiply married.

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And always married to
people who were very,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, prominent in
their fields, and wealthy.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.979 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she
was the Forbes family.

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:90%
That goes without saying.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.561 align:middle line:84%
So we had a Forbes, a DuPont,
an Astor, et cetera, et cetera,

00:20:48.561 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And they're all there.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And Ruth Forbes, of course,
was the mother-in-law

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:10%
of Ruth Paine.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:10%
And Ruth Paine lived
in Texas, and was

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:10%
a friend of Marina Oswald
and Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.290 align:middle line:10%
It was Ruth Paine who got Lee
his job at the Texas School

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:10%
Book Depository.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And her mother-in-law was
at this seance in 1952, '53,

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're conducting
these rituals,

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, and they're
contacting spiritual forces.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the speeches
from the beings--

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.541 align:middle line:84%
"We are nine, and
you are nine"--

00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:84%
because there were nine
participants-- you know,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.085 align:middle line:84%
basically, go out
and do likewise.

00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, go out and do
things, and, you know,

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:90%
change the world.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And a very interesting
sentence was

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
given that peace is not
necessarily the absence of war.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was kind
of a chilling statement.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.889 align:middle line:84%
And it was never really
explained more than that.

00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Can we have war and
still have peace?

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
How are we interpreting
peace, you know?

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
happening in 1953.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.259 align:middle line:84%
The first seance was
in '52, New Year's Eve,

00:21:56.259 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and then the actual seance
with all the people involved

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
was in 1953.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The UFO overflights
of Washington, DC,

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
had occurred in 1952.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.999 align:middle line:90%
In July of '52.

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this had any
effect on what people were

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.072 align:middle line:90%
thinking at that seance or not.

00:22:11.072 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
There might have
been a connection.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was,
Ruth Forbes Paine Young

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
was the best friend
of Mary Bancroft.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:10%
Mary Bancroft was the
mistress of Allen Dulles,

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:10%
the head of the CIA.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:30.342 align:middle line:10%
During the Warren Commission
examinations, and the testimony

00:22:30.342 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:10%
and the interviews
that were given,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.250 align:middle line:10%
Ruth Paine is being
interviewed by the panel

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:10%
about what she knew about
Lee Harvey Oswald, and Marina

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:10%
Oswald.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The story she wanted
to learn Russian,

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.957 align:middle line:84%
and all this other
stuff that was going on.

00:22:41.957 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she ever
learned Russian, quite frankly.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.248 align:middle line:84%
But she had Marina living
with her for a while.

00:22:46.248 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Lee, on and off.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was Ruth Paine who
basically gave the show away

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.574 align:middle line:84%
to the cops, as far as
the rifle was concerned,

00:22:52.574 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and the photographs,
and all that stuff.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But she's the one who put
him in the Texas School Book

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Depository.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Her mother-in-law, as I
said, was Ruth Forbes.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
She went to visit
Arthur Young and Ruth

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Forbes a couple of months
before the assassination.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:10%
So she had already known
Marina and Lee very well.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.430 align:middle line:10%
She had a Russian defector--

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:10%
a US Marine who had
defected to the Soviet Union

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and come back with
a Russian wife, who

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:10%
was the niece of a military
intelligence Colonel--

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:10%
living in her house.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I think this was discussed.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
When she went up and talked to
Arthur Young and Ruth and all

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:90%
the other people.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.885 align:middle line:10%
And then she comes back down,
and then a couple of months

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:10%
later, bang-- the assassination.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:10%
She's now giving testimony
through the Warren Commission,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:10%
and she starts to
talk about that trip.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.897 align:middle line:84%
She's going into
details about going up--

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was in
August and September--

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:84%
to visit the Youngs
in Philadelphia.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And Allen Dulles is there.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
He changes the
subject immediately.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
He jumps on this, and
starts making jokes--

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:90%
excuse me-- about taxes.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
About something irrelevant.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.839 align:middle line:84%
And the whole conversation
gets derailed.

00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.964 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't figure out why.

00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:02.963 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But you're saying
you think that there's

00:24:02.963 --> 00:24:04.926 align:middle line:84%
a connection also
between the nine

00:24:04.926 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and the assassination
of Kennedy.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Not just because
of the personnel

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:90%
that are around Oswald.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But you think there's an
actual motivational connection.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.255 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: Well,
there is a connection.

00:24:14.255 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:90%
You see, the problem is--

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we're trying
to also explore in the "Secret

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Machines" project--

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the connections are
not what you think they are,

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:90%
or they should be.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're looking
at a conspiracy angle.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.361 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
Arthur Young, and Ruth--

00:24:28.361 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and his wife, Ruth Forbes--
and all these people

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
were involved in a conspiracy
to kill the President?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Not the way we understand it.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why my book is
called "Sinister Forces."

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
There's another level
of understanding history

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and the connections
between things, which I

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:90%
call a quantum view of history.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.682 align:middle line:84%
Was the Kennedy assassination
a particle or a wave?

00:24:47.682 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, it depends upon
how you're looking at this,

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to
bring to the table.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And what evidence
there is there.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of it,
of course, is gone.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So what you're looking at is
the silhouette of something.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.089 align:middle line:90%
A dark and sinister force.

00:25:01.089 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's oftentimes
the synchronicities

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:90%
that are more prominent.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the real science
of the universe.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:90%
The synchronicity.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, as humans,
it's so difficult for us

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:90%
to discern what's taking place.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Yes.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Anecdotally, I
know someone, actually,

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:84%
who told me that he
had heard from one

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of Kennedy's mistresses that
the only thing Kennedy feared

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:90%
was the nine.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And my friend told me this.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I had no idea
what she was talking about.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.015 align:middle line:84%
I thought she meant the
nine Supreme Court justices.

00:25:25.015 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Right.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And I see your book.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm, like, what is going on?

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.489 align:middle line:84%
What is synchronicity
really about?

00:25:31.489 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
day, do you believe

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.805 align:middle line:84%
that there are spell books,
grimoires, there are things,

00:25:35.805 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, things that basically
are channeling these, you know,

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
another dimension of reality
that is ultimately influencing

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
our world leaders,
in terms of how

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
they decide to create, you know,
our policy, which is oftentimes

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
war, which, you
know, fuels these,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, a debt-based
system, right, of economics,

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and the pyramid of power.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.345 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
there is this, you know,

00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:84%
is this other level
above our leaders

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that they basically
consult with, or look to,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.054 align:middle line:90%
in terms-- in guiding them?

00:26:05.054 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: It's an
interesting question.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as
a person who works

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:90%
a lot with source material--

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
documents, interviews,
and things like that--

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to pinpoint something
like this definitively,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and say this is
what's happening.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:84%
You can have an
instinctual understanding

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.156 align:middle line:84%
of maybe something
like this is going on.

00:26:22.156 --> 00:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But to answer the first
part of your question

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
first, because that leads
us into this, of course

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
the grimoires, the
workbooks in all cultures

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.620 align:middle line:90%
contain techniques.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:90%
They contain a technology.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%
An actual technology.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
To me, my interest
in religion is not

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.830 align:middle line:84%
in the ideologies of
religion, and the theologies.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.422 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's
misdirection, basically.

00:26:45.422 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really give
me the information

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:90%
that I need to know.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Religion as an ethical
practice is one thing

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.231 align:middle line:84%
that obviously, for some reason,
doesn't interest me at all.

00:26:54.231 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because I was
brought up a Catholic.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, I
believe that religion is

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%
the exoskeleton of mysticism.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It's what is shown
to the people.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It kind of puts it in a coherent
way, and including the rituals,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.086 align:middle line:84%
For instance, for a Catholic,
the ritual of the Mass

00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%
is an extremely bizarre ritual.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was after Vatican II
that I sort of parted ways

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:84%
with the Catholic Church,
because the English Mass,

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.477 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, the chasubles
with the smiling faces

00:27:23.477 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and the guitars ruined the
whole thing for me, you know.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the
mystical experience,

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
which the Mass initially had.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:10%
So you had, you know, the
death and Resurrection,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.334 align:middle line:10%
like we mentioned before
about Freemasonry.

00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Here's the death
and Resurrection.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an initiation ceremony.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're all partaking of
this ceremony in the Mass.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
This is extremely
powerful stuff.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So behind the ritual,
and behind the theology,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and behind the
organization, there

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is a core of a
technology which was

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:84%
used to contact these forces
that we're talking about.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
These forces of
synchronicity, let's say.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Of the coincidences that
run through history.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You can essentially
contact them.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.952 align:middle line:90%
Make contact in some way.

00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote
"Sinister Forces,"

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I was always very
conscious of the fact

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that all these people I was
talking about had tried,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
one way or another, to
make this kind of contact.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Or had the contact
thrust upon them.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:90%
For instance, Guy Banister.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:10%
You know.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:10%
Being sent as an
FBI agent in 1947

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:10%
to investigate the UFO sightings
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:10%
And reporting directly
to J. Edgar Hoover.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:10%
You know, here's somebody
who's talking to UFO witnesses.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:10%
Experiencers.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:10%
Himself.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, suddenly, there's a
passage of almost 20 years.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's 1963, and there's
the assassination.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:84%
There's Guy Banister in
New Orleans punching out

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Jack Martin.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.287 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:28:43.287 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because of the stuff that
was going on with Oswald

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in New Orleans.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Here was somebody who was
exposed to the UFO experience

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.630 align:middle line:90%
In a direct way.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Under orders directly by Hoover.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:90%
By J. Edgar Hoover.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's sending back telexes
back to Hoover that are marked,

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:90%
you know, Subject X--

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, the actual X Files,
and he's reporting on this back

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:90%
to Hoover.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.822 align:middle line:84%
And then the passage of time,
and he's SAC in Chicago,

00:29:09.822 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and then he retires and
he goes to New Orleans,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.940 align:middle line:90%
sets up his own thing.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
He's running guns to the
Cubans, doing whatever else--

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
the guy became kind
of deranged, right?

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Something happened from this
nice, normal FBI agent, who's

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
photograph you can sometimes
find with his class--

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:84%
his graduating class with the
FBI, this very nice, normal guy

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
suddenly becomes this
maniac, you know,

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.512 align:middle line:84%
who's suspected, actually,
of killing the president.

00:29:32.512 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Or part of
that conspiracy.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.511 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: Or part
of the conspiracy.

00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, people make this
contact for good or for ill.

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.446 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
contact can be dangerous.

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
an experience,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
you don't know how
to understand it.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how to express
it, how to take it on board,

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and now it starts to
color your entire reality.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's possibly
what happened

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
with people like Guy
Banister, or other people who

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:90%
made this contact.

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, the Arthur
Young people, and, you know,

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.229 align:middle line:90%
Andrija Puharich for sure.

00:29:59.229 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, I have to
circle back, because of--

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.686 align:middle line:84%
you meant, obviously,
Tom DeLonge,

00:30:02.686 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and these military
and other insiders

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:90%
contacts that you've made.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And you are someone who talks
about secret space program.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea that, basically, the
US already has a fleet in space,

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:84%
based on your conversations
with insiders.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that we
already are in space?

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
That we have this
other dimension

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.297 align:middle line:84%
of our military
industrial complex

00:30:20.297 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and our spiritual
complex that already

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.419 align:middle line:90%
is aware of the alien presence?

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: OK, I'll have to
answer that very carefully.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, essentially,
number one, they

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.625 align:middle line:90%
know more than they're telling.

00:30:33.625 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:90%
In general terms.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:90%
To the general public.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.041 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are holding
back some information.

00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason they're
holding it back is not always

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:84%
for the reasons we
suspect-- political reasons,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.942 align:middle line:84%
or military reasons--
there's enough of that.

00:30:44.942 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
military reasons,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:90%
you know, to keep secrecy.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Especially the Cold War was
a time of tremendous secrecy.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what was going on.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And that was for a reason.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a struggle between
these two superpowers.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:84%
But now, I think that there
is another aspect to this.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And the people that we've spoken
to in general terms, I can say,

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
without being too
specific, have talked

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:84%
about the spiritual
aspect of the phenomenon.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Of the UFO phenomenon.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
everybody, for the most part,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
seems to agree is part
of the experience.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
There is a spirituality,
let's say, to the phenomenon.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's
making everybody,

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
I think, from my perspective,
a little nervous.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not, as a
society in this country,

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:84%
really set up to handle
this in a positive way.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I've written in "Sinister
Forces" about shamanism.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
The shaman goes
through an initiation,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
which is talking about
Siberian shamanism.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:90%
The real thing.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They go through an experience
which is horrendous.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
They experience their
bodies being torn apart.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:84%
They experience their bowels
being removed and reinserted.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They experience death
in all kinds of ways,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:90%
as part of their initiation--

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:90%
alone, in the forest.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And when all of this is over
with, they come back, reborn.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a mechanism
for that in this country.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So when people start to
undergo processes like that,

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we either put them away, or in
some cases, as I've written,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe that in some cases
serial killers are shamans

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:90%
who have not made it back.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
They're externalizing
what should be

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.180 align:middle line:90%
an internal spiritual process.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And they are constantly
acting out the same ritual

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.486 align:middle line:84%
over and over
again, because this

00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:28.026 align:middle line:84%
should have been
internalized, and it

00:32:28.026 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:90%
should have led to wholeness.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.510 align:middle line:90%
To integration.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a very good way

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of trying to understand
what's happening

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.872 align:middle line:84%
in the United States-- or
in the West in general.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we
really don't have

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
a mechanism for incorporating
spirituality in a positive way.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
We simply don't.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
It's partisan religion.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And as a
result, we-- we've

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:84%
become a culture
of serial killers.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Even though we are not
all killing, but yet

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:84%
we are part of this
militarized death machine

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
that goes and projects power.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:84%
That murders, you know,
without second thought.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Drops bombs.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Mutilates people.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And has not internalized,
in a sense, this process,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually go
to the internal state.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.885 align:middle line:84%
We can then start to welcome
our space brothers, perhaps.

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: Well, I
don't know if I want

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
to welcome the space brothers.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.402 align:middle line:90%
We're not at that point yet.

00:33:12.402 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I'd certainly like to say hi.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot
of time overseas.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And when 9/11 happened,
people were saying--

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.099 align:middle line:84%
Americans were saying--
why do they hate us?

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, this was the constant
thing you used to hear.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.223 align:middle line:90%
Why do they hate us?

00:33:28.223 --> 00:33:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Why do they hate us?

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I traveled a
lot in my life--

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.030 align:middle line:90%
since the '70s until now.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
why they hate us?

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Go overseas.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Just spend a little time
in Latin America, or Asia,

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Southeast Asia is a
good place to start.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Or Africa, or the Middle East.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:90%
You'll find out why.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a perception
of the United States

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
which I don't agree
with, necessarily.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
do a lot more good

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.130 align:middle line:90%
than we're given credit for.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you
know, our personality,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
as seen by others, is such
that we are not trusted.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.540 align:middle line:10%
We are suspected of being too
big, too powerful, too strong,

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:10%
and not in tune with what this
means to the rest of the world.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.110 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
So this is a problem
that we have.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot manage
these expectations,

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.519 align:middle line:84%
because every time we get to
the point where it looks like

00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to, you
know, make a good face,

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:90%
we go and bomb somebody.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LEVENDA: Or we go and
overthrow a country,

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.308 align:middle line:90%
or a government or something.

00:34:24.308 --> 00:34:26.679 align:middle line:84%
And we have a rationale
for doing that.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And as someone
who has, you know,

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.409 align:middle line:84%
spoken to a lot of people in
the intelligence community,

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:34.319 align:middle line:84%
in the military community
in general, and I--

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
I hang out with them.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, I joined
the association

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of former intelligence officers
so I could talk to these people

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and listen to their aspect,
their point of view.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
These are people who
believe what they're doing.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.810 align:middle line:90%
They're patriotic.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.103 align:middle line:84%
They're not people who are
out there to, you know,

00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:49.857 align:middle line:84%
demonize, you know,
the third world,

00:34:49.857 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:90%
or the developing nations.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not out there to
cause this kind of mischief.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.296 align:middle line:84%
They think, you know, they're
doing the right thing,

00:34:55.296 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and with tremendous sacrifice.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's a power
behind all of that.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
There's motivation behind
the people in the field.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Behind the people who are taking
the orders and executing them.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something else, and
they don't know what it is.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Even they don't know.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Even they don't know.

00:35:11.415 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
that has always

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:90%
fascinated me about this.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I was very upset, as
a Catholic, initially,

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:84%
learning about the
Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And not knowing why they
were not translated yet.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We found them in 1947,
for crying out loud.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, a teenager
in the '60s, thinking, well,

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:90%
what's in there?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we know
what's in there?

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.921 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we know the truth
about, you know, Jesus,

00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and the saints, and the Virgin
Mary, and all the rest of it.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:90%
You're holding back something?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:84%
This is of vital
importance to us, right?

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
As a Catholic, as a believing
Catholic, I thought,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.131 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:35:48.131 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:10%
Print this stuff,
so that we can see

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.159 align:middle line:10%
what's going on, so we know,
before we're all dead, you

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:10%
know, what is really happening.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.060 align:middle line:10%
How can we, you know,
understand this?

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:10%
As I got older and I
got older, I realized,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.813 align:middle line:10%
you know, the fix is in, baby.

00:35:58.813 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: The sinister
forces behind it.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LEVENDA: Yeah.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%

much for joining me today.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Always.

fascinating talk to you.

everything said here today.

check out his books--

00:36:14.115 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:84%
"Secret Machines," and
"The Lovecraft Code."

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:10%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:10%
and it requires
constant reassessment.
