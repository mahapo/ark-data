the Old Ones returned?

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.192 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:17.125 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Welcome
to Buzzsaw, where

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.124 align:middle line:84%
we cut through the
mainstream narrative

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.530 align:middle line:90%
to explore the hidden truths.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone, and
with me today is Walter Bosley.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:10%
He served as a
counterintelligence specialist

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
during the final years of
the Cold War for the FBI,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:10%
and as a Special Agent
with the Air Force.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he founded the Lost
Continent Library publishing

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
company, a small
press that specializes

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in classic adventure
fiction, including

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
his own works,
"Empire of the Wheel"

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and his most recent book, "Lost
in an MKULTRA House of Anu."

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Today, he enlightens
us on his research.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start
by just asking you,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:90%
you know, who is Walter Bosley?

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have an
interesting father,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and I know he informed
you, to a certain extent,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of things that I
think helped influence

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
your own writing
career and research,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and your own interests.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So just tell me a bit about
what that background is.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:10%
>>WALTER BOSLEY: I'm
basically that 12-year-old kid

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:10%
who went on to do
some pretty cool jobs,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:10%
and learned some amazing things,
and picked up some skills that

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:10%
have really propelled
me in my research

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.926 align:middle line:10%
and my personal interests.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
From the time I
was a little kid,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
my dad would tell me
stories about UFOs.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
That was how the whole
flying saucer conversation

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
entered my life,
was from my dad,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
from his interest and, of
course, his experiences.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I never lost
interest in those things,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.927 align:middle line:84%
even though I was in that
national security career path.

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And once I finished
that and came out of it,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I took all that I
learned from that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and decided to apply it to these
mysteries that had fascinated

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.757 align:middle line:90%
me from childhood.

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But what did
your father know?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did he
have these experiences?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, that's a
really interesting story.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
From the time I was
about 9 or 10 years old,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
he started telling my sisters
and I about this experience

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:90%
he'd had in the Air Force.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
He worked in a
physiological training unit.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that is is
a unit that trains

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
pilots in the use of
their life support systems

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.387 align:middle line:90%
at high altitudes.

00:02:26.387 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
They run them through
the altitude chambers,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and the pressure
suits, and all of that.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.142 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of the
ground schooling,

00:02:32.142 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and part of the ground
training and maintenance

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
training for pilots.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was in in the
mid-to-late '50s, US Air Force.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And this also had him assigned
to retrieval-- crash retrieval

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.777 align:middle line:84%
teams, which is a very
interesting topic in itself,

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
when you connect it
with the Air Force

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
talking about here.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had been taken to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
while he was on
another assignment.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And he and the guys in his unit
were briefed in on Roswell--

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
what, basically, had
really happened in Roswell.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
At this time, it was
just 10 years prior.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were told what
it was, who it was.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were told
that it happened again

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:90%
in eastern Arizona.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is 1958.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So from Wright-Patterson,
after they

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
were briefed in on Roswell
and this situation,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
they were taken
to eastern Arizona

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
to, essentially, what was
an underground facility,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
because another
craft had crashed,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
just like at Roswell,
this time east

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
of Winslow, which I've
pinpointed around the Holbrook

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And the people who owned the
craft, the civilization that it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
came from, had come to the
US Air Force for their help

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
to find their pilot,
because he was still alive,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and he was lost.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
This was the story
that my dad had told me

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
from the time I was a kid.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So imagine that.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I knew most of
this story before I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
went to work for the FBI, before
I became an Air Force officer,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and so--

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So before I ask you what
the civilization is, or was,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.116 align:middle line:84%
that had sent the craft,
what kind of craft

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
What was the-- sort
of the structure,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:90%
or the features of it?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: He didn't
describe that.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:90%
He didn't describe it.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:90%
All he would say--

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
he insisted all his life,
after he told the story,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that this craft was
piloted by human beings,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
that what crashed at
Roswell were human beings.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.090 align:middle line:90%
He used to insist on that.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And whenever he'd hear the
stories about the gray aliens,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
he would shake his head
and say, no, no, no.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
They're covering for
something, or they're disinfo,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, because
that is not who

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and what they retrieved
from even Roswell,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and again, not from this
situation in eastern Arizona.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was a craft of a
technology I would say parallel

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to ours, because it came from
this parallel civilization

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.045 align:middle line:90%
that he was told about.

00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:17.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that this
parallel civilization

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
are essentially-- are the
descendants of the Anunnaki,

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that essentially were
supposed to have left,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but instead went underground, or
somewhere more hidden from us?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: It's-- he
was told that, indeed,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
it was a civilization that, in
the very remote, ancient past,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
there had been a surface
cataclysm on the earth.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And humanity had gone--
indeed, gone underground.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them stayed and
developed their own technology,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
their own civilization, and
wanted nothing to do with us.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's one
of the things he

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
was told in the late '50s,
when their craft crashed

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, was, look,
they want our help to find him.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But they really don't want
anything else to do with us.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that
actually, that might

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
have been a beginning
of a technology transfer

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
type of situation.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk about
the Anunnaki, in my view,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
there are two
groups within that.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that when you're
talking about the ancient war

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
from the remote past, talked
about in the Mahabharata

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient
sources, and it very often

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
talks about how a conflict
came to our planet--

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%
these two warring factions.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And the defeated faction ends
up here, essentially chased here

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
by the victors.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
They are both Anunnaki
in the sense that they

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
come from the Anunnaki
world or system,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
but they are opposing factions
within their own civilization.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, what you have
are two Anunnaki factions

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that have been messing
around in human history.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And the one which stayed
here and has initially

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
helped human civilization
advance, and such, and it

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
comes and it goes,
it stays hidden--

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
they would be the one
that, in my opinion,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is more friendly to us, because
they correspond to the--

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
in Irish mythology, there's
a group called the Tuatha De

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Dananns, OK?

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you read about
them, they come from the sky,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
they have this old enemy that
also comes from somewhere else

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that they have these
conflicts with,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and they pop up in other
mythologies around the world.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
There's one theory
that they were

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious megalith builder
civilizations in the Americas,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
because then, when you go to
the Irish lore of the Tuathas,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
you have them
returning to Ireland

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
after they've been away.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you dig into the inside
baseball on this civilization

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and these people, you
begin to see similarities

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in what my dad was told about
this secret civilization that's

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
been coexisting with us,
that he was told in the '50s.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar
with the lore, so I

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
was seeing the
similarities pop up

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:90%
with what my dad had told me.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I was recognizing the
Tuatha De Dananns.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm by no means the
first to recognize that,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
because Jacques Vallee
has been talking

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
about this same group
for 30 years as a result

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
of his research
and investigations

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
into similar cases
and situations.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what role, then, does
MKULTRA and the House of Anu--

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
what mind control element is
there, involved in your story?

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it have to do
with the fact of how, perhaps,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
these Anunnaki have
actually mind-controlled us,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
or in some way controlled
our perception of reality?

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Do we not see them
on a daily basis?

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Or have they been able
to control our perceptors

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
so we can't see them, or if
they were showing themselves

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
in front of us, would we
see them as these beings?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Right.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what has come
to be known as the fairy

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
lore, which really,
when you dig into it,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
that's who these beings are.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
the fairy folk can do.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
It's called glamory, OK?

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
When you see them, and they
don't want you to see them,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
they have this ability to
shimmer themselves, make

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
themselves look different,
and actually wipe your memory.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about the fact

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about such
a civilization and a group

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:84%
of people, a culture, mixed
in with my dad's story,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that you have the
MKULTRA element also there,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
where did these guys really get
the MKULTRA concepts and ideas?

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Because specifically as
it relates to my dad,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
he was in the exact right
specialty in the Air Force

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
where this was being done.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:90%
He was in aerospace medicine.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I was doing the
research on Operation Paperclip

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and MKULTRA, I would
just get goosebumps,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
because I had no idea, even
after all the years my dad

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
had told me, when I
really dug into MKULTRA,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
how at the heart of the
whole MKULTRA development

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:90%
my dad would have been.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the one branch that
was most enthusiastic of the US

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
military on MKULTRA
things was the Air Force.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The Army did some
stuff, the Navy

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
did a little bit,
but the Air Force--

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:90%
MKULTRA really turned them on.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is, when
the Church Committee brought

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
this all out publicly
in the '70s--

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
1973, I think-- that was
all CIA mind control stuff.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.871 align:middle line:84%
What the military did, and what
the Air Force specifically did

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
with this, because
they branched off

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and did their own, that still,
to this day, remains a secret.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And there is a possibility, when
you dig into my dad's story,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that they had used the
MKULTRA methods to suppress

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
his memories of this,
essentially, retrieval

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
operation that went on
underground in eastern Arizona.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's how MKULTRA directly
applied, in my opinion,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.595 align:middle line:90%
to my dad's situation.

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that the
MKULTRA could be used--

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mind control
could be used to,

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
as you say, to wipe memories
or to suppress memories

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that people would have had
of having UFO experiences,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:90%
or encounters, or retrievals.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But in his case, he didn't
seem to have been wiped.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He was clear on what
he remembered, no?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes and no.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
See, I was told by
a trustworthy source

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that I had in the intelligence
community for years that--

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
he was the one who told me
that my dad's memories of what

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.630 align:middle line:84%
happened in Arizona, during
this retrieval operation,

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:90%
were suppressed.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And the suppression--
they used hypnosis, OK?

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And the hypnosis was refreshed
every month of his life,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of his
life, decades afterwards,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.629 align:middle line:84%
because it was keyed to
the phases of the moon.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They had-- apparently, the Air
Force-- and this is something,

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:84%
when you read in the MKULTRA
annals, they could never--

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
they had a hard
time figuring out,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.292 align:middle line:84%
how do we keep the
hypnosis refreshed?

00:12:38.292 --> 00:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently, the
Air Force figured it out,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:84%
because I was told
every full moon,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it would be refreshed in
my dad's subconscious.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
pressed down further.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, over time, it
breaks down, of course.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:90%
And that is what happened.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more
astonishing details

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
came out as he got older
and as his health declined,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
when he started having his
heart issues and such, you know.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:90%
It broke it down.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion, based
on what I was told,

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
it was used to
suppress his memories.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So this breakaway
civilization that

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:90%
you're describing--

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.329 align:middle line:90%
is this what you coin--

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you don't really coin
the term, but you use

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
the term NYMZA to describe it.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Would you-- sort of the
Nameless Ones, right?

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Is that the name for the
breakaway civilization

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:90%
as you use it?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, of course,
I think there are two.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
NYMZA, that name comes
from Charles Dellschau,

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
the very interesting and
mysterious artist who

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
chronicled the equally
mysterious activities

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of the Sonora Aero
Club in the 1850s.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that this group
in California in the 1850s,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that was playing
around with flying

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
machines and
anti-gravity technology,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
if you can believe
it, that they were

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
under the aegis, the umbrella,
of the very shadowy NYMZA

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
organization,
headquartered in Germany.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Charles Dellschau
was the first guy

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that introduced us all to--
the whole world to NYMZA.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1923, in his 90s.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
In my research, as I've
tried to flesh out and find

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
the Sonora Aero Club

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Airship
Mysteries of the 1890s,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I did indeed find
where there certainly

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
was this German apparatus,
this German group, that

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:84%
fit the bill to be this NYMZA
that Dellschau talks about,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.615 align:middle line:84%
and then is mentioned again
in the 1890s Airship Mystery.

00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:39.698 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, could it
have been the Vril society,

00:14:39.698 --> 00:14:41.084 align:middle line:90%
what became of Vril society?

00:14:41.084 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: NYMZA-- you've
got to look at it this way.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:90%
NYMZA first, right?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
NYMZA, yes, would have
been the organization that

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.339 align:middle line:90%
motivated the Vril society.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
NYMZA would have been
the organization that

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:90%
motivated the Thule society.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And yes, in my opinion, NYMZA
was behind the formation

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Nazi party.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And NYMZA, to this day,
I think, still exists.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And on the face
of it, they would

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.742 align:middle line:84%
be who we call the New World
Order, or the Illuminati.

00:15:11.742 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
globalist guys that

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
want to kind of keep
everything under their control.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
The Nazi International that
Joseph Farrell speaks about,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
writes about a lot, would be,
definitely, a NYMZA apparatus.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So the great Airship
Mystery of 1896, right?

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That's reported
across the country

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.952 align:middle line:90%
as various sightings of--

00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And what do people see?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Is it like planes in the sky?

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it saucers?

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, not
saucers, not planes.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Flying machines that weren't
exactly Zeppelins or blimps.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They might have
been cigar shaped,

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.264 align:middle line:84%
but they had spinning parts,
flapping parts, in some cases.

00:15:55.264 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, when you
read the descriptions,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
it's almost kind of
comical, the description.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:10%
But in most of the
cases, you're looking

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:10%
at a very mechanical
type device that's

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.880 align:middle line:10%
using some type of
technology for the propulsion

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:10%
and being able to
remain in the air,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:10%
in the sky, that was not a
Zeppelin or a dirigible, OK?

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
moved way too fast.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, the
witnesses were brought on board,

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and they were told that
it was a technology that

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:84%
used resonance, which is
interesting-- you know,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:90%
vibratory technology.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And it, in my opinion,
was the advanced version

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of what the guys in
the 1850s were doing.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Theirs were very rudimentary.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
They were-- many
of them just looked

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
like baskets with these
contraptions on them.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they did make
more advanced ones.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
There's one right
there, as an example.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It was still kind of the Model
T, Jalopy version of what

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:90%
was in the 1890s.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting--
a really interesting story,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.204 align:middle line:84%
when you see how it
does tie together.

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: But at this point--

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.462 align:middle line:84%
I mean, presumably,
the NYMZA, which

00:17:20.462 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is a breakaway
civilization, they already

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.437 align:middle line:84%
have highly advanced
craft, right?

00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So why would they-- why
would you see an evolution

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
in the craft that are being
designed and made by any subset

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
of the NYMZA group?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, in
the 1890s, their craft

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
weren't any more
advanced than what

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
people were seeing in the
skies, because in the 1850s,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the level of advancement
that the NYMZA had was

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
what those guys were
doing-- these jalopies

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.925 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about.

00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
The NYMZA, as such,
as an organization,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
yes, you see the development
of their technology

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:90%
through the 19th century--

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:90%
start at this rudimentary--

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I have this chart that-- this is
where I get my Model T example

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
where I show the
airship stuff and UFOs.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I show the Model--

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I show a Model T car,
I show a '58 Buick,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and then I show a
1986 Porsche, OK?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Model T is
what Dellschau said

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:90%
they were doing in the 1850s.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The Buick-- you know, compare
a '58 Buick to a Model T.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:84%
To us, a '58 Buick is
still an old car, right?

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But compared to the
Model T, it's advanced.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Same with the 1890s airship.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.493 align:middle line:84%
Compare that to the Dellschau,
and that's like the Buick

00:18:33.493 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to the Model T. And then
when you get to the S1 model,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
for example, flying
saucer out at Area 51,

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
the silver, classic
flying saucer,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that's like what the '86 Porsche
was to the '58 Buick, right?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look at
the progression that way.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:90%
The NYMZA did not--

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
from my research,
and in my opinion,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
what I've seen in my analysis--

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
the NYMZA did not get this
really advanced technology

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
like we're talking about
today until the post-World War

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:90%
II era.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.754 align:middle line:84%
That's when that
really, really took off.

00:19:04.754 --> 00:19:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So the NYMZA
themsleves are then

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:90%
dependent on an alien factor.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The NYMZA, you're saying,
are not the alien--

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
the alien factor,
being, I'm saying,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki alien,
being a race that's

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.167 align:middle line:84%
ancient, that came--
that obviously

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:90%
had tremendous technology.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: An ancient human race.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right,
ancient human race.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.014 align:middle line:90%
That's not the NYMZA.

00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The NYMZA are basically still
dependent on this other,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
this more ancient race, to give
them access and information

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:90%
to build the technology.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: I think
there's somebody--

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's
somebody behind NYMZA.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
NYMZA is beholden to some
group or civilization, yeah.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And what
happened with 1903?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Apparently there was-- according
to some reports, there was,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:90%
by 1903, there had been--

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
humans had basically
gone to Mars, right?

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a report,
or a newspaper article,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that said that there had been
some level of transport that

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:90%
had been taken to Mars.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: There is a theory,
based on some rumors.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And Sean Casteel is a guy
who's written a book about,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:90%
did Tesla go to Mars, OK?

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this book, he talks about
the NYMZA and all these airship

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
groups that I talk, and that
we're talking about here.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is
that Tesla designed

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
one of these ships
for these guys

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
to attempt a flight to Mars,
a manned flight to Mars.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And the story goes that nobody
knows what happened to them.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
They went, and never
heard from them again.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:90%
They never returned.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the milieu in
which Casteel has

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
been able to point to
Tesla moving around

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in with this airship group
are the same airship guys,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and people that turn up in the
1890s Airship Mystery, which

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I personally link
to what I think

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:84%
was the first American
black project, started right

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:90%
after the Civil War.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And this group, if
they successfully--

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
this is where my
theory comes in--

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
if this crazy, insane attempt
to go to Mars in 1903--

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have to remember
how crazy as that sounds,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
but when you have the context
of what I'm talking about here,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a little less crazy that
someone would attempt it.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But if they attempted
it, and survived,

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and actually got there,
might they have said,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%
hey, wait a minute.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Look what we can do.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing this stuff
for this government or that,

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Why not just kind of
do it for ourselves?

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Look what we found on Mars.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And by the age-old
law of exploration,

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.841 align:middle line:84%
you know, they--
finders, keepers.

00:21:54.841 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
In those days, they
found it, it's theirs.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So huge speculation, a
gigantic if, but it's

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.454 align:middle line:84%
very compelling when you look
at what's leading up to this.

00:22:06.454 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about this,

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.328 align:middle line:84%
people say, well, what about
life support systems and such?

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was a guy named--

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
his name was Oliver Heaviside,
and he had developed

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.474 align:middle line:90%
this theory, gravity--

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I always get it wrong.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.153 align:middle line:84%
It's called GEM, G-E-M,
Gravito-Electric Magnetics,

00:22:26.153 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
In essence, you apply this,
you can create a force field

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:90%
around an object, OK?

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And in that force
field, perhaps, you

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:90%
could sustain life.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.235 align:middle line:90%
So if they were--

00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and Heaviside did his
stuff in the 1890s, OK?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So here we have 1903.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
If they applied Heaviside's
theories to this airship

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.570 align:middle line:84%
technology, they could have
put a protective bubble

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:84%
around this ship that both
got them through the radiation

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in space, the Van
Allen belts and such,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.449 align:middle line:84%
and also provided
whatever life support

00:22:59.449 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
they had to create the
oxygen, or whatever,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
it also would protect
them from the hazards.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
If, if, if speculation
all over the place, but--

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.096 align:middle line:84%
But so, if we go back to
the NYMZA and this question

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
of a breakaway civilization
that has the ability

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
to create spacecraft,
the ability

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to create the craft that people
see in the sky in the 1890s,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're based in
Germany, why don't we

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.565 align:middle line:84%
see Germany win the first
and second world wars?

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Ah.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I honestly don't have
an answer for that,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
other than, again, if the
1903 attempt was successful,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:90%
that they were busy elsewhere.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They were choosing to,
for whatever reason,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.224 align:middle line:84%
they were absent, as
far as we can tell.

00:23:45.224 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I honestly don't know that--

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.015 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because
certainly, it's certain

00:23:48.015 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that Vril's channeling
the designs for aircraft,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.747 align:middle line:90%
or the Nazis, and whatnot.

00:23:51.747 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But again, none of this
gets applied, none of this

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
gets implemented during
the Second World War, so--

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.002 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, now,
the Germans, of course,

00:23:59.002 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking
about the Vril,

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about the Germans.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They were putting those
eggs in the Bell basket.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying
to develop this stuff.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And I think they were getting--

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I think they got the Bell
directly from the NYMZA,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
because Dellschau, in
some of his drawings

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
from the late 1800s, draws one
of these craft from the 1850s,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and it literally has--

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
it's pictured in
there-- the Bell.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:10%
It's bell shaped.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.061 align:middle line:84%
It rotates, it does all
the things that Witkowski,

00:24:30.061 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and Farrell, and everybody who's
written about the Bell talk

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
about the Bell doing.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And so actually,
the Germans were

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to develop this
stuff during the war.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, the real question
is, this other group,

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:90%
where the heck were they?

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, let's go back to the
fact that they're a breakaway.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.914 align:middle line:84%
The very nature of a breakaway
is, we want to break away,

00:24:50.914 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
we're tired of
this, we don't want

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:84%
any more part of our country,
or people, or whatever.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that was
their attitude.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
propose in my work,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:84%
is that they did not like the
direction the 20th century was

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.829 align:middle line:84%
going, so maybe they
just chose to bow out.

00:25:05.829 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: One of the
interesting things about Trump

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is that, obviously,
he has German lineage.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And you've looked
into his ancestry

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.206 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
of, I think it

00:25:16.206 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
was his grandfather or
his great-grandfather,

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to some aspect of the breakaway
civilization in the NYMZA?

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:90%
What is that, now?

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Yes.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Gentleman Stephen Romano, who
is one of the authors of this

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
fantastic-- the best
book on Dellschau's art--

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
you can see all these aeros,
Dellschau called them.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And Romano's the guy that,
his gallery in New York

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:90%
put that out.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And he contacted me
not too long ago,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
pointing out that there was a
Trump in the Sonora arrow club.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at Donald Trump,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and you see that his
great-grandfather came over

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
here from Germany at about
the right time, right

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
before the 1890s
Airship Mystery,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
it's very intriguing, because
he comes from Germany.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.280 align:middle line:84%
There was a Homer
Trump in the airship

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:90%
club in Sonora, California.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's even pictures that
Dellschau did of the design

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
that this Homer Trump gave.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.565 align:middle line:90%
It's got the Trump name on it.

00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
interesting, is

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:84%
these were done in the late
1800s, there's the Trump name.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But the connection, the
really significant connection,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is that Donald Trump's uncle,
who was an electrical engineer,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
was the guy who, when
Nikola Tesla died--

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Trump's uncle was the
guy who the FBI asked

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:55.437 align:middle line:84%
to review Tesla's secret
papers, for whatever reason--

00:26:55.437 --> 00:26:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's anything
useful for national security,

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
because we were in the
middle of the war then.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And Trump's uncle comes
back, and the story

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:84%
goes that he says, well, there's
some very interesting concepts

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
here, but you know,
nothing that's going to--

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.172 align:middle line:90%
that you can apply right now.

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're told.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.005 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: OK, but we know a lot
of those papers disappeared.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that man's
nephew goes on to become

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
this billionaire-- successful
billionaire construction

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
magnate, and now president
of the United States.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And from my perspective--

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's why Stephen Romano
had tipped me off to this.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
He goes, hey, take
a look at this.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was a
bombshell, because,

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective
of the influence

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and the power that these
breakaways appear to have,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.427 align:middle line:90%
it's no surprise, then.

00:27:48.427 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, but don't we
already know that breakaways

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.635 align:middle line:90%
have a relationship--

00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they ultimately--

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:84%
would you say that the breakaway
civilization ultimately has

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:84%
elements within our
government, or do

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.817 align:middle line:84%
they simply have
their own agenda,

00:28:00.817 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and occasionally
they crash land here,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and the US government
has to go and grab--

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:84%
grab their crashed
UFOs and retrieve them,

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and occasionally they give us
technology to back-engineer.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.333 align:middle line:84%
But what would the
deal ultimately be,

00:28:14.333 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:90%
and what would the ultimate--

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.657 align:middle line:84%
as far as you understand--
the relationship between,

00:28:18.657 --> 00:28:21.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, the US government
and this breakaway civilization

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
what would it ultimately
look like, do you think?

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Well, if you're
talking about the NYMZA,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
relationship between the
US government and the NYMZA

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:90%
would be what we've had.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It's called the military
industrial complex.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.255 align:middle line:84%
Particularly from
the neo-conservative,

00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:84%
the neo-con perspective, that's
what it would look like--

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
an almost fascistic obsession
with, keep the complex going.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.190 align:middle line:90%
So keep the wars going, keep--

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
again, you go back to the 1850s
with the Sonora Aero Club,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and the NYMZA back
then wanted these guys

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:90%
to turn these into war machines.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And the guys doing this were--

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.167 align:middle line:90%
no, they refused.

00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:84%
They go, we don't want to turn
these things into war machines.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But the German organization--
that's what they wanted.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And same thing
post-World War II.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we'll help you
with your technology.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Between what we've developed
and what we've been given access

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:90%
to, we'll help you.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:90%
But this is what you need to do.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
think the history--

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.910 align:middle line:84%
the post-World War II history of
the military industrial complex

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:90%
has been covered a lot.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people see
what that manifestation is.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, so you
would say it's not

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
at all an understatement
to say that the US

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:84%
government and the powers that
be have access to technology

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that's probably anywhere
from 20 to 30 years

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.659 align:middle line:84%
ahead of what we everyday
people are given?

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, sure, sure.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that even stuff
that our guys develop,

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
who are not part of this secret
deal, that are engineers--

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.859 align:middle line:84%
you know, aviation technology
and other technology, too.

00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I come from the
aviation perspective,

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:90%
having been Air Force.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
They've always said, that's
always 20 years ahead

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of what you know about, is the
fastest, highest-flying thing.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But particularly with this
breakaway stuff, yeah.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would say 30
years is a good median.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, it might
be 50 years ahead.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.100 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't put it that--

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:84%
too much beyond that ahead,
because otherwise, I think

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:90%
they would be more open.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I think they would come out
and just be more tyrannical,

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:90%
out in the open.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, that does beg
the final question, which

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
is, the breakaway civilization
you've studied, now,

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity-- you've
studied the esoteric

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.059 align:middle line:84%
and the occult nature of a lot
of the power structures, right?

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The alien history--
what do you think

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.808 align:middle line:84%
the goal of the breakaway
civilization ultimately is?

00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are they using
humans for a specific end?

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Do they not care about humans,
they have their own agenda?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Yes to all
of that, absolutely.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
They do have their own agenda.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
They are using us.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I think it varies.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
They'll use us as slaves
when it suits them.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They'll use us as sources
of a certain type of energy.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I think what has happened
is, the human breakaway--

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:84%
the one that I use the NYMZA
label on, who I call the bad

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:90%
guys, so to speak--

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I think they've
allied themselves

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:84%
with a very old, old
civilization, an old Elder One,

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, as Lovecraft
likes to call them.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they get the
more esoteric, more nefarious

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:48.060 align:middle line:84%
uses of the more full, broad
spectrum of reality, where

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.550 align:middle line:84%
the occult and these unseen
forces, type of things,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:90%
come into play.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
shy about using it.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, they don't-- you
know, they're elitists.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.980 align:middle line:90%
They are true elitists.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And they'll use that
stuff on whoever

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.555 align:middle line:84%
and whatever to
justify their agenda.

00:32:07.555 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: So do you think that
your research can ultimately

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:10%
help people to understand the
world they live in better?

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BOSLEY: I hope so.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:10%
I hope what it helps do is
identify players, and help

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.386 align:middle line:10%
the people be able to
better read what's going on.

00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
There's so much out there
that it's just so complex,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and they keep coming at
us and keeping it complex,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes it's hard
to keep the scorecard.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And I hope what I'm
doing, just kind

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.831 align:middle line:84%
of starting with a
historical perspective--

00:32:41.831 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
because that's the other
thing I'm hoping to do,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is show people that this
whole breakaway thing did not

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:90%
start with World War II, OK?

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:90%
It goes farther back than that.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what I've found--

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.712 align:middle line:84%
and others, that's what
Dellschau was saying,

00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that's what everybody who's
written about the Airship

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Mystery--

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
what we're saying,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:90%
is it goes back farther.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah, deeper.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Walter, for joining me.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOSLEY: Oh, thanks
for having me on.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.862 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:33:08.862 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Some fascinating insights
from Walter Bosley.

You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge you
to check out his work

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:10%
at
empireofthewheel.blogspot.com,

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:10%
as well as his new book, "Lost
in an MKULTRA House of Anu."

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
along the buzzsaw's edge and
requires constant reassessment.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.962 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:33:29.962 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.
