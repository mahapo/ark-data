00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE: Blink 182, "Star
Wars," and David Wilcock.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.115 align:middle line:84%
Let's blast off and
enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.085 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:18.622 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Welcome to
"Buzzsaw," where

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.704 align:middle line:84%
we cut through the
mainstream narrative

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to explore the hidden truths.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.609 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
And joining me today is David
Wilcock, professional lecturer,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:10%
filmmaker, and researcher
of ancient civilizations,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, science, and new
paradigms of matter and energy.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
His new book is called
"Ascension Mysteries."

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:10%
So today, we'll be delving into
all of the above and much more,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:10%
starting with the
Wikileaks disclosures

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:10%
of certain emails between John
Podesta and Blink-182's Tom

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:10%
DeLonge.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the emails are
talking about disclosing

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
aliens and UFOs and their
desire to see this occur.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But we already knew that
DeLonge was fascinated by aliens

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and believes in basically
aliens and UFOs,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
and we know Podesta's a
longtime advocate of disclosure.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.109 align:middle line:84%
So what have we learned that's
new from these Wikileaks?

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID WILCOCK: Well, Sean,
this is absolutely mind-blowing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:10%
what's going on here.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:10%
First of all, no one has
disputed that these Wikileaks

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:10%
are, in fact, authentic emails.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
No one is trying to come
up with any counterargument

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:90%
to say, oh, this is BS.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Somebody concocted this in
the laboratory in Russia.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%
They're real, and it's provable.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So what makes this different
is, as you and I both know,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
we've been tracking this
Blink-182 Tom DeLonge story,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge has been
out there having

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
major interviews with
entities like "Rolling Stone"

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.341 align:middle line:84%
magazine saying that he's
got 10 different insiders

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
at need-to-know levels
higher than the president

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of the United States and that
they're giving him information

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in advance of a disclosure,
that they want him to be

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
part of a formal disclosure.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And yes, as you
also said, Sean, we

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
do know that Podesta has been
pushing for that in the Clinton

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
His epic tweet at
the end of his time

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
said, my biggest
regret is that I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't get disclosure
of the UFO files,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
hashtag
#thetruthisoutthere, right?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But what makes this unique is
that we have Wikileaks coming

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
out of Tom DeLonge and
Edgar Mitchell, both of whom

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
are setting up Skype
conversations with John

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Podesta.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
When you actually look at
the content of the emails

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
themselves and what the
emails actually are saying,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
we have Edgar Mitchell
weighing in saying

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that these
extraterrestrials will not

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
allow us to commit acts of
violence or massive aggression

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, that they're blocking
all that from happening.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
We have Tom DeLonge
reaching out to Podesta

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and saying that he's in
contact with a guy who ran

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
the place where EBE was taken.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say EBE, but basically
the Roswell extraterrestrial

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
was taken to
Wright-Patterson and where

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
all that spooky stuff has
been kept ever since Roswell.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
That it's apparently been one
guy, who's obviously really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
old now, who's been
running the whole thing,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and that Tom is
going to facilitate

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a meeting between
this guy and Podesta.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There's this whole
compartmentalized separate

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
aspect of the
military-industrial complex

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that is totally removed
from what is going on

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:90%
with the governments.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, your father's so
well known for the "JFK" film.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally blowing
the whistle on the fact

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that there is an organized
cabal that doesn't necessarily

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
even want the president
to be alive, much

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
less to have any information.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, right.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me
wonder, really, based

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
on the interviews, for example,
where Hillary Clinton is asked

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
on television whether or not she
would disclose the UFO presence

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:90%
and documents and whatnot.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And coupled with things
like Wikileaks disclosures,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.699 align:middle line:84%
are we already living
in a time of disclosure?

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Is this what disclosure
is actually looking like?

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.924 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to come from
official representatives

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
opening up and saying, yes,
we're in touch with ETs.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.665 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to come
through things like Wikileaks

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
or other sources?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: This is definitely
a part of the disclosure

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's moving the ball forward
in a very dramatic way.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing things that we
never thought we would see.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:10%
We have the former Canadian
Minister of Defense Paul

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:10%
Hellyer out there saying that
there are ETs walking around

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:10%
with green cards and allowed
to hang out in Las Vegas

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:10%
and dress up a little bit
so that we don't notice

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:10%
that they look any different.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is crazy stuff.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And to have an Apollo astronaut,
a hero, openly saying now

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that he's met with so many
different insiders who

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
confirmed Roswell.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
He met with like all the Roswell
witnesses, all the surviving

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:90%
witnesses.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.009 align:middle line:84%
And he's met with dozens
and dozens of people

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
who were working at nuclear
missile installations

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
where UFOs appeared and powered
down the whole installation.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: So if Edgar Mitchell
is meeting with Podesta and Tom

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
DeLonge is meeting
with Podesta--

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and in case of our audience is
not really aware of Blink-182,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about arguably the
most popular band of the 1990s.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this is
just another group.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Blink-182 probably
got broken up by this,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that they've now replaced
Tom DeLonge with another lead

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
singer, and that it was
likely his delving into this

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial arena
that led to that happening.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So we also have Tom
DeLonge writing a book,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:84%
or co-authoring a book, called
"Secret Machines," which

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
is supposedly based on
all real information,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and he says that
at the beginning.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It is fictional, but
we're only using fiction

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to kind of tell the
stories of all these things

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
in the book that are true.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's going right
into the Nazi Bell craft.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been able to
read the whole thing yet,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's astonishing how all
these things are lining up.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that mean that
that's what disclosure will be?

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe at this point.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.267 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's going to
get a lot more intense.

00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We're hearing that
there's going to be

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
a military-industrial complex
space program that they will

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
announce that will include
triangular craft and two

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.575 align:middle line:84%
big satellite platforms that
they have already in place

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And once they disclose that,
it'll be just like the stealth,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're hoping that
they can kind of write off

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
all the other UFO
speculation by doing this.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what are you
saying, essentially,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
is that there's the Cabal
component of disclosure, which

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is basically trying to
utilize the alien presence

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
as a way of bringing a new
world order into effect or world

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
government or world
authority into effect.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
That's more of the
Kabbalah agenda.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the benevolent
agenda would be to recognize,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, these aliens
are not here to hurt us.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, at least,
are not here to hurt us.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a
tremendous consciousness,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
galactic consciousness,
out there,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and we need to basically
start to recognize

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
our galactic humanity.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
What you're describing
there is more

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of a long-term
historical view of what

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:84%
we were seeing as the
possibilities of disclosure.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the
false-flag alien invasion

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
card is going to be
able to be pulled.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the cabal is
going to get their alien 9/11.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They certainly have
wanted to, but it

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
does appear that there are
bigger kids on the playground

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that are blocking them very
systematically from being

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
able to implement the fake alien
invasion, which, of course,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
as they telegraphed in so many
propaganda-based Hollywood

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
films, they wanted to create
their new world order that way.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be
able to vaporize

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
entire cities of
people that they

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:84%
felt would be insurgents,
get rid of them

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:90%
right at the beginning.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody has to
unite under a world government.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Part of this disclosure
process, and there's

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of infighting as to
how this is going to happen

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
or when it's going
to happen, but it

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
does appear that a
big part of disclosure

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
is the revealing of the Cabal.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, one of the
things that came out recently

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:84%
in the disclosures was
this whole superstructure

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that is speculated to be
mining a distant star, right?

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists are
saying it's actually

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:90%
sort of a Dyson sphere, right?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.724 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of
structure out there

00:08:33.724 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that's actually drawing
energy from this distant star.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
fascinating disclosure

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to have been made
because it would

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.469 align:middle line:84%
mean an alien civilization
that's within sight of us.

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: That's right.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right?

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So what do you make
of that disclosure?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that coming from
the Cabal, or is that

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
coming from the white
hats in the military?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: Well,
that's a good question.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The star had some
name like KIC 8493492.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And they've now
changed to Tabby's Star

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
because the superstructure was
discovered by a woman named

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Tabetha Boyajian.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So Tabby's Star is what
they're calling it now.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
strange situation

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
because you have
official publications,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
scientific publications,
in which they are saying

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
anomalous dimmings,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
as if gigantic chunks
are moving past the star,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
but they're not moving along
the orbital ecliptic, which

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is where you'd
expect planets to be.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:84%
They've essentially ruled
out all other explanations

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of conventional physics.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no other stars they've
ever seen that do this.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in these
mainstream journaled

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
academic publications,
they're actually

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
saying this appears to be
a swarm of megastructures,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
intelligently, artificially
built, orbiting a star.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Recently, there have now been
two other potentials that have

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:90%
been identified as being this.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have the book
cover right here.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I had said in the
book that there

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
was going to be two others
that would come out.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
That just happened
after the book came out.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Cabal lost
face because I already

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:90%
had that intel in the book.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Now they actually have
to do it so that people

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:90%
don't make that connection.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
How did David know that?

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
How did he know there
was going to be two more?

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.932 align:middle line:84%
If we have a star that
has gigantic energy

00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
collectors around it, because
that's what they think it is,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
it's like a very advanced
solar energy system,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
then we're looking at a
civilization with technology

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
that is orders of magnitude
more advanced than ours.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
We also have had
very bizarre findings

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
about that the overall
brightness of the star

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
has dimmed over the course
of the last century.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And that now, in the
last three years,

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing that
it's dimmed even more

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
at a very pronounced
rate, suggesting

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:84%
that the building
of these structures

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is accelerating
very dramatically,

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:00.129 align:middle line:84%
and it's making the star
dimmer than it used to be.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So what I said in the
book, and what I will still

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
stand by today,
is it does appear

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
benevolent ET group that

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
is demanding disclosure.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't
get it, they're

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:84%
striking at the
heart of the Cabal.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And this includes things
like completely portaling out

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
entire massive underground
cities that the Cabal really

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:90%
needed for their infrastructure.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
The personnel get
taken out safely,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and then the entire thing
is completely destroyed.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So they're losing
very valuable assets.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And they are having
to make treaties

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.244 align:middle line:84%
with these benevolent ETs to
disclose on a certain timeline,

00:11:36.244 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and if they don't
do that, they're

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
going to keep losing
more and more and more.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are a whole series
of very interesting things

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that have started to come out,
mostly since 2012, that seem

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:90%
to indicate this being done.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.846 align:middle line:84%
And this would include
them telling us

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that there could
be as many as 40

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
billion watery Earth-like
planets just in our galaxy.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
40 billion Earths?

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The fact that now most of
the moons in our solar system

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
have water around them,
and if they thaw out they

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
would be like the Earth.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:90%
They'd be watery planets.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Mars had oceans
like the Earth at one time.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:90%
This is big, big stuff.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that megastructure
around Tabby's Star

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:84%
is just another
one of those things

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that the Cabal is
essentially being forced

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to do by benevolent
ETs because they're

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.122 align:middle line:90%
being held to a timeline.

00:12:24.122 --> 00:12:26.538 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Would you say that the
wars that we're looking at,

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
particularly the war with
Russia and the US, UK, I mean,

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that's as bad as we've ever
seen going back to the Cold War.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It's getting to that place
of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
this is evidence

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of a division within
the Cabal itself,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
basically two factions
within the Cabal itself,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
or we're looking at benevolent
ETs versus the Cabal

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.261 align:middle line:90%
in that situation?

00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I have different
insiders that give me different

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
viewpoints.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
There is at least one
insider I can think of,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.319 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to out him
or call on him specifically,

00:12:57.319 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:90%
so we'll keep it generic.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
this guy is trying

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to disinform me more to sort
of favor the Rockefeller

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
side of this Rockefeller
versus Rothschild

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
historical division that we
see between Europe and America.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you listen
to him, then he's

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
basically parroting this
line that it's all the Cabal.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And Russia is just one faction,
and the US is another faction,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's a fake conflict.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're just setting this
up to try to create a war.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I honestly don't believe that.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I
can rule that out

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
because I have many
other insiders telling me

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, there is
an alliance that really

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:90%
wants to defeat the Cabal.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
interesting thing.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the Russians.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
majority of people

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
who used to work
for the Pentagon

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
but got thrown out
when they were asked,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
would you fire on an
unarmed American civilian,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and they said no.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.802 align:middle line:84%
And they get transferred
to another base.

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.635 align:middle line:84%
Two years later, the
base is decommissioned,

00:13:58.635 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
and they lose their jobs.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's done.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So if these guys are actually
wanting to defeat the Cabal,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
they need to work with
people who still have

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%
the worldly power to do that.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Russians and
actually a majority

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
of the US military-industrial
complex and retired military

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:90%
are actually working together.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
think is going on.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, personally I came
to a certain realization

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
recently about the
nature of "Star Wars."

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Because first of
all, Lucas, his name

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
very much resonates
with Lusus, Lusus

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
being light,
light-bringer, right.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that what he was
trying to say with "Star Wars"

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually not only our
past, but also our future,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.056 align:middle line:90%
that the force is real.

00:14:38.056 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a known force
within the universe,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.429 align:middle line:90%
that there's two sides to it.

00:14:41.429 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And really what he's
saying is, well,

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
if we follow this
path of militarization

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and transhumanism,
that will take us

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to the militarization of
space and beyond, right?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And our future will
become the empire,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.384 align:middle line:90%
if we don't abort this now.

00:14:55.384 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
we've been seeing obviously,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the constant desire
to militarize space,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.555 align:middle line:90%
the secret space program.

00:15:00.555 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So that's
really, it seemed to me,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
the Cabal's ambition
ultimately, right,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
is to basically transform us
into mechanized, roboticized

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.879 align:middle line:84%
slaves essentially in
this galactic empire.

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Was what you had assessed
from the insiders

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
as far as the Cabal's
plan for Earth?

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely say
that, as people who've

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
watched "Cosmic Disclosure"
on this network already know,

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
there is an artificial
intelligence.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It's very ancient,
and it is ultimately

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:90%
controlling the Cabal.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And its goal appears
to be what they're

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:90%
calling now the singularity.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Recently, a friend of a friend,
a female friend this is now,

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
was at a conference
and met this man who

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
refused to give her his name.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
He said that he had been
an advisor to Bill Gates

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
at a very high level
for many years.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And the only name
he would give was

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Jack Out of the Box, which is
a kind of interesting twist.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And he directed her
to a website that he

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
said he was responsible in part
for financing and directing

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.614 align:middle line:90%
called 2045.com.

00:16:04.614 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You go to 2045.com,
you read this article

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
in which they're talking to the
Dalai Lama about their project.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama
appears to be backing

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
this idea for an incremental
plan where, by the time

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:84%
we get to 2045,
your consciousness

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
is completely uploaded
into machines,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and you don't even require or
need a physical body at all.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
You've totally transferred
over to a completely AI system

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:90%
in which we are in the matrix.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
You look at "Star Wars,"
what George Lucas is doing,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:90%
what is Darth Vader?

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Darth Vader is only a
little bit human left.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
He's got mechanical
arms and legs.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't even take his
helmet off without him dying.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And the body inside is
actually very decrepit,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's breathing because
it's on life support.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So we also see death
stars in "Star Wars."

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is very fascinating
because, as I revealed

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
in "Ascension Mysteries"
with photographs and lots

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of testimony from many
insiders, we already

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
have death stars in
our solar system.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
He says "A long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away."

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
Well, the "long time
ago" part is right,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
but the "galaxy" part is
actually not far away.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So it does appear, for
example, that the C3PO robot

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, according to
what my insiders have told me,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
they found hundreds of
thousands of those things

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
all rusted out and
no longer functional

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.570 align:middle line:90%
all over our solar system.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
They look just like C3PO.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's totally based
on the real design.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.339 align:middle line:84%
Even the newest
"Star Wars" movie

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
premiere in December,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
once again, the death
star is a central focus.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
They keep coming back
to that same theme,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
of planet-killing moon.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's a warning of our
future, but it's also

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.915 align:middle line:90%
an advisory about our past.

00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:51.539 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What are the
death stars you're

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:90%
referring to in our galaxy?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.935 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: In
our solar system--

00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:55.101 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: In our solar system.

00:17:55.101 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: --we
actually have stars--

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
we have moons that have
weapons-grade systems in them

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that are strong enough that they
could destroy a whole planet,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.884 align:middle line:84%
and that technology
is very ancient.

00:18:07.884 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And according to what Corey
Goode has disclosed on "Cosmic

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure," those
were originally used

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
to protect us from
foreign invaders,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.592 align:middle line:84%
we being part of a
little enclave of stars.

00:18:19.592 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is all in
"Ascension Mysteries."

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.147 align:middle line:84%
We are right next to
a big giant stargate.

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
There is, in fact,
and I talk about it

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in the book, a huge
plasma chimney that's

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
right next to our solar
system, this big tube.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And the insiders all tell us
those are actual wormholes.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You see the plasma
around the wormhole.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.324 align:middle line:90%
It's not invisible.

00:18:42.324 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But you can go in there, and
you can travel, in this case,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
to another galaxy.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So our little part of
our galaxy is actually

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
a very highly desirable zone
because there's not very

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:90%
many of these galactic portals.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So we were very
vulnerable to invasion.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So literally billions
of years ago,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
our star and many other
stars in the neighborhood

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
were outfitted with
these defense systems

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
to prevent these foreign
invaders from coming in.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And it worked fine
up until the events

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that George Lucas describes
in "Star Wars" took

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
place, where we had a huge
super-Earth, that's now

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:84%
the asteroid belt,
blow themselves

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
up by having hacked one of these
moons and using it as a weapon.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Their enemies were being
attacked by these moons,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:90%
and it got turned against them.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So since that
super-Earth blew up,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the whole protective grid system
that we had in our star cluster

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:90%
went down.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've had this
massive influx

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials that may or
may not be people that we want.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.349 align:middle line:84%
This would include the
genetic farmers, the people

00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:90%
that would tinker with our DNA.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
This includes the
Draco reptilians.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So the last half-million years
has been really rough for us.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like events
are taking place now

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that are finally going to
clean all that up for us.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.875 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So would Lucifer have
been one of those aliens that

00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:02.675 align:middle line:90%
came through?

00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Was that the idea, that Lucifer
was actually an alien being?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: The story of
Lucifer's very complex

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:90%
and multifaceted.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
It does appear-- and
it's interesting, again,

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.226 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting into
stuff that's right in the book

00:20:15.226 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:84%
here-- one of the
aspects of Lucifer

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
is the survivors of that
super-Earth who actually

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
eventually crash-landed
on Earth after they'd

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
been defeated again when
they were living on the moon.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.814 align:middle line:84%
And when they had
no place left to go,

00:20:29.814 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
even though they knew
that the Earth was

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Draco-inhabited territory, and
it was very dangerous for them,

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:90%
they crash-landed on Earth.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
They had no choice.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
They had elongated skulls.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
They or their children,
but most likely they,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
were giants originally.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So we find documented
records of giant

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
skeletons all over the planet,
and they had elongated skulls.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Those people appeared to have
gotten here 55,000 years ago

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and set up kingdoms
all over the planet.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
They were wiped out 50,000
years ago, 25,000 years ago,

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and, again, about 12,000 years
ago, the fall of Atlantis.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's been three
major catastrophes.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing about the
Luciferian force, it's like--

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and they use this
in the Illuminati,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.685 align:middle line:90%
the analogy to the phoenix.

00:21:14.685 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:90%
You see it all the time.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Like look at the
"Hunger Games," right?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.295 align:middle line:84%
And the character
that the lead female

00:21:21.295 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is playing, it's all
about the phoenix,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
the bird of fire, right?

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
She even has her costume
turn into the bird of fire.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:90%
But she's also Katniss, the cat.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know the book talks
about the feline cat people

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that we see with the
Sphinx, for example.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I've seen
them in a certain journey,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:90%
so I believe that's real.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.076 align:middle line:84%
And they seem very
benevolent creators of-- they

00:21:43.076 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
told me that they were the
builder race, basically,

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
who helped build a
lot of the monuments

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and temples around the Earth.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So would you say that
they were perhaps

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:84%
one of our progenitor races
that basically tried to help--

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: That is
really interesting that--

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.678 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: --you're associating
feline-looking beings with

00:21:56.678 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:90%
the progenitor race.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
book I do describe

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that there has been,
by some of the groups

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
in these secret programs,
research suggesting

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that this so-called
ancient builder race,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the oldest buildings
were made by people

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
who had a feline,
human-looking appearance.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And we see that, for example,
in the Roman cult of Mithraism

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that's the precursor to Masonry
in which their big savior

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
figure is the leontocephalus,
the lion-headed man, that

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:90%
represents the sun.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the phoenix seems to
represent how the group knows

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that they have to be burned
down, seemingly defeated,

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
but that they rise
from the ashes again.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:84%
They always seem to come
back just by a little margin.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, when we're talking
about what Lucifer is,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
we're also getting into a
very, very important point that

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:56.150 align:middle line:84%
is their cabal beliefs about the
story of Genesis in the Bible

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Garden of Eden in which
Eve has a child with Adam,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
but also has a
child with Lucifer.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer's child
is Cain, and so there

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is a huge belief
within the Cabal

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that they are the
bloodline of Cain.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, I thought it was
Lilith had the baby with Adam.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But either way, the idea is
it comes from a demonic seed.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Right.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.268 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Different seed.

00:23:19.268 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: So yeah, there
is another interpretation,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
which is Adam has sex with
Lilith, and they have a child.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But what I've been hearing
from these insiders

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:34.351 align:middle line:84%
is that Howard Hughes,
the aircraft tycoon, he

00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:84%
was basically part of the early
military-industrial complex,

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.525 align:middle line:90%
but he was not Cabal.

00:23:38.525 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And he starts to figure out
that weird stuff is going on.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
He hires these high-class
female prostitutes

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to extract information
from Cabal members

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
while they're having sex and
under the influence of drugs.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And that from that
cache of intel,

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
he determined that
these people believe

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that they are the bloodline
descendants of Cain,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that they are actually
Lucifer's family.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
They see Lucifer as
a flesh-and-blood

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial being
that fell to the Earth.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.269 align:middle line:84%
And that that's where all
the good ET stuff comes from,

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's where all the good
ancient mystery teachings

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:90%
come from.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all Lucifer.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, Lucifer
is actually not bad.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:90%
He's the good guy.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And this other god
that they think

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is evil that they
call [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for trying to
steer us away from Lucifer,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:90%
which they think is good.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It's very bizarre.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And [INAUDIBLE] would
be what species of alien?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Or human-looking?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: They never really--
I don't know if they get

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But definitely they believe that
the Elohim, these benevolent

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
ETs that we would
call benevolent

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that were responsible
for such things

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
as the destruction of Atlantis
and previous civilizations

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
before them, that that's
evil, that those are

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.909 align:middle line:84%
the bad guys, that
they're trying

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to wipe out the good
guys, which they

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
see as the seed of Lucifer.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
Russell Crowe remake

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of "Noah" in which the whole
bloodline of Cain's story

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
is told throughout
the whole thing.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And Noah himself wraps the
snake skin around his hand,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's how he
gets the power is

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:84%
by touching his son
with the finger that

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
has the serpent from the
Garden of Eden on his finger.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's supposedly Noah.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very bizarre.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.439 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
Christians watched "Noah"

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and were like, what
the heck is this?

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: But it's
all so-called gnostic.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, how do we not get
confused in this cosmos, where

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
we have cat-like beings,
bird-like beings, Draco

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%
reptilians, the
Luciferians, who, I guess,

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:90%
are more human-looking, right?

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Yeah.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But all
these various beings,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.719 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can people
not get confused as

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to know who is the good guy?

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you know you're
worshipping the good god

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.136 align:middle line:84%
and not the bad god
in such a situation?

00:25:47.136 --> 00:25:50.409 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's
just so cluttered.

00:25:50.409 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: I think
that, ultimately,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of clarity
that we can bring to this.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And the clarity comes from
the fact that there is a god,

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
or there is an intelligent
universal mind, if you will,

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%
that is the builder of reality.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And that universal
mind is identifiable

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:90%
by its characteristics.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The characteristics
of the universal mind

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
are the characteristics
that we hear

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
about any time you're dealing
with an ascended master.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So you could be looking at
Buddha or Krishna or Jesus.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And look at what people
think about Jesus,

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the kindness and the
compassion and the forgiveness.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Tibetan teachings
on rainbow body and,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
what do you have to
do to actually ascend?

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And they want you to have every
thought be a loving thought.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the consistency,
the thread of the positive,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
is in loving, forgiveness,
all these kinds of qualities.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
then have to look at,

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is a particular
group or being trying

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to steer us towards being more
forgiving, more loving, more

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.022 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, or towards
manipulation, control, deceit,

00:27:00.022 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:84%
lies, trickery,
that kind of stuff?

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Know them by their action--
by their deeds as opposed

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to what they say.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, well,
Lucifer is the kind god.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But if then you go and
you sacrifice a child

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:84%
or have blood sacrifice and
wars, and pointless wars,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
not for defense, but
just purely for bloodshed

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and worship of some
god, that's obviously

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:90%
not a benevolent being.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.479 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what
you're getting at,

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:25.353 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is that's
how we can distinguish

00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:27.850 align:middle line:84%
between those beings that are
here really for benevolence

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.322 align:middle line:84%
to try to enlighten us and help
our consciousness expand as

00:27:30.322 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
opposed to those who are
working with the Cabal

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to maintain their
galactic control

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately put us into
these new roboticized bodies,

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:90%
right, towards total control.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: If you also think
about, why are there rules?

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you find out, you

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
talk to people in
the Illuminati,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we'll just use
that term for now,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
these Illuminati people
who I've spoken to,

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
whistle-blowers trying to break
out of it, some cases still in,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
some cases they got out, one of
the things they keep telling me

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:90%
is there are rules.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't just do
whatever you want.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They have to work
within these rules

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to get their
objectives realized.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And the rules include
that they have

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what they're
doing out in the open.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The first guy who
really pioneered this

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:84%
was Queen Elizabeth's
astrologer, John Dee.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And so he's the original 007.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:90%
He's the original James Bond.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And what he was able to
do was to figure out,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to rework ancient rituals,
where they literally

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
are making magical
circles invoking

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:84%
these negative entities and then
trying to bid and contract them

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to do what they want.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the rules do stipulate
that if you do it right,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:84%
you can make these negative
entities serve you.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: So they have
learned how to do that,

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and so they worship these
ceremonies and rituals.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, why
do the rules exist?

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, the rules
ultimately do suggest

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have a
benevolent universe,

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
because their own defeat
is built into the equation.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They have had to, step by
step, reveal their agenda over

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and over again, in movies,
even in the symbol they

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
put on the back of
the US dollar bill.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:90%
They're showing you what it is.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.055 align:middle line:84%
They're telling you
what they're doing.

00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:90%
They can't hide.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
They're just coming right
out with it in the open,

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and that makes it very,
very difficult to try to put

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
the genie back in the bottle.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think you mentioned
that their defeat is

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
built into the
universe, but it's also

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
part of our own process.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
You talk about in the book,
the dark night of the soul.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
That basically, in order
to come to the light,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to come to goodness,
we have to be tested.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.368 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through certain
challenges and certain things

00:29:39.368 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that can feel like they
can destroy us and kill us,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
but actually,
ultimately, bring us

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:90%
through the dawn of the new day.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps a lot of these things
that we call evil are really

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:84%
just challenges that we have to
face for our own consciousness

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.412 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:29:53.412 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WILCOCK: If you look at the
story of Jesus as if it was

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:84%
an archetype of
the hero's journey,

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's what Joseph
Campbell argued,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
then part of the hero's journey
is this dark night of the soul,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or what happened to Jesus,
which is the crucifixion.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That crucifixion
metaphor, of course,

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
also iterates into
every Hollywood film.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The hero's journey, as you
know with your background

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.494 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood, and
I have one too,

00:30:18.494 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:84%
they don't ever
call it a formula.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
If you call it a formula,
they get really mad.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's called structure.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And the structure is so specific
that you have to actually

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
have certain story points
happen at certain page

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:90%
numbers in a 120-page script.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.976 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have that,
then the script readers

00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:35.350 align:middle line:84%
will never even
allow your script

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to make it into the
hands of a director.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why we
resonate with this structure

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.800 align:middle line:84%
is it's the story of the
galactic consciousness.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of what
we all go through.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the villain is built
into the hero's journey.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:84%
The villain is part of the
design of how we awaken.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The villain is-- essentially,
if you look at screenwriting

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to write a villain,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.695 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to write the
villain as the funhouse mirror

00:31:02.695 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:90%
inversion of the hero's flaws.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
If you took the
hero's flaws and let

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that hero grow
into what he would

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:84%
become if his flaws
were not conquered,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that's what the villain is.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So then we actually
see that the hero

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:84%
has to face off
against the villain

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and overcome his
own flaws in order

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:90%
to achieve the transcension.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the villain
himself is a projection of us.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
the Cabal on Earth

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:84%
is a holographic mirror
that's being held up

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.542 align:middle line:84%
to us collectively to
say, here's what you are.

00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I think that's
a perfect way to put it.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me today, David.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.602 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Thank you, Sean.

00:31:38.602 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:90%
This has been awesome.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: We could go
on for hours, I know.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll have to get you back soon.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: All right.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.018 align:middle line:90%
Well, fist bump, buddy.

00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: There you go.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.569 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your time.

00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> WILCOCK: Thanks, man.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there
you have it, folks.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.236 align:middle line:84%
Great insights
from David Wilcock.

00:31:50.236 --> 00:31:51.796 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree
with or believe

00:31:51.796 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:90%
everything said here today.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.336 align:middle line:84%
But I really urge
you to check out

00:31:54.336 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
his website, divinecosmos.com,
and several of his shows

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.646 align:middle line:90%
here on Gaia.

00:31:58.646 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget to pick up
his latest book, "Ascension

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Mysteries."

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.469 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:32:05.469 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.635 align:middle line:90%
