>>SEAN: Welcome
to Buzzsaw, where

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.795 align:middle line:84%
we cut through the
mainstream narrative

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:90%
to explore the hidden truths.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
is Richard Beaumont.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
He found and ran Kindred
Spirit magazine for 20 years.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:10%
Richard is also a student of the
founder of Human Design, Ra Uru

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:10%

Today he helps us understand
our own human design.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So people might
hear "human design,"

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.915 align:middle line:84%
they think some
kind of robotics.

>>SEAN: Tell us
what human design is

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and also the origin
story, because it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
quite interesting about how
Ra came to this teaching while

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%
on a visa, as I understand it.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD: A lot of truths
come through revelation.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It was a big shock to Ra when
this information downloaded.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
The complexity of
it is astonishing.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it takes
at least 10 years

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to learn the different
sides of human design.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's a huge science.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So Ra got a direct download
for eight days, eight nights.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.558 align:middle line:84%
He said it was the greatest
experience of his life,

00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and he was very
depressed afterwards,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
because the world was
mundane once more.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's information.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And human design is
something that enables people

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:90%
to know precisely who they are.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We're all patterns
in a larger program.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderful thing about
it is that it's verifiable.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So I can look at
a chart, and I can

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
speak to the person
who has that chart,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and they will
recognize themselves

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
at a deep level in a way that
no one else can recognize them.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We are who we are, and
we have this picture

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, depending on
what people have said to us,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:90%
what our experiences are.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
get to the blueprint.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Human
Design gives you.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.047 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what
is the difference?

00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Because many people, for
example, know about astrology,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.037 align:middle line:84%
and there are obviously
different degrees of study

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to astrology
beyond picking up

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
your horoscope at
the magazine stand

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "Oh, I'm a
Capricorn, and so what's my--

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I should look out for
my love today," right?

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
human design goes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to a level even
deeper than astrology,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.605 align:middle line:90%
if I understand that.

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So explain what that
difference would be.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We have-- it's
a synthesis of genetics

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:90%
and hexagrams from the I-Ching.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Astrology gives
us our placement.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We need the birth time
to be able to do a chart.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:90%
But it can tell us so much more.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It can tell us about the correct
environment for someone's body.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It can tell us the
motivation of the mind.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It can tell us how you function.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
There are four different
types of human being,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:84%
just as there are four
different types of blood.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you know your
type, and if you know

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
how you can make a correct
decision and stay with that--

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of an internal
authority that most of us

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:90%
have--

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:90%
life becomes very different.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You then start walking
along your life.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.978 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Well, the four--

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's not
just information.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: The four humors, the
four different types of people

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of the four
humors of a lot of the older

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.685 align:middle line:90%
alchemical studies.

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.407 align:middle line:84%
There's sanguine, phlegmatic,
this type of thing.

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that what the four types are?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
What are the four
types of personality?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's
really about the aura.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So 75-- 70% of us
are Generators.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we have an
open and enveloping aura.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we walk around, we kind
of overlap with other people,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and we take in what they
have that we don't have.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:90%
We take it in as conditioning.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Projectors have a focused
and absorbing aura,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
so they can really go
directly into people,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.595 align:middle line:90%
and they're very good as guides.

00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:11.113 align:middle line:84%
So the Generators
are the workers.

00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
If you like, the
Generators are the ones

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that can get a lot done, because
they've got the power to do it.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You've got-- the founder of
Human Design was a Manifester.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.777 align:middle line:84%
Also an energy type, but
can't keep on putting out

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
the energy and work.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Manifesters are very specific.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- there's
about 9% of those.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a close
and repelling aura.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
Reflectors, which

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:90%
have a kind of a nonstick aura.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:90%
They're completely open.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
There isn't any fixed
life force in them.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they're
not here to attach.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to take in
conditioning continually.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So they have an ability to
really know what is going on,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.353 align:middle line:90%
if they're correct.

00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And then there's
also the four personalities

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
or there's four dominant cycles
in a human's life, right,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
which does seem to me to
correlate to a certain extent

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to Vedic astrology.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The idea is there's a solar
return, Saturn return, Uranus

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
opposition, and Chiron return?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yes,
we can do a chart

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
for what we call the weather.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at
the solar return,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
which would be every year.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:90%
What's the weather coming?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to meet
as a conditioning field

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:90%
in the background energy field?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at the
largest cycles, such as Saturn

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
return, this is something that
sets you up in a different way.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand the
patterning from the Saturn

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
return, and you're
in that period,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
it can help you immensely
living your life correctly.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So for some people,
Saturn return and Chiron

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
return are really important,
I mean more so than most.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
So again, there are differences.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
This is not astrology.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a synthesis of all
this information, which is

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:90%
both scientific and mystical.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
But yes, the cycles can be seen.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because Human
Design is predicated

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
on the notion of someone's
birthdate and time, is it

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
essentially, as with
astrology, figuring out

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
which planets would influence
different aspects of a person's

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
life, or even down
to their organs?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of the more
ancient Hermetic schools

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and astrology schools would look
at the influence, for example,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.663 align:middle line:84%
of the stars on
different organs,

00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
or the different planets
have different relationship

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to different organs
in someone's body.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So does that have a place
within Human Design?

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yes, you can look
at the astrological matrix

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
in a chart and look
at it that way.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But for us, there are nine
centers, potential centers,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
in a human being.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So some of those centers have
a biological correspondence.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:10%
So for example, the G center,
the center of identity,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:10%
has a direct
correspondence with liver.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:10%
If you look at
the will, the will

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:10%
has four different
aspects to it,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:10%
and you've got the thymus
and the heart muscle

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:10%
and the gall bladder
and the stomach.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:10%
So it's not astrology, and
you can see very clearly

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:10%
in a chart what the
issues are going

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:10%
to be physically
for someone if they

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:10%
have one of these
centers whiten the chart.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
This is when they're going to
probably, if they're not aware,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
they're going to run
into problems eventually.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do you
ultimately take it

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
as such-- you say
the human design

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
as though it's programmed.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you take this as intimating
that there is no free choice?

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.115 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, we are
simply destined by our design?

00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:58.282 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We are like
patterns in a program, that's

00:07:58.282 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:90%
the way I look at it.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And the program is a
consciousness expansion

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And unlike astrology, where
you're looking at birthdate

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
only, we're looking at
two different dates, two

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
calculations, one
for the personality

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and one for the body.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the body is what's
in red in the chart,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and the personality
is what's in black.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
you've got an ability

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
this arranged marriage

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
is that you're trying to live.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
If you make correct decisions,
then you get to live your life.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
You get to actually live
it, and what you meet

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what you're
designed to meet.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
If you don't make
correct decisions-- oh!

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:90%
No point talking about--

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you're going to live
life at a level that

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to be fulfilling
or satisfying for you.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll still live, but the
destiny that you could have had

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and the growth in consciousness
you could have had,

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.633 align:middle line:90%
it ain't gonna happen.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: A lot of the
spiritual teachings

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.045 align:middle line:84%
talk about this notion
that if you do not

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
make the right decisions,
and essentially you

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
try to suppress things
or ignore things,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that comes to us
ultimately through tragedy.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Basically, a tragic
event, a traumatic event,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:84%
a chaotic event
ultimately occurs

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.312 align:middle line:84%
to rectify that which
you have ignored, right?

00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what it reminds me of.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But now, the way you describe
the system and the program,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of "The
Matrix," in a sense.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: [LAUGHING] Yes.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.325 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And some
people are now looking

00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
at this notion of
the entire universe

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
being essentially an
artificial intelligence

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:84%
simulation, some kind
of computer simulation.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you think Human Design
speaks to that concept,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that this is all a simulation,
that it really is programmatic,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that it could be the design of
a super-intelligent computer?

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: For us, this is
the mechanics of the Maya.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the science
of differentiation,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
showing each
person's uniqueness.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It's also the
science of awakening.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a possibility to wake
up to who you are and live it.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.915 align:middle line:84%
If we-- and that's
not in the program.

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we do see
it's a program,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:84%
we do see it's a program
to expand consciousness,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of the
Maya, it's limited.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
The universe has a certain size.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
experiments they've done,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
they've got the
edges of the universe

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:90%
are older than the universe.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make
sense, unless you

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
realize that it's like being in
a womb and we're all connected.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's through
neutrinos that

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
can go through matter
and dark matter.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a communication
happening.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:90%
In that sense, we're all one.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not realizing
it, but there

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is this communication going on
through neutrinos all the time.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This would be-- so
it's a single entity.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The program is a single
entity, and we're

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.593 align:middle line:84%
about 2 and 1/2 months
in its birth cycle,

00:10:57.593 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
which is why no one knows
what the hell is going on.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 2 and 1/2
months as an embryo,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to know--

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You're saying humans
are 2 and 1/2 months in, or all

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:90%
of life in the universe?

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: All the
consciousness program.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Humans are part of it.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:90%
We're not the biggest part.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
The biggest biomass is insects.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all consciousness.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
For us, we have
this understanding

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that there's crystals
of consciousness

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
for both the personality
and the body,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.598 align:middle line:84%
and if you could see them, if
you could see the crystals,

00:11:31.598 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't see anything else.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It would just be so many.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a vast consciousness
network going on all the time.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.198 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we see it.

00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because I think a lot
of our audience, when you speak

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
about Human Design, they would
have no way of grasping it,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we wanted to do
a session with me, where

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
you can show my chart and
give an analysis so people

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
can better visualize what
you're speaking about.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Sure.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.147 align:middle line:90%
Should we do that now?

00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
So what are we looking at here?

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, this
is the rave mandala.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:10%
And here we have all
the hexagrams going

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:10%
around this amazing wheel.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:10%
And if we look at
it as a chart--

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:10%
so these are all hexagrams
and lines of hexagrams.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Whatever's in red
is unconscious.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:10%
You're not aware of it
until it comes out of you.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:10%
For example, your critical
awareness is there.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You'll find spelling mistakes
in anything you read.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like, that's not right.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can't help
but see the mistakes.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
very valuable for people,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
if they want to
get things right,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
to have your awareness there.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know
you've got it.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't help but see it.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's the 18th gate here.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:10%
When we're looking
at the black, this

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:10%
is the personality crystal.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:10%
This is what's conscious in you.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:10%
This is what you're
always aware of.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:10%
So for example, there's a
certain adventurism in you,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:10%
in terms of life has
going to be worthwhile.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
You're prepared
to try things out

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
until you find something
that's really worthwhile.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's here in adventurism
in the 28th hexagram, line

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:90%
three.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
start with is the type,

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:90%
because there are four types.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And knowing your
type is really key.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's key and it's simple.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:90%
You're a generator.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
That's because you have
this red square here.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:10%
So you generate energy.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:10%
You go to bed when
you're exhausted

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:10%
would be the best
way, and then you

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:10%
wake up revived in the morning,
ready to go on and do it

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:10%
all again.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Very true.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.247 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: We keep on going.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:90%
We've got a sacral.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:90%
We can keep on keeping on.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we enter into something
that's correct for us,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
then we can last.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:10%
So for example, this
sacral center here,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:10%
this is for you to be
focused and concentrated.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the small details.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.863 align:middle line:84%
It's the intensity that you
have in you all the time.

00:13:55.863 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You may not know
you've got it, but it's

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
part of who you are to
have that intensity in you.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And the small details matter.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You've also got this
14th gate, which

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
is about empowering
a unique vision.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
If you see something creative,
an artist you may like

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
or something that
really attracts you,

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
you want to encourage them
and give them juice for that.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And here on the fifth gate, you
have-- this is about timing.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
This is about your
ability to tune

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.093 align:middle line:84%
into the flow, the pattern of
timing that's right for you.

00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to work
on anyone else's timing.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: [CHUCKLING]

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I mean, you know,
no matter what happens--

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I thought it was
because I was a Capricorn I

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:90%
was very stubborn.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, you've got part
of-- you're not fully stubborn.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.928 align:middle line:84%
You've got part of the
channel of stubbornness,

00:14:49.928 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:90%
but not the full thing.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
You're more defiant
than stubborn,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and that comes with this
aspect here, the 1,8 channel.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:90%
This is a life force that says--

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like the Frank
Sinatra song, you know?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:90%
"I did it my way."

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: That's the
Trump song, too.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Is it?

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: At his inaugural
ball, that was his song.

00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We will
have a look at Trump

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and see later to
see if that's right.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:90%
But for you, it's right.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go your own way.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
go anyone else's way.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.177 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But the left
side is very colorful, so

00:15:18.177 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
this is the root.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:10%
This is the adrenal energy
here in the brown square,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:10%
the adrenal energy, the
pressure to want to improve

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:10%
and to build up solutions that
can be useful for everyone.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's a side of you that
really wants to perfect things

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:90%
and improve things.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And here in the--

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:90%
this is the intuition.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
This is quite a
strong immune system.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So if people had this
open, they wouldn't

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:90%
have a strong immune system.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The physical consequences
of how you're designed

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
are very important.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Over here
in the head center--

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: I have an empty head.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: You
have an empty head.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: [LAUGHING]

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.205 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So you
don't have-- yes, you

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:90%
don't have a fixed idea.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not here to be
certain intellectually.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You're here to be
intellectual, because you're

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.340 align:middle line:84%
filtering all the ideas
that come to you to see

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:90%
if they're worthwhile or not.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And this is
something that you do here.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a
mystical side to it.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
You have an interest
in the mystical side,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
because occult knowledge
is here in the 61st gate

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
in the first line as
part of your Jupiter.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a side of you
that wants to know more

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
about occult knowledge.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.558 align:middle line:84%
And you can end up
getting lost if you--

00:16:37.558 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Oh, I've
been down that road.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:39.543 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:16:39.543 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I bet you have.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.388 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So how would my
chart compare to Trump?

00:16:42.388 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:90%
You talk about willful people.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure--

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Let's
have a look at Trump.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I'm sure he would
be-- on the right side,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
would be very
flush on it, right?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.033 align:middle line:90%
With him.

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And then
just one last thing.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:90%
You have a--

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The costume that you wear is
that of what we call a 5,2.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's a kind of
seductive side.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It's also a side
where you actually

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.152 align:middle line:84%
like to be in your own,
away from people sometimes.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of a hermit side,
too, that goes, "Wait a minute,

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.349 align:middle line:84%
enough of the world, we're
going to close the door.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:90%
That's it."

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:90%
If we look at Trump--

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%
and you're transpersonal.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.370 align:middle line:90%
You're more aware of people.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Trump isn't.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Trump's a 1,3.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
You can see-- so Trump is
going to be self-absorbed.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:10%
So he's got an
emotional system that

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:10%
gives him this
ability to penetrate

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:10%
any auras in terms of intimacy.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:10%
So from his point of
view, he doesn't know why,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:10%
but he can get
through to people.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:10%
And people that know
him and are around him

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:10%
can't help but to
be penetrated by him

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:10%
in terms of feeling
that they've already

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:10%
got a connection with him.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.343 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why.

00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.143 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:90%
There's a warmth.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: There's a warmth.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is the warm side.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So he has got this
warm side to him.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's emotionally--
this aspect

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%
would be, it's us or them.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like very much for America.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:84%
"America is what I stand
for, and then there's

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the world."

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
tribal quality here.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But also, like
George W. Bush, he's

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
got the channel
of transitoriness.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.955 align:middle line:84%
So one, we know that
he loves to travel.

00:18:17.955 --> 00:18:19.705 align:middle line:84%
Two, he knows he's
going to bring crisis--

00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: [CHUCKLING]

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.217 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: --because
crisis always

00:18:22.217 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
comes when you go
into something you

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.543 align:middle line:84%
haven't done before
for progress and it

00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
doesn't turn out the way you
think it's going to turn out.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So he's got this-- he's a
manifesting generator, which

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
means he can often hurry into
things and it's not correct.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
He should be taking his time and
feeding into the emotional wave

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
to see how he really
feels about something.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.015 align:middle line:84%
But as a not-self, as
someone lost in his life,

00:18:44.015 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
he's going to make
immediate decisions,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.663 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
going to be good.

00:18:48.663 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I'm sure Trump would
be quite opposite from Obama,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And he's
willful, by the way.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
He's also materialistic
and willful,

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and he's got his
own fixed ideas.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He's going
to disagree with you

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
if you disagree with him.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:84%
With Barack Obama,
Obama is a projector.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:10%
He only has one life force.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:10%
This is the life force
that can make people really

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:10%
feel strongly about something.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So he's a fantastic
election candidate.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:90%
The new way, the better way.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
He can really make you feel
it's going to be a better way.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But to be President, it's
going to very much depend

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:90%
on who's around him.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the only
life force that he has.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: I see.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: So it depended on--

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.063 align:middle line:84%
and it was a whole new
stage for him at this time.

00:19:36.063 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: It looks to me--
obviously, it's very empty,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:10%
and I think many people came
understand that Obama really

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:10%
was this empty vessel that
people projected-- well, he

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:10%
projected a certain vision,
they bought into the vision,

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:10%
and then there was no one
really behind the campaigner.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
He has no fixed identity
any more than Trump does.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: The single life
force being the root chakra.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I see that
obviously with Obama.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:10%
I see it in my own chart.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.805 align:middle line:84%
And how powerful is
this sacral life force?

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Because many people who
understand Kundalini,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the base chakra,
that this is basically

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
where we began our
journey is basically

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
from the sacral place,
from that base up.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to basically
activate this base

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and work from there
using our sexual energy

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
for creative endeavors, right?

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.560 align:middle line:84%
As creators, as generators, as
motivators-- it begins there,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:90%
no?

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The thing about the
chakras is that we've changed.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Since 1781, things have changed.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Human beings have changed.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't a
direct correlation

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to the chakras in
our current design.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
To have a sacral isn't--

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:90%
this is sexual availability.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
There is sexual
availability here.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.185 align:middle line:84%
With Donald Trump,
also, intimacy

00:20:54.185 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
is an important
part of his life.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
With Barack Obama, he
can be over-available,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
because he has this open.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So we're all different.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.818 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to be able to see
the difference in someone

00:21:05.818 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to understand
them and accept them.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the joy of Human Design.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a science that
you can verify.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.058 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you would say that
we cannot change our design.

00:21:15.058 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:90%
There is no way we could.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
But can we change our destiny?

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, everyone
has a potential path

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:90%
they can walk down.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in the
nodes of the moon.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So we can see the quality
of the environment

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be living in.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, to-- when you talk about
destiny, yes, there is--

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
we can say quite a
lot about destiny.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
As I said, you're
here to make demands

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
on people that want
things from you.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you're
here to bring transformation.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
relationships, it's

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
not about building
something for civilization.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not about mental--

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling yourself
through the mind.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about transformation.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And so if we put that
information with your chart,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:84%
we can say more
about the destiny.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You're here to bring solutions.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
You have a genius for
solutions that you may not even

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:90%
know you've got.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:90%
It's unconscious in you.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But you're here-- when
we look at the journey

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
through your life in the cycles
that you mentioned earlier on,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the Saturn, the Uranus
opposition, and the Chiron,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
we can see a movement of how
your life is going to be.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not fixed in terms
of you will have this.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.705 align:middle line:90%
It depends who you meet.

00:22:40.705 --> 00:22:41.505 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:22:41.505 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But so at the end of the day,
though, what you would argue

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is that there ultimately is a
background that is inevitable.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
situations that you

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to deal with
and face, and it's up to you,

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
obviously, to decide how you
can maximize your potential,

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:90%
you can minimize your potential.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
But inevitably, you
will face certain things

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
in the course of your life,
based on your destiny.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's like-- you
need to respond because you're

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
a Generator, so when
someone comes towards you,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and they say, "Do
you want to do this?"

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:90%
They ask you a question.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And you go, "Hmm."

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:84%
This energy goes out to
really want to do it.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Energy goes out
towards something.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
That's for you.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:90%
In that moment, that's for you.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
If you don't go
"hmm" and you go,

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
"Uh, OK," it means you're
going against your own nature

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: I see.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So you can know
from your inner authority--

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:84%
most people have
an inner authority.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.973 align:middle line:84%
They can know how to
make correct decisions.

00:23:38.973 --> 00:23:41.802 align:middle line:84%
And this is the practical
side of Human Design.

00:23:41.802 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
If they make the
correct decisions,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have a life
lived at a much higher level.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.873 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the
day, Human Design

00:23:47.873 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is important to help
each of us understand

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:90%
our own unique nature.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Absolutely.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: Well, Human Design
is infinitely fascinating.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:10%
I wish we had time to go into
all the aspects of studying

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:10%
basically our past
as well as our future

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.160 align:middle line:10%
and certain predictions.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.993 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes, yes.

00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But for
now, I think this

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.502 align:middle line:84%
has been a tremendous
insight, and I really

00:24:08.502 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
hope that people have
learned from this teaching

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
to basically, A, decipher
these drawings which

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
are so illusory
and so complicated,

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
but now I also understand why
it takes 10 years of study

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.247 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to
read one of these charts.

00:24:22.247 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yes, if you're
going to do it properly.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.455 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are getting
little bits and pieces,

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:28.298 align:middle line:10%
and then there's a kind of a--

00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:10%
people doing Human
Design that don't really

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:10%
know what they're doing.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So you need to go to
the real professionals.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.523 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's just going
to be mind talk and no idea.

00:24:36.523 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be real.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, there
is a science to it.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Definitely.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Thank you so much for
joining me today, Richard.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: My pleasure, Sean.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I really
appreciate your time.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Thank you.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there
you have it, folks.

00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Richard Beaumont.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything he said here

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.617 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge
you to check out

his site, humandesign.info, for
his work and more information.

with "Gaia TV" in
the subject line.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
along the buzzsaw's edge, and it
requires constant reassessment.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.412 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.
