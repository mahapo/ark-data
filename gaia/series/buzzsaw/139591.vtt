Is it time to get high
in Trump's America?

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:04.046 align:middle line:90%
That's into the Buzzsaw.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.936 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN STONE:
Welcome to "Buzzsaw,"

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.271 align:middle line:84%
where we cut through the
mainstream narrative to explore

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.356 align:middle line:90%
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.815 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.234 align:middle line:10%
And with me today
is David Seaman,

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.694 align:middle line:10%
who is a reporter and former
contributor to Huffington

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.446 align:middle line:10%
Post and Business Insider.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.406 align:middle line:10%
He also has his own YouTube
channel, DavidSeamanOnline,

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:35.244 align:middle line:10%
and today he gives us some
insight into his research.

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:37.329 align:middle line:84%
So I actually want to
start by asking you--

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.706 align:middle line:84%
because online it's
very scandalous,

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.833 align:middle line:84%
the fact that Huffington
Post basically cut you off

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
as a contributor,
as I understand it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.046 align:middle line:84%
because you were questioning
Hillary Clinton's health

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.422 align:middle line:90%
issues before the election.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.258 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID SEAMAN: Yeah,
Sean, that's correct.

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.426 align:middle line:10%
I had a contributorship
there, and they cut off

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:54.513 align:middle line:10%
my access and my
contributorship shortly

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:56.807 align:middle line:10%
after a story about her
alleged health problems

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:10%
hit their home page, because
they have a trending component,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.229 align:middle line:10%
and the top stories
rank right there

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.105 align:middle line:10%
on the front page
of Huffington Post.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Mine was the top story
in the overnight.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.403 align:middle line:84%
When somebody woke up in the
morning, they didn't like that,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.364 align:middle line:84%
and that was the end of my
Huffington Post chapter.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.783 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So, needless to
say that Huffington Post was

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.577 align:middle line:84%
basically biased in
terms of their stand.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:18.578 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: I believe so.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.997 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was biased.

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:21.914 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't even
really using my column

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:90%
to promote political ideology.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly stuff about
cryptocurrency and gold

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.714 align:middle line:90%
ownership, Bitcoin.

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:30.549 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
this viral video

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.343 align:middle line:84%
that Paul Watson had
put out about the claims

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.513 align:middle line:84%
about her health being much
poorer than people thought,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.432 align:middle line:90%
and I just linked to that.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And on the basis of
that, I was removed.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.435 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.811 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
it more later,

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.564 align:middle line:84%
but I certainly think it's
indicative to me of the idea

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.692 align:middle line:84%
that the fake news is not
really just in the alt media.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.985 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there are fake news
stories going through the alt

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.113 align:middle line:84%
media, but it's also the
mainstream media, I think,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.324 align:middle line:90%
that has not only--

00:01:55.324 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a phoniness
to it, there's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.661 align:middle line:84%
also just an overall suspicion
I think that people have,

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.123 align:middle line:84%
and rightfully so, of their
mainstream news sources because

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.043 align:middle line:84%
of stories like yours, where
you're being axed, essentially,

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.336 align:middle line:90%
for just raising questions.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.378 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:12.507 align:middle line:84%
I think people want the
news, not the narrative.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.344 align:middle line:84%
And the Huffington
Post and a number

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of other big
titles, some of them

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.557 align:middle line:84%
on the right-- not all of them
are left-wing publications.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.226 align:middle line:84%
They have money, and they
have seemingly credible names,

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.895 align:middle line:84%
but they're doing
exactly what you said.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.521 align:middle line:90%
They're promoting fake news.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.066 align:middle line:84%
It's not simply the
small independents.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.109 align:middle line:90%
It's also the big corporations.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.944 align:middle line:84%
And I think President
Trump to an extent

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle line:84%
has found a workaround, which
is you just yell "fake news,"

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.367 align:middle line:84%
and you point at the
person who's doing it.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.577 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
claims I make online

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.913 align:middle line:84%
are pretty big,
controversial claims,

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:44.456 align:middle line:84%
but it's always
sourced to something

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.625 align:middle line:84%
that I believe in,
so either a Wikileaks

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
email or a firsthand
source who's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.504 align:middle line:90%
willing to go on the record.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.714 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in things
like, oh, someone told me--

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.007 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you who it is.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.885 align:middle line:84%
There was this thing on the back
of a napkin, and I oversaw it.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.054 align:middle line:84%
That's not my style
of journalism.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.931 align:middle line:84%
And yet the
mainstream media, they

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.183 align:middle line:84%
conduct that style of
journalism, where they say,

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.686 align:middle line:84%
hey, we have unnamed sources
saying A, B, and C. No, no, no,

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
you don't get to
use unnamed sources.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.481 align:middle line:90%
We don't get that luxury.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:10.649 align:middle line:90%
Why do you?

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.109 align:middle line:90%
And we're seeing a lot of that.

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.236 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Yeah, that was
always sort of the luxury

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:18.407 align:middle line:84%
of the investigative
journalists,

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:22.244 align:middle line:84%
was that they basically were
able to have their unnamed

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:25.329 align:middle line:84%
sources, but because oftentimes
their editor knew who it was

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.791 align:middle line:84%
and there was a notion that
there was establishment press--

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:84%
the idea was "The Washington
Post" and "The New York Times,"

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.923 align:middle line:84%
these editors were respected,
and they would know who

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:37.216 align:middle line:84%
the source are and make
sure the story was vetted.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.844 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: We can no
longer trust that.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:39.553 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Exactly.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
you ever could,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.514 align:middle line:84%
because I think it was always
essentially an establishment

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:43.473 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.101 align:middle line:84%
Guys like Sy Hersh have always
been great journalists as far

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.853 align:middle line:84%
as having challenged
the establishment

00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:50.272 align:middle line:84%
and done it repeatedly, so
that gives them credibility.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:51.773 align:middle line:84%
But on the whole,
I think we've seen

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.276 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the feeling of the
establishment press basically

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
serving the establishment
point of view.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle line:84%
And now we're entering a
world where people obviously

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.533 align:middle line:84%
don't need to turn to CNN
or Fox News or "New York

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.326 align:middle line:84%
Times" or "Washington
Post" for their news.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle line:84%
They're getting their news
from a whole collection

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.622 align:middle line:84%
of sources, which is
both-- let's be honest.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.791 align:middle line:84%
It's both dangerous
and positive.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.251 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see it
all the time where

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.378 align:middle line:84%
people are spouting
things, and it's like,

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.338 align:middle line:84%
you just saw someone's
YouTube video,

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.257 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
journalism behind it.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.301 align:middle line:84%
It's just literally
their perspective.

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:25.265 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, how
do we navigate for truth

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:30.353 align:middle line:84%
in what is becoming a
very post-factual reality?

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.482 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I think we're moving
towards trusting individuals

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.525 align:middle line:90%
more than trusting these names.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.528 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned an
individual you trust.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.198 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to see more
of that, where I'll say, look,

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I think Glenn Greenwald is a
good reporter when it comes

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.869 align:middle line:90%
to national security stuff.

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that
it doesn't matter

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.539 align:middle line:84%
if he's working at "The
Guardian" or "The Intercept"

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:50.373 align:middle line:90%
or somewhere else.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.876 align:middle line:84%
It's that name that
remains credible, until he

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.002 align:middle line:90%
kind of blows his cover.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.213 align:middle line:84%
If he does something that
turns out to be false,

00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
then the public should not
trust him as much anymore.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.259 align:middle line:84%
But since he really hasn't,
he has a lot of my trust,

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.552 align:middle line:90%
and the same with Wikileaks--

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
10 years of publishing
actual e-mails.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.016 align:middle line:84%
Not a single one has
been a fake or a fraud,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.434 align:middle line:90%
so they have a lot of my trust.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.728 align:middle line:84%
And other independent
journalists, I think,

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:12.854 align:middle line:90%
should feel the same way.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.439 align:middle line:84%
Unless they breach
that trust, there's

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.775 align:middle line:84%
no reason not to
trust Wikileaks.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.528 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason not
to trust Glenn Greenwald

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:20.737 align:middle line:90%
or other individuals.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.406 align:middle line:84%
There is reason not to trust
"The Washington Post"--

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.783 align:middle line:90%
the change in ownership.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.535 align:middle line:84%
For people who don't
know this, it's

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:29.663 align:middle line:84%
owned by Jeff Bezos, the
guy behind amazon.com

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.414 align:middle line:90%
he owns "The Washington Post."

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.457 align:middle line:84%
Since that ownership
switch, there

00:05:33.457 --> 00:05:35.377 align:middle line:90%
has been a change in narrative.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle line:84%
You can agree or disagree
with the narrative,

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.923 align:middle line:84%
but just to give an example,
"The Washington Post"

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.343 align:middle line:84%
ran a story on their website
calling me an online bully.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.804 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't really push back
against that, because there

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.264 align:middle line:90%
is no individual behind it.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.182 align:middle line:84%
If it was someone like--
if it was Sean Stone,

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.977 align:middle line:84%
I'd say on Twitter, hey, Sean
Stone, why are you saying this?

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle line:90%
And I'd get a response.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:56.106 align:middle line:84%
But it was just "The Washington
Post" says that I'm a bully.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.149 align:middle line:90%
OK, how do we deal with this?

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.317 align:middle line:90%
How is this sourced?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.694 align:middle line:90%
And, in fact, I wasn't a bully.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.696 align:middle line:84%
Just reading out the
things in Wikileaks

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.447 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make one a bully.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.491 align:middle line:84%
But that's what they're
allowed to get away with,

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.618 align:middle line:84%
because they still
have this credibility

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.246 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of many people--
same with the "New York Times."

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:13.039 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
both losing it rapidly.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you start crying wolf
enough times, there's no wolf,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.796 align:middle line:84%
people aren't
going to trust you.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.965 align:middle line:84%
Like the online bully thing,
that probably cost them

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:22.757 align:middle line:90%
some credibility.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.051 align:middle line:84%
Because people go, oh,
he's criticizing someone

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.636 align:middle line:90%
based on very credible things.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.139 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, I think a lot
of that credibility that people

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.308 align:middle line:84%
give to "The Washington
Post" and "New York Times"

00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:32.558 align:middle line:90%
is oftentimes built on money.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.353 align:middle line:84%
It's built on the ability
to brand yourself, right?

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.731 align:middle line:84%
And so once you've
created this notion of,

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.775 align:middle line:84%
we have power and money, we are
able to control the narrative--

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.402 align:middle line:84%
and as you say, people
are now shifting

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their appeal.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.823 align:middle line:84%
The appeal is more
based on personalities,

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.243 align:middle line:84%
based on having a resonance and
believing, I trust this person,

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.746 align:middle line:84%
I like this person, I'm
more inclined to believe

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.414 align:middle line:90%
that narrative.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.707 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that what
we're going to see now

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:59.878 align:middle line:84%
is that Facebook, Twitter,
and these other platforms

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.921 align:middle line:84%
are going to try to
work to basically censor

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:02.881 align:middle line:90%
the alternative voices?

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: Some of them
appear to be heading in that

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.009 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.845 align:middle line:84%
And they're just going
to lose business-wise.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.806 align:middle line:84%
Why would I use Facebook
if I know they're starting

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.683 align:middle line:90%
to censor alternative views?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.393 align:middle line:84%
People used to
log in to Facebook

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.312 align:middle line:84%
to see what their
friends were thinking

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:19.314 align:middle line:84%
and to see what the
non-mainstream people were

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.274 align:middle line:84%
thinking, at least
some people do that.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:24.736 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of Twitter, is
to get these different views.

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.821 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, what I had read--

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.991 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how credible it
is, but Zuckerberg and Facebook

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.078 align:middle line:10%
were considering using
Media Matters for America

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle line:10%
as the third-party vetting
source for what is fake news

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.874 align:middle line:10%
or not.

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:39.959 align:middle line:84%
I take exception to
that, because the founder

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:44.464 align:middle line:84%
of Media Matters is David Brock,
a very close Clinton insider.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.424 align:middle line:84%
This is not a claim that
anybody can push back

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.884 align:middle line:84%
against because
everybody knows it.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.928 align:middle line:84%
He's very close to
the Clintons, and he's

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
very close to some of
the people involved

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.641 align:middle line:84%
in some upcoming
political scandals.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.602 align:middle line:84%
So they're simply not
credible to judge something

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.104 align:middle line:90%
in an unbiased way.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.772 align:middle line:84%
We don't want that
on the right, either.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.691 align:middle line:84%
We don't want some
right-wing think tank

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.401 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what is
news and what is not.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.528 align:middle line:84%
So why would we want the
left-wing version of that?

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.113 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You don't want Steve
Bannon's group basically

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.489 align:middle line:84%
censoring the news
any more than Brock,

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.741 align:middle line:84%
who is a Super PAC donor
for the Democratic Party.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:12.117 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Exactly.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.119 align:middle line:84%
Why should fact-checking
be a political thing?

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:14.703 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.161 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Exactly.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.371 align:middle line:90%
It should not be politicized.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.416 align:middle line:84%
And so I think obviously
the key is going to be,

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.168 align:middle line:90%
how do we survive also?

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Even in this
administration, we don't

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.881 align:middle line:84%
know what's going to
come as far as utilizing

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.634 align:middle line:84%
censorship as a tool
basically to silence

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:30.969 align:middle line:90%
the dissident voices.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.471 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's like people
talk about how America

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
is more divided maybe since
going back to the Civil Rights

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.101 align:middle line:90%
era, the Civil War.

00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
People are talking about
this very divided climate

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.105 align:middle line:90%
as though it's a bad thing.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.565 align:middle line:84%
Don't you agree
maybe actually this

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.691 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what we do need?

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.401 align:middle line:84%
We do need the divisions
so that we can actually

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.695 align:middle line:84%
start to recognize that
we don't have a consensus

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
reality, that in
order to get at truth,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.824 align:middle line:84%
you have to sometimes
divide, you have to question,

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:84%
you have to challenge,
you have to be at odds

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.162 align:middle line:84%
and polarized in order to
find a new middle ground

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.246 align:middle line:90%
or a new reality?

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:00.415 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah, well, let's
look at what's actually

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.207 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.126 align:middle line:84%
"The Washington Post"
is a great example.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.212 align:middle line:84%
Because you have this
brand that people trusted,

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.506 align:middle line:84%
and really, the brand was
trusted because of the work

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.799 align:middle line:90%
of individuals years ago.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.635 align:middle line:84%
The former editor-in-chief
Katharine Graham, I believe,

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.887 align:middle line:90%
was not terrible.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.431 align:middle line:84%
And you go back further,
Woodward and Bernstein-- that's

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.516 align:middle line:84%
the reason why people trust
"The Washington Post,"

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:22.312 align:middle line:84%
is that that was the banner
that broke Watergate, basically.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.606 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
coasting on that popularity

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in that trust for 30 years,
and they've abused it.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think this has happened
in different areas of society,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.988 align:middle line:90%
not just the media.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.698 align:middle line:90%
You look at the US dollar.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:37.827 align:middle line:84%
From Nixon onward, it's just
been a promise, just a note

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.413 align:middle line:84%
that we use based
on mutual faith.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.958 align:middle line:84%
As an intermediate good,
basically, we use US dollars.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.837 align:middle line:84%
And so for 30 years, we've been
coasting on this good faith

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:90%
that is drying up.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.007 align:middle line:90%
Look at the past president.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.802 align:middle line:84%
Close to half the population
did not support him.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:54.636 align:middle line:90%
Look at now.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.055 align:middle line:84%
You have around
half the population

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.724 align:middle line:84%
that does not support the
current elected leader.

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:02.435 align:middle line:84%
So there is definitely
division in the country.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.313 align:middle line:84%
My question is, is
it organic division?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.107 align:middle line:84%
Or is it being directed
by the mainstream media

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.569 align:middle line:84%
to divide us along
different fault lines?

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.321 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
question is, are people

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.739 align:middle line:90%
really so divided and angry?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just upset
because the economy is sliding

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.203 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really have
the language or the outlets

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:20.995 align:middle line:90%
to discuss it?

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.455 align:middle line:84%
Like we all know
inflation is real.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:84%
Like it's not Ron
Paul apocalypse real,

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.418 align:middle line:84%
but we know it's real because
things are more expensive.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.045 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
the framework to talk

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.463 align:middle line:90%
to each other about this.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.423 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the jobs
are not good anymore,

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:35.426 align:middle line:84%
because people who are 50 are
Ubering, whereas they used

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.262 align:middle line:90%
to have a pension or something.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.722 align:middle line:84%
They worked at the factory,
and then they have a pension,

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and they're taken care of.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.434 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is taken care of anymore.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle line:84%
And so there is
definitely division.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But my question is, is it
basically economic unease

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.276 align:middle line:84%
that the elites are
able to redirect

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.402 align:middle line:90%
into certain narratives?

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.112 align:middle line:84%
Or is this just a
divided country?

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.822 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.074 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Going into this
issue of the elites creating

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
a narrative, the Nixon
administration used fake news

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:84%
to create the war on
drugs, if I'm correct.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.291 align:middle line:84%
Describe that
history a little bit.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.209 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I'm not an
expert on the Nixon era,

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:11.337 align:middle line:84%
but my understanding was that
there were really two pushes

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.714 align:middle line:90%
to criminalize cannabis.

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
And the first was in the '30s,
and it was primarily racist.

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was also being
driven by industry.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.515 align:middle line:84%
There were concerns that hemp
was pushing out cotton mills

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
and all of this stuff.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.436 align:middle line:84%
Hemp was in many ways
a superior product,

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:29.188 align:middle line:84%
so the people not pushing
that product obviously

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.523 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get rid of it.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.191 align:middle line:90%
That was the first wave.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.029 align:middle line:84%
And the second wave that
really sealed the nail

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:40.199 align:middle line:84%
in the coffin of cannabis use
in the United States was Nixon.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:42.952 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding was
that some of his advisers

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:90%
were looking around.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.706 align:middle line:84%
There's widespread dissent
to the war in Vietnam--

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:90%
not a popular war.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.586 align:middle line:84%
More and more Americans were
dropping their support for it.

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:53.046 align:middle line:84%
And some of his
advisers go, look,

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.841 align:middle line:84%
we can't put people in prison
for violations for protesting,

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.843 align:middle line:84%
because that's protected
by the First Amendment.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:11:59.969 align:middle line:90%
That's not illegal.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But all these people happen to
have cannabis joints on them.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.893 align:middle line:84%
If we can whip up a frenzy
and get this criminalized,

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.562 align:middle line:84%
all the protesters disappear
because they either

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.272 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be seen
in public, or we're

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:12.941 align:middle line:90%
going to put them in prison.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.442 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that was enacted.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.069 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to an
extent, we're still

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:19.614 align:middle line:84%
living with the poor decisions
of the Nixon administration.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.492 align:middle line:84%
I had an MD recently who
thought I was off the wall

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.911 align:middle line:90%
about my pro-cannabis stuff.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.579 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
looking through some

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.831 align:middle line:84%
of the medical journals
that are coming out now

00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.834 align:middle line:84%
and some of the continuing
education classes for MDs.

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.419 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
to me, my god, we've

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.338 align:middle line:84%
really been misled, like
people should not have

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.714 align:middle line:90%
been going to prison for this.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:39.592 align:middle line:84%
The biopharmacology of
this thing is crazy.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:40.635 align:middle line:90%
It's good for depression.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It's good for IBS.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.221 align:middle line:90%
It's good for arthritis pain.

00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:44.389 align:middle line:90%
He's listing all this stuff.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, look, I know.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.975 align:middle line:90%
I live in Colorado.

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:48.267 align:middle line:90%
I know there's something to it.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.227 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.061 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.313 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you mentioned,
obviously, some of the benefits

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle line:84%
aside from the medicinal
purposes for smoking marijuana,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:59.737 align:middle line:84%
but hemp itself is used for
cloth and clothing, for paper.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.073 align:middle line:84%
Obviously it's a
wonderful plant.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.034 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it's been
so demonized throughout--

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.411 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: Well,
that's the thing.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:90%
It is a plant.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.082 align:middle line:84%
And somehow it made its way
from plant to Schedule 1 drug,

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:14.419 align:middle line:84%
which you think somebody
in a lab concocting things.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.838 align:middle line:84%
Even the most high-grade
versions of cannabis

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.382 align:middle line:84%
that people are
fearmongered against,

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.509 align:middle line:84%
you're just taking the
oil from the plant,

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.511 align:middle line:90%
and then you're vaporizing it.

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:26.097 align:middle line:90%
There's no drug use.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:28.558 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But I believe you've
said smoking weed is actually

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.309 align:middle line:90%
a religious experience, right?

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:32.395 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: Not many people
have made this argument,

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.396 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not sure why.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.816 align:middle line:84%
Because as far as I can
tell, it would actually work.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.609 align:middle line:84%
It's First-Amendment
protected activity.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.279 align:middle line:84%
And I know there have been
attempts in states like Indiana

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.407 align:middle line:84%
to set up churches, saying
this is one of our practices.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.367 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
need to go that far.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:49.495 align:middle line:84%
I genuinely believe that it's
a spiritual practice when

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.955 align:middle line:90%
a person gets high.

00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:55.752 align:middle line:84%
And in Genesis of the Bible,
the Judeo-Christian God

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:59.756 align:middle line:84%
says that you have access
to every seed-bearing plant.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:03.051 align:middle line:84%
Well, cannabis sativa is
not an exception from that.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.635 align:middle line:90%
It's a seed-bearing plant.

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:07.263 align:middle line:84%
And it was found naturally
throughout North America.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.891 align:middle line:84%
So why would that one be
one that God doesn't like?

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.809 align:middle line:84%
Why would that one be
one that's off limits?

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.478 align:middle line:90%
Of course, God doesn't care.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:14.896 align:middle line:90%
It's Nixon that didn't like it.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:16.731 align:middle line:90%
And we know now why.

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.067 align:middle line:84%
So we need to correct
course there, I think.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.777 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, it is a
spiritual experience.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.322 align:middle line:84%
I think whenever you
get outside of sober--

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.199 align:middle line:90%
you said consensus reality--

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.867 align:middle line:84%
whenever you break
out of that, you're

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.827 align:middle line:84%
doing something
that is spiritual.

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:32.455 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the US,
the founding fathers,

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:84%
some people believe,
we're into cannabis.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.084 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that for sure.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:37.627 align:middle line:84%
What we do know for
sure is that they

00:14:37.627 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
were into the hemp industry.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we know other Western
thinkers like Shakespeare, they

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
believe, were using cannabis.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.221 align:middle line:84%
They found THC residue in
one of his smoking pipes.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.389 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't make a big
deal out of it then?

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.433 align:middle line:84%
It was not regulated
or criminalized.

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:56.813 align:middle line:84%
So your average adult man who
was in an intellectual field

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle line:84%
might have just used
cannabis, and there

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.817 align:middle line:84%
would have been no
public discussion of it

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.485 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
like drinking a tea.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.861 align:middle line:90%
Why would you point that out?

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.029 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Well, absolutely.

00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:06.614 align:middle line:84%
I mean, frankly we
know historically

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:10.326 align:middle line:84%
that drugs were often used
for initiatory purposes

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.494 align:middle line:90%
within religious contexts.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.162 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, the
biggest argument

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.581 align:middle line:84%
that I could say against
certain drugs, whether it

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.793 align:middle line:84%
be cocaine or heroin or
the more hardcore drugs,

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:20.545 align:middle line:84%
is that they basically
have deviated

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.923 align:middle line:84%
from the original plant and the
original purpose of it, which

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.467 align:middle line:84%
was not just for recreation
and fun and partying,

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.094 align:middle line:84%
but actually to
have an awakening

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.471 align:middle line:90%
and a raising of consciousness.

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.515 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we're
going to potentially see,

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:36.561 align:middle line:84%
because of the legalization
of marijuana in states

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:39.647 align:middle line:84%
like Colorado and Washington
and now California,

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.441 align:middle line:84%
that it's really just going
to boom, that ultimately we're

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.485 align:middle line:84%
going to see America
transformed in the next four

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.279 align:middle line:84%
to eight years, let's
say, and legalization

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.363 align:middle line:90%
across the country?

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.157 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I think
we're already seeing it.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.534 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, New
York State now has medical.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.619 align:middle line:84%
I met a woman who
has a medical card.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.414 align:middle line:84%
She's now getting legal
cannabis in New York, which

00:15:56.414 --> 00:16:00.168 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
big-government regulated,

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:84%
anti-cannabis states,
in my opinion.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.841 align:middle line:84%
And she has access to it now,
thanks to them moving forward.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Massachusetts has
legal recreational.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.637 align:middle line:90%
That's been enacted.

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.181 align:middle line:90%
So just a matter of time now.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I'd
see within my lifetime

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.394 align:middle line:84%
legal recreational
weed in Boston.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.104 align:middle line:90%
I guess it makes sense, right?

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:23.107 align:middle line:84%
The original Tea
Party started there.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.567 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:27.987 align:middle line:84%
Just earlier this morning,
I think two hours ago, Maine

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.031 align:middle line:90%
officially legalized.

00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:32.408 align:middle line:84%
So now you can grow
and consume in Maine.

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.285 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely seems
like it's happening.

00:16:34.285 --> 00:16:36.787 align:middle line:84%
The argument against
it has fallen the way.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.706 align:middle line:90%
I've smoked hundreds of times.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.667 align:middle line:84%
I haven't noticed any
reduction in intelligence.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.712 align:middle line:84%
I know many successful
type-A people who smoke,

00:16:44.712 --> 00:16:46.339 align:middle line:84%
and I think we are
simply lied to.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.882 align:middle line:84%
I think it's easier
to just say, hey,

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.259 align:middle line:84%
we were lied to, than
to continue to come up

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.844 align:middle line:90%
with all these explanations.

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:54.472 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk to somebody every
once in a while in Alabama

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.266 align:middle line:84%
or Georgia, and they give me
this reasoning where it's like,

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.977 align:middle line:84%
no, no, no, we can't have it
here because of A, B, and C.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, it's
the same plant.

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.439 align:middle line:84%
It's not any different in
Colorado or California.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.858 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look
at the science,

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.443 align:middle line:90%
as that MD was telling me.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:11.739 align:middle line:84%
There are these amazing
biopharmacology properties

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:13.866 align:middle line:90%
that don't exist anywhere else.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.951 align:middle line:90%
And people are adults.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.493 align:middle line:90%
They deserve the best treatment.

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:84%
And they deserve that
spiritual experience.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.791 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Even anti-carcinogenic
purposes, as I understand it,

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.919 align:middle line:84%
like hemp oil, for example,
is supposed to be great

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.087 align:middle line:90%
for combating cancers.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.797 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: That's what
people are saying.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:29.423 align:middle line:84%
And anecdotally,
there's a lot of stuff

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.176 align:middle line:84%
that it's great for--
seizures, great for depression.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
People have to
realize for many years

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the only studies that
were being funded

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.556 align:middle line:90%
were ones trying to prove harm.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:40.142 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you do that, you're not
going to find the good stuff.

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:44.063 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have a thawing
of views on weed, let's look.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.439 align:middle line:84%
Does it actually
help depression?

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:46.816 align:middle line:90%
Does it actually help IBS?

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:50.069 align:middle line:84%
Does it actually help with
anti-cancer properties?

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.029 align:middle line:90%
And so far the answer--

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.782 align:middle line:84%
it's a cautious answer,
but it seems to be yes.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But there obviously is
one concern I know from smaller

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.244 align:middle line:90%
growers.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.539 align:middle line:84%
As they're seeing
legalization of marijuana,

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.125 align:middle line:84%
potentially you're going to see
basically the big agribusiness

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:04.583 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.043 align:middle line:84%
The Monsantos of
the world they see

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
coming in and putting their
herbicides and pesticides

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
into the plants themselves,
controlling the industry.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.265 align:middle line:84%
Is that a potential danger
from this legalization process?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I think there are
always dangers from the big

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:90%
money taking over.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:90%
But I'll give you an example.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.565 align:middle line:84%
In Maryland, they have
already passed medical laws,

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.233 align:middle line:84%
but there has been
this big holdup.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually have any
dispensaries serving weed yet,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.488 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
passed years ago.

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.824 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is that the
Maryland Cannabis Commission,

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:40.786 align:middle line:84%
from what I understand, they're
facing potential lawsuits

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.456 align:middle line:84%
from minority
groups in Maryland.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:46.792 align:middle line:84%
Basically a bunch of black
business owners are saying,

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.087 align:middle line:84%
we didn't get the right number
of licenses in the bidding

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.507 align:middle line:84%
Minority-owned
businesses were shut out,

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.761 align:middle line:84%
and it was just big cannabis
that got the contracts.

00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.721 align:middle line:84%
And so they're pushing
back against it.

00:18:58.721 --> 00:19:01.515 align:middle line:84%
And I personally disagree
with them in this case.

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:04.226 align:middle line:84%
It's great if you can
make money from marijuana.

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:90%
More power to you.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.772 align:middle line:84%
You can do it legally
and hire people.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:12.193 align:middle line:84%
Here in Colorado, I think
16,500 jobs have been added

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.362 align:middle line:90%
due to the legalization thing.

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:16.906 align:middle line:84%
So, great-- but I don't
think the primary purpose

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.992 align:middle line:84%
of legalization should be to
make money for entrepreneurs.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.995 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to get it
decriminalized and available

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.372 align:middle line:90%
ASAP.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.791 align:middle line:84%
And look, if Monsanto is
going to make all the money

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or Coca-Cola is going to launch
some weed product or something,

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
then that's going to
happen, and you're not

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.213 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to stop it.

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.465 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't want people
going to prison for it,

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:37.593 align:middle line:84%
and I just don't want cancer
patients and arthritis patients

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:39.762 align:middle line:84%
and people with seizures
to not be able to get it

00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:42.223 align:middle line:84%
because somebody is
saying, hey, the big guys

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.557 align:middle line:90%
are crushing me out of this.

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.017 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
only industry where

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.645 align:middle line:84%
the big money moves in and
pushes out the craft beer,

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:48.437 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:49.397 align:middle line:90%
We see this in alcohol.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.523 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.274 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need
to consider that,

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:54.318 align:middle line:84%
but I just want to see
legal as soon as possible.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:56.153 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Yeah, and I
totally agree with you,

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.656 align:middle line:84%
especially with the prison
population where half of it is

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.033 align:middle line:84%
based on nonviolent crimes,
including things like

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:01.826 align:middle line:90%
marijuana.

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:05.037 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned earlier
about the US dollar,

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.665 align:middle line:84%
obviously the strongest
currency in the world

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.959 align:middle line:90%
over this post-World War II era.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.963 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is this new
Bitcoin online currency

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.966 align:middle line:90%
that's now circulating.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:17.758 align:middle line:90%
What is Bitcoin?

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.803 align:middle line:84%
And how will it
compare ultimately

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.597 align:middle line:84%
to the dollar and potentially
transcend the dollar?

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:25.933 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah, this relates
to your idea of reality

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.811 align:middle line:84%
fracturing, of consensus
reality fracturing.

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.896 align:middle line:84%
Because you need a strong
consensus for something

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.606 align:middle line:90%
like the dollar to work.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:35.317 align:middle line:84%
It's the fiat currency
for the United States.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:37.069 align:middle line:84%
So a good way of
thinking about it is it's

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.363 align:middle line:84%
like an arcade
token when you enter

00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.282 align:middle line:90%
the arcade, known as the US.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You hit US soil, you
have to use our tokens

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.538 align:middle line:84%
to pay for everything from
parking to food, et cetera.

00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:50.499 align:middle line:84%
You go to the EU, you
have to use the euro token

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.584 align:middle line:90%
to do something there.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.587 align:middle line:84%
So there is a rarity that builds
up over time for these tokens

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.464 align:middle line:84%
because we need
them to do anything.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.507 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
the creation process,

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:01.135 align:middle line:84%
it is literally just an
old woman in New York City,

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.595 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
Federal Reserve.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.639 align:middle line:84%
It's Janet Yellen and
her board of governors.

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:08.225 align:middle line:84%
They decide when to create
more of these tokens.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:84%
You look at the EU, it's Draghi
and his peers in Brussels,

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:15.441 align:middle line:84%
I believe, or in
Belgium, saying, look,

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:17.902 align:middle line:84%
we're going to create this
many new euro over the next two

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:18.694 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:19.653 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
That's just a human
being deciding something.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.407 align:middle line:84%
It's just an
unelected politician

00:21:23.407 --> 00:21:24.909 align:middle line:90%
coming up with something.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.953 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin was invented
some eight years ago.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.915 align:middle line:84%
And like the dollar, like
the euro, just a rare token.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.249 align:middle line:90%
It's called a bitcoin.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:33.918 align:middle line:90%
It's not called a US dollar.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:35.586 align:middle line:84%
But he put some
cool limits on it.

00:21:35.586 --> 00:21:39.548 align:middle line:84%
There are only 21 million
coins that will ever exist.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:44.094 align:middle line:84%
And right now, about 16.5
million coins have been mined.

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.347 align:middle line:84%
And so he created a
software program that

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:49.016 align:middle line:90%
mimics the psychology of gold.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Gold always emerged
throughout history

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.896 align:middle line:84%
as a really good form of money
because it's a rare token, just

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:90%
like the dollar.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.107 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something
that's political.

00:21:57.107 --> 00:22:00.528 align:middle line:84%
When you have a piece of
gold, that was a fair process,

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.696 align:middle line:84%
because someone somewhere
had to mine for it.

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if it was 500 years
ago in some king's camp,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.952 align:middle line:84%
it was mined at one
point, and there

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.829 align:middle line:84%
is an exchange of labor
for this form of money.

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.248 align:middle line:84%
With the dollar
and the euro, that

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.416 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist, because
they're creating it

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.876 align:middle line:90%
through political decree.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:19.755 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin brings us back to that
fair, older version of money,

00:22:19.755 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
because every token of bitcoin
that's out there, someone

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.801 align:middle line:90%
had to mine for it.

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.553 align:middle line:84%
Someone's computer
in their basement

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:26.887 align:middle line:90%
or in their dorm room--

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.764 align:middle line:84%
or now it's actually
professional facilities

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.182 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of cases.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.018 align:middle line:84%
Some server somewhere
mined for that coin

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and expended labor and
time, computing time,

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.189 align:middle line:90%
to earn that coin.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.148 align:middle line:90%
So it's a neat idea.

00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:38.941 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:41.986 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that there's a
fixed amount of this bitcoin.

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But what makes it different from
just any of the currency that

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.616 align:middle line:84%
floats basically
on the exchange,

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:50.911 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how in-demand
it is raises the value

00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:52.079 align:middle line:90%
or splinters it?

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:52.955 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Sure.

00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
technical differences.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.335 align:middle line:84%
Whoever created it-- Satoshi
Nakamoto is the pseudonym he

00:22:58.335 --> 00:22:59.378 align:middle line:90%
used--

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.756 align:middle line:84%
the rarity is enforced by this
thing called the block chain.

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.968 align:middle line:84%
So there is a ledger of every
single Bitcoin transaction,

00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:08.971 align:middle line:84%
going back to the very
first ones in 2009.

00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.766 align:middle line:84%
And every block of transactions
builds of the prior block.

00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:15.728 align:middle line:84%
I won't get into the
details, but basically it's

00:23:15.728 --> 00:23:18.647 align:middle line:84%
like a big puzzle board,
where the next puzzle

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.566 align:middle line:84%
piece doesn't fit
in unless you've

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.318 align:middle line:90%
solved the previous puzzle.

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:25.821 align:middle line:84%
So every block every 10
minutes is reconciled,

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.823 align:middle line:84%
all those transactions,
and then it

00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:30.117 align:middle line:84%
becomes a part of the permanent
record in this ledger,

00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:31.327 align:middle line:90%
this block chain.

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:33.162 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
keep it rare, is

00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:35.956 align:middle line:84%
there's no introduction
of counterfeit bitcoin.

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.791 align:middle line:84%
There's no increase
in the money supply.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.294 align:middle line:84%
It's still going to be
a max of 21 million.

00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:42.963 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: We've seen historically
people have cornered the silver

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.465 align:middle line:84%
market, cornered
the gold market.

00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:46.759 align:middle line:84%
Why can't a George
Soros or Bill Gates

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.762 align:middle line:84%
go in and basically with his
minions buy up all the bitcoins

00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:51.972 align:middle line:84%
and corner the
market and basically

00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:53.557 align:middle line:90%
control the price at that point?

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.559 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I think that
could definitely happen,

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.769 align:middle line:90%
at least temporarily.

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:58.729 align:middle line:90%
There's no control against that.

00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:01.565 align:middle line:84%
What's so neat about bitcoin is
that we just see all the terms.

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:03.192 align:middle line:90%
We know how many exist.

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
We can see them moving
around the world thanks

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.654 align:middle line:90%
to that block chain innovation.

00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:08.864 align:middle line:84%
So there's more transparency
than with the dollar.

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is the
difference in how it's created.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.829 align:middle line:84%
You have individuals voluntarily
deciding to mine for bitcoin

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.623 align:middle line:84%
because they think
they'll make a profit

00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:19.667 align:middle line:84%
or because they're
ideologically aligned

00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:21.168 align:middle line:90%
with government-free money.

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:22.753 align:middle line:84%
Whatever their
reason is, they're

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:25.047 align:middle line:90%
voluntarily deciding to use it.

00:24:25.047 --> 00:24:26.465 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the difference.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.592 align:middle line:84%
When I was born
in this country, I

00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:31.345 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a say in whether
or not all of my labor

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:34.181 align:middle line:90%
would be represented by dollars.

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:35.057 align:middle line:90%
I was born here.

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.558 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be
represented that way.

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.019 align:middle line:84%
Except Janet Yellen-- I've
never met her before--

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:41.689 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily agree
with her views on the world.

00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:43.315 align:middle line:84%
So why should that
be my currency?

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:43.607 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.401 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is this is a way of
challenging the Federal Reserve

00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.235 align:middle line:90%
System.

00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, there will
be more bitcoin-type

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.365 align:middle line:84%
of virtual currencies
that pop up,

00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.158 align:middle line:84%
basically like in a
free-market system,

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.869 align:middle line:84%
where there's not a centralized
control over the currency.

00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:57.871 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
argument that the elite

00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.249 align:middle line:84%
do want to go to a
cashless society.

00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:84%
They're moving in that
direction in India, for example.

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: They are.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.378 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And the
question is that,

00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:05.838 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that make
it easier, then,

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:08.841 align:middle line:84%
for the powers that be
to basically monitor

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
our transactions if we do go
cashless through these things

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.302 align:middle line:90%
like bitcoin?

00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:15.723 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: So my understanding
is the elites within finance

00:25:15.723 --> 00:25:17.516 align:middle line:90%
really love central banks.

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.185 align:middle line:84%
Because then they can get
somebody like Janet Yellen

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.731 align:middle line:84%
or like her counterparts at the
EU to just do what they want.

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:25.733 align:middle line:84%
So, hey, you have to print
more money this year.

00:25:25.733 --> 00:25:27.443 align:middle line:90%
We need some inflation.

00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.069 align:middle line:90%
We need some monetary growth.

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:30.446 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets done.

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:33.031 align:middle line:84%
There's always this ability
to push back politically

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.491 align:middle line:90%
on the money system.

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Bitcoin is divorced from that.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.872 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned that it's a
protest of the Federal Reserve.

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:40.956 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.458 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
global invention.

00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:45.127 align:middle line:84%
There are people in China who
don't trust their government,

00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:47.045 align:middle line:84%
and they've made a lot
of money from whatever,

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:90%
from a computer company.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
They don't want all of their
savings going into Chinese yuan

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.427 align:middle line:84%
because they see the
Chinese government keeps

00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:90%
printing more of them.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.682 align:middle line:84%
So they want bitcoin as a way of
jumping out the global economy.

00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:00.517 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
in countries like India

00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
who want it for
the same reasons.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.855 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to remember is
bitcoin is the ultimate cash.

00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It is government-free cash.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.942 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about a
move to a cashless society,

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
it's a real concern.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.861 align:middle line:90%
It is happening.

00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:13.822 align:middle line:84%
But bitcoin is a cash
they don't control.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:16.575 align:middle line:84%
And if Soros or somebody
wants to corner the market,

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.661 align:middle line:84%
he's going to pay a
price reflexivity.

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:22.581 align:middle line:84%
Bitcoin is so rare that to
attempt to corner the market

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
would drive you up to,
let's say, a $10,000 coin

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.211 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, at which
point you couldn't

00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:28.462 align:middle line:90%
control much of the market.

00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:29.379 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.256 align:middle line:84%
Once they signal how
much they want it,

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
they're only going to be
able to buy a small percent

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:33.926 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of us.

00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: They
would outprice you.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.427 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:37.471 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So there's a
question from our audience.

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.224 align:middle line:10%
Lauren in Texas asks, so
what does happen to Bitcoin

00:26:40.224 --> 00:26:42.017 align:middle line:10%
if the government
tries to regulate it?

00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:10%
How is Bitcoin designed
such that government

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.189 align:middle line:10%
can't regulate it, for example?

00:26:47.189 --> 00:26:49.274 align:middle line:10%
Or can the government
regulate it?

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.568 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAMAN: In, the US, there's
already been substantial

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:52.361 align:middle line:10%
discussion.

00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:55.155 align:middle line:84%
And not formal
regulation in all states,

00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but definitely
the companies that

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with
bitcoin are regulated

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:03.831 align:middle line:84%
SMBs, as Money Service
Businesses, in some cases.

00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:05.207 align:middle line:84%
There's been a
lot of controversy

00:27:05.207 --> 00:27:06.959 align:middle line:90%
over whether that's necessary.

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:09.378 align:middle line:84%
But companies like
Coinbase have been courting

00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:11.171 align:middle line:90%
all of the licenses and stuff.

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:14.383 align:middle line:84%
There already is regulation
around bitcoin in the US.

00:27:14.383 --> 00:27:16.468 align:middle line:84%
There's some
regulation in Europe.

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:19.346 align:middle line:84%
China seems to keep going back
and forth as to whether or not

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:20.848 align:middle line:90%
they condone it or not.

00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:23.517 align:middle line:84%
But for the time being, it
exists in a gray area, where

00:27:23.517 --> 00:27:25.227 align:middle line:90%
it's certainly legal to buy.

00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:27.145 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly legal to sell.

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The tax implications
aren't necessarily

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:90%
fully fleshed out everywhere.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's reached the
point of legality,

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.446 align:middle line:84%
where you can at least obtain
it without many problems.

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So ultimately you think
that Bitcoin is the currency

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.492 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Or at least let's say
that cyber currencies will

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
be our future currencies?

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.915 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: I think Bitcoin
is promising so far.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:48.959 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a
social phenomenon.

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:52.045 align:middle line:84%
It was people saying, hey, we
don't want US dollars anymore.

00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.214 align:middle line:84%
You just collapse
our financial system.

00:27:54.214 --> 00:27:57.718 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep in mind,
Bitcoin launched in early 2009.

00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:59.094 align:middle line:84%
And there are
indications that he

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
was doing that as
a partial protest

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.514 align:middle line:90%
to the financial collapse.

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:05.767 align:middle line:84%
One of the notes on an
early Bitcoin transaction

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:09.187 align:middle line:84%
referenced a news story about
the collapse, I believe.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:84%
So a number of
young people said,

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.649 align:middle line:84%
we're going to represent
our value with bitcoin

00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:14.735 align:middle line:90%
instead of US dollars or euro.

00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:17.195 align:middle line:84%
Way too early to tell
if bitcoin is the one.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Promising so far, but
gold does something

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.158 align:middle line:90%
in a very similar way.

00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:25.203 align:middle line:84%
And gold has existed without
interruption for 6,000 years.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:28.373 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a fan of gold and
bitcoin for different reasons.

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:31.793 align:middle line:84%
But Bitcoin definitely
attempts to mimic the success

00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:32.586 align:middle line:90%
that gold has had.

00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:34.713 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't had
internet money before.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.924 align:middle line:84%
So it's just so new
it's hard to say.

00:28:36.924 --> 00:28:39.426 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So I think I think
what you just said about bitcoin

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.428 align:middle line:84%
being like the virtual
version of gold,

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:46.183 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
really astute analogy.

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:48.977 align:middle line:84%
In your assessment overall,
the landscape of what

00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:51.897 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at, are
we looking basically

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:53.315 align:middle line:90%
at the post nation-state world?

00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think
that's what's coming?

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.818 align:middle line:10%
So basically it's
smart to get out

00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:59.863 align:middle line:10%
of the Federal-Reserve-backed
dollar system and economy

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:10%
as much as possible and try
to basically open ourselves up

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:10%
as virtual citizens,
online citizens,

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.206 align:middle line:10%
creating our own cyberspace, our
own virtual communities, things

00:29:09.206 --> 00:29:10.207 align:middle line:10%
like this?

00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:10.624 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah.

00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:12.209 align:middle line:84%
That's another
question that's so big.

00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:14.002 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which
direction it'll go in,

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:17.214 align:middle line:84%
but we're starting to
realize globalism failed.

00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The elites in academia
and in finance

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.052 align:middle line:84%
have been pushing
us toward globalism,

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:23.845 align:middle line:84%
and we've reached this
breaking point where

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:25.806 align:middle line:90%
it can't be integrated anymore.

00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:28.433 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing pushback
from different nations--

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.020 align:middle line:84%
EU, the UK with
their Brexit, here

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.065 align:middle line:84%
in the US with the
election of Donald Trump.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:37.401 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing a
return to nationalism.

00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:39.695 align:middle line:10%
And nationalism does
not mean socialism.

00:29:39.695 --> 00:29:41.196 align:middle line:10%
It does not mean racism.

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:43.865 align:middle line:10%
It just means a return to
nationalistic economies.

00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:46.785 align:middle line:84%
I think as that
continues to fracture,

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.495 align:middle line:84%
you'll see some
weird stuff happen.

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:51.456 align:middle line:84%
We are, in a sense, living
in a postmodern world.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:55.836 align:middle line:84%
How is it that Bitcoin is
a $14.5-billion market cap

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:58.755 align:middle line:84%
currency when eight years
ago it was zero dollars?

00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:02.092 align:middle line:84%
So we've put $14.5
billion of faith

00:30:02.092 --> 00:30:04.469 align:middle line:84%
into Bitcoin in
just eight years.

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.346 align:middle line:84%
People are consumers
at the end of the day.

00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:07.681 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm a consumer.

00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:09.474 align:middle line:84%
I want to use the
best possible money.

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:12.019 align:middle line:84%
If it's gold or bitcoin,
why would I use dollars?

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to start saving
in gold and bitcoin.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.606 align:middle line:90%
I want the best possible news.

00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:19.234 align:middle line:84%
If you're providing it, then
why would I watch CNN, right?

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:21.778 align:middle line:84%
So I think as consumers,
we're just so smart

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.531 align:middle line:84%
with our smartphones that we're
getting all this information.

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:27.868 align:middle line:84%
Same with cannabis-- I was very
conservative as a young person.

00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:30.829 align:middle line:84%
I found it was simply
not what I was told.

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.789 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, at what point

00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:34.875 align:middle line:84%
do you keep parroting
things that are not true

00:30:34.875 --> 00:30:36.376 align:middle line:84%
when your own
personal experience is

00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:37.544 align:middle line:90%
this thing is very beautiful?

00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:39.129 align:middle line:84%
It's helped a number
of people get out

00:30:39.129 --> 00:30:40.881 align:middle line:84%
of pain and addiction
and all this stuff.

00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:42.716 align:middle line:84%
It helps you have
creative thoughts.

00:30:42.716 --> 00:30:45.594 align:middle line:84%
So like Bitcoin, if
it's outperforming,

00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:47.345 align:middle line:90%
consumers will move toward it.

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.097 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: I think that's
a great summation.

00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.516 align:middle line:84%
And it gives optimism,
I think, for where

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.559 align:middle line:90%
we're going, essentially.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.687 align:middle line:84%
It's not a clear path,
but at least the idea of--

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.564 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAMAN: It's not
clear, but it's exciting.

00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.274 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --the consumer
being empowered,

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:01.943 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the best message
that we can offer people,

00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:04.529 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that they have
been empowered by the virtual

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:84%
revolution, by the
cyberspace revolution.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.367 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even know where
it's going to go from here.

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:09.951 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Definitely.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:11.286 align:middle line:90%
It's like Terrance McKenna said.

00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:14.372 align:middle line:84%
The cybernetic revolution,
the computer, the internet,

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:17.084 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff, it wasn't meant
for us, but we have it now.

00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:18.752 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting all
the benefits of it.

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:19.503 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah.

00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:20.629 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me today, David.

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.379 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate your time.

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:21.671 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAMAN: Yeah.

00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:22.464 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.381 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Pleasure.

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.467 align:middle line:84%
And there you go, folks--
fascinating insights

00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:26.259 align:middle line:90%
from David Seaman.

00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:10%
You might agree with or believe
everything said here today,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.472 align:middle line:10%
so I urge to check
out his YouTube

00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:33.683 align:middle line:10%
channel, DavidSeamanOnline,
for more details.

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:35.936 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:37.062 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:39.314 align:middle line:84%
It requires constant
reassessment.

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:40.899 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.109 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:46.071 align:middle line:90%
