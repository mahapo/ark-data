00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE:
Welcome to Buzzsaw,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.855 align:middle line:84%
where we cut through
the mainstream narrative

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:18.270 align:middle line:90%
to explore the hidden truths.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and with me today is

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:10%
a familiar guest, Billy Carson.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of
4biddenknowledge.com

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.042 align:middle line:90%
and unitethe99.com.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Bill has combined forces
with the top anomaly hunters

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.859 align:middle line:84%
in the world to form the United
Family of Anomaly Hunters.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Their mission is to
provide enough evidence

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of past and present
life on Earth

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and other celestial bodies
inside our own solar system.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, he joins me to
reveal his research

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
on genetic manipulation
and much more.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with this.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:10%
You know, recently the
Kazakhstani scientists

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:10%
have come forth with this
paper talking about the number

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:10%
37 that appears they say
about nine separate times

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.587 align:middle line:10%
in the human genetic coding.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:10%
And so they're saying,
look, the coincidence

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:10%
like that, this would occur
about 1 in 10 trillion times,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
So their whole thing is
just based on this number 37

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:10%
popping up so many
times, they think

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:10%
it's a sign of
intentional design.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Does this look like vindication
for the Anunnaki theory?

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Basically, there has been
tampering, alien manipulation

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:90%
of the human genome.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:10%
>>BILLY CARSON:
Well, it definitely

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:10%
is evidence of tampering
of the human genome,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:10%
because to get that, like they
said, it's one in a trillion.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd have
a better chance

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of winning the lottery
every single day before this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
can actually happen
just by happenstance

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.182 align:middle line:90%
in normal evolution.

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I think
has really happened

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is not only is it vindication
that the Anunnaki came here

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and genetically
modified the existing

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
hominids on this
planet, but I think even

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
prior to the Anunnaki,
there may have

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
been other species
visiting this planet

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and basically genetically
encoding us as well.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So even the existing
hominid might have already

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.504 align:middle line:84%
been modified before
the Anunnaki got here,

00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and they may have
just put the finishing

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.407 align:middle line:90%
touches on that modification.

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I really do
believe that Earth

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
is like a gigantic laboratory.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, in fact,
that's the argument made,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
is that on one hand, there are
those who say the Anunnaki sky

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:84%
gods are the ones that
created mankind, basically

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:90%
from some kind of sapien.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:10%
Merging the sapien some
kind of monkey creature,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.919 align:middle line:10%
with the alien to
create a human.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the argument
that says, wait a minute,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki just were
sort of the last ones

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to come to then manipulate
the human genome

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
or maybe to limit
it, and to basically

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
create the modern
human, and then

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:90%
proclaim themselves our gods.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What's
your take on that?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.419 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: There's a couple
of takes because, one

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:10%
is Neanderthal, who is
thought now currently

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:10%
to be a lower IQ than a human,
some scientists are coming

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.722 align:middle line:10%
forward saying, wait a minute,
the actual Neanderthal may have

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:10%
actually been smarter
than the modern day

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:10%
human with more cranial space,
and so forth, and just some

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:10%
of the research.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And smarter not meaning, did
they know quantum physics,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:10%
but they were more in tune with
the planet, with the Earth.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They were more in
tune with nature.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They may have had better
access to their higher

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.302 align:middle line:90%
sensory perception.

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, like how
animals can tell

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
there's an earthquake coming,
and they get out of Dodge

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:90%
long before it comes.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Or the animals in the
Philippines before the tsunami

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
hit, the wild animals
all left, you know,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.116 align:middle line:84%
so those type of
intuitions and things,

00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
they might have
been better tuned

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:90%
than the modern day human.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But it really is showing
that it's possible that even

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
like the Ubaid culture, who
was here prior to the Anunnaki,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and those Ubaid
statuettes have been

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.865 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Iraq,
where they actually

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
look like reptilian people.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They're prior to the
Anunnaki's arrival.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They were prior to the Sumerian
civilization, I should say.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And they actually depict
humanoid reptilians

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
even breastfeeding, and these
are some amazing artifacts

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.092 align:middle line:84%
that are real, that are
actually in museums.

00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a replica
of two of them at my house.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
One is a male and
one is a female.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:90%
It's actually breastfeeding.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the Anunnaki
get here, they really

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
want to take us
to another level,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but to make us subservient
at the same time.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that the
main objective that they had

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
was to make a slave race that
would be subservient to them,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that would worship them, and
would do all their bidding

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.127 align:middle line:90%
with no questions asked.

00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they achieved.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.126 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because
we are now delving

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.359 align:middle line:84%
into this realm of genetic
modification ourselves,

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
actually understand

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
the human genome, starting to do
genetic modification on crops,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
on animals,
potentially on humans.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And does that then
beg the question,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:90%
did the Anunnaki modify us?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the texts
talk about them using us

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%
as sort of slave labor.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But did they modify
us and actually

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
then continue to live
amongst the humans,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
but in a human form?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Are they still here basically?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I believe
they're still here.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.488 align:middle line:84%
I mean, going back
even to the part

00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
where they genetically modified
us potentially as slaves,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
it was very interesting the
way that the Atrahasis epic

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
describes the
creation of mankind,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
even when you go through the
seven tablets of creation

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
in the Enuma Elish, one
of the Anunnaki goddesses,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.594 align:middle line:84%
basically, after many
failed attempts of creating

00:04:52.594 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
a perfect human that can
replicate on its own,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
they actually had
people here they

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.712 align:middle line:84%
were making in these
cloning chambers,

00:04:58.712 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
replicate on their own.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.634 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't reproduce.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, she said, OK,
what I'm going to do

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.591 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to take an egg
out of an existing hominid,

00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to clean up
the genetic material.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put genetic
material in from ourselves,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Enki actually
who donated his sperm,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.291 align:middle line:84%
and then she put the zygote
back in her own womb,

00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:90%
and then took it to full term.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's when they actually
created the first genetically

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:10%
perfected human, the more modern
human that we are right now.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:10%
In that, they also did
something with the DNA,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:10%
because it's what they
call junk DNA, that's

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:10%
where they disconnected the
higher levels of consciousness

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:10%
and intellect to keep
us at a specific level,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:10%
but we still had long
lifespans at that time.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.487 align:middle line:84%
But the main goal that they
did this, the reason why

00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:39.611 align:middle line:84%
they started that whole
project in the first place,

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:41.695 align:middle line:84%
was because they were tired
of doing all the labor

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.319 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, all the mining,
all the farming, and everything

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the first
part of the question.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And the second part of the
question you had asked was--

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.328 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Whether or
not the Anunnaki

00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
could still be living
here amongst us

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.479 align:middle line:84%
basically as our rulers, as the
elite bloodlines, for example?

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Now, that's
a very good question.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.886 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to
the Emerald Tablets,

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
which were written by Thoth
the Atlantean, who's actually

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the son of Enki, so
he's actually obviously

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:90%
younger than Enki.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
He has been around for
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:10%
In the Emerald
Tablets, he describes

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.556 align:middle line:10%
going into this chamber
underneath the Great Pyramid

00:06:12.556 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:10%
called the Halls of Amenti.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And in this chamber
underneath the Great Pyramid,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
he actually says he's
descended 100 times

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:90%
10, which is 100,000 years.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So every so many
years he goes down

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to this chamber for
100 years at a time.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So over the course
of so many eons,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
he's gone down there for
100,000 combined years.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So the Sumerian text is
only 6,000 years old, as far

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
as we know, so
based on that, we'd

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
have to think that these gods,
these people, these beings,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
could potentially still be alive
and they could be anywhere.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:90%
They could be on Earth.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.306 align:middle line:84%
There are some of
their offspring,

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
because we do know that Enki
married or mated with humans.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Thoth also took on a
human wife as well,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and this bloodline could be
still here today propagating.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that's the bloodline that

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
started the pharaonic
bloodline, which

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
then migrated after the
last pyramid war into Arabia

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and then into Europe.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So the bloodline actually
evolved over time,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
but they kept it along
a specific route.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.037 align:middle line:84%
When it got to Europe, it
was the Plantagenet bloodline

00:07:11.037 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that is still ruling
the planet to this day.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.586 align:middle line:84%
Now, Plantagenet bloodline
is John Lackland's line.

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.085 align:middle line:10%
John Lackland is
the King of England

00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:10%
that signed the Magna Carta.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:19.771 align:middle line:10%
But every single--

00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: King John from--

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: From the
Robin Hood legend.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:10%
And every president of the
United States of America

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:10%
is related to John Lackland,
and that Plantagenet bloodline,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:10%
which goes back to the
Arabian kings, which goes back

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.673 align:middle line:10%
to the Egyptian pharaohs, which
then goes back to the Sumerian

00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.371 align:middle line:10%
kings list in Iraq.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for a minute.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The only one president that is
not related to that bloodline

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is Van Buren.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So if we look at the
nature of Anunnaki society,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about
the Pyramid Wars,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.639 align:middle line:84%
obviously the rivalry that
existed between various blood--

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
even though they were half
brothers, for example, Enki,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were half
brothers, but there

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
is a rivalry between them,
and then their children

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.906 align:middle line:84%
obviously having a
rivalry between them,

00:07:56.906 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and how the children
are essentially

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:90%
lording over different cities.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.935 align:middle line:84%
Each city took on
a personal god.

00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
What can we understand
about the nature

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening on Earth?

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
To say that it
doesn't seem like it's

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:84%
just one faction that's
in total control.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It does seem more of, yes,
there are secret societies

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and elites, but it doesn't seem
that there always only getting

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:90%
what they want.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.468 align:middle line:84%
There does seem to be
a bit of a conflict

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and a bit of a power struggle
between the various elite

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Illuminati, if you
want to call it.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
How would you say
that we can learn

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.700 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening on Earth
and the power struggle on Earth

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.879 align:middle line:90%
based on Anunnaki society?

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, yeah.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:90%
It goes all the way back.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the biblical
times, you have Cain and Abel,

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you can go
forward from there.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.856 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
Palestine and Israel.

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you go
up in time, you just

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
see these scenarios where you
have this conflict going on.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.976 align:middle line:10%
In the book of
Deuteronomy in the Bible,

00:08:44.976 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:10%
when you really analyze
it and break it down,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:10%
you begin to realize that
these wars that are going on

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:10%
in Deuteronomy are actually
individual gods, were

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:10%
relatives, in different cities
sending human beings out,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:10%
kind of like we do now, to
war against other cities

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:10%
that they've never been to, to
destroy and pillage and bring

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:10%
back the riches and
so forth and so on.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So that this particular
entity or this god

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
can take over that land and
now he's expanded his kingdom.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And this has been so embedded
into the human culture,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.416 align:middle line:84%
this style or this technique of
conquer, divide, and acquire,

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you still have these
bloodlines, which are still

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.234 align:middle line:90%
here, even down the line.

00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:84%
They're down the line,
but they're still here,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and they still have the same
mentality, the same concept.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The concept is to
use humans as cattle,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.544 align:middle line:84%
send them out, conquer,
divide, and acquire.

00:09:30.544 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're just battling
each other back and forth.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
secret societies

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.404 align:middle line:90%
warring against each other.

00:09:37.404 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
ones really right

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
now currently is you have the
Rothschilds and Rockefellers

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and then you have George Soros.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
He has his own little
society, and then

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
you have the Rockefellers,
they go head to head.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Soros has done so many
undermining things to them,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and they've done so many
undermining things to him.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They've both crashed
economies just

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
on their own word and
decisions that they've

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.698 align:middle line:90%
made in banking and so forth.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But they're in a
little battle as well.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And even George Soros is in a
battle with the United States,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
an undermining
battle, where he does

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
things to undermine the United
States dollar and things

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So those secret wars, or
behind the scenes wars,

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
are still going on
until this very day.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What can we learn
about the Illuminati

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
from Anunnaki religion?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the Illuminati is
interesting in the sense

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that we know from
Weishaupt's intentions,

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
people will actually say, look,
actually he's very positive.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
revolution against kings

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.445 align:middle line:84%
and against organized
religion, and basically he's

00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
talking about freeing
people's thought

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and having to do this obviously
through secret societies

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
because of the
nature of the time.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted free thought at
the time of the Inquisition,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.340 align:middle line:84%
obviously they would
kill you for this.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So what can we say about
the nature of the Illuminati

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
as far as is it
sort of an extension

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of any kind of Anunnaki
religion or maybe in opposition

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
to Anunnaki religion?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The Illuminati
is an extension

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of the mystery schools,
which started way

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:90%
before Egypt even existed.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.679 align:middle line:90%
It was from the Land of Khem.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:84%
In the Emerald Tablets, the
first thing that Thoth does

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
it starts on Atlantis,
the actual island itself.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Thoth's dad sends him
to the Land of Khem.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
He gets in his ship,
and he says he rises up

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.209 align:middle line:84%
and then he actually
lands on Khem.

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
When he gets out,
there's barbarians.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.225 align:middle line:84%
His job is to bring them to a
higher level of civilization.

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
From there, when they
get to a certain level,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
he opens up the
Mystery Schools and he

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:84%
begins to teach these people
the higher things, dimensions,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.565 align:middle line:84%
technology, quantum physics, all
the stuff that they need know,

00:11:26.565 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
the universe and
everything else.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:90%
How things work.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Even to a higher level,
talking about even

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
manipulating the ether through
vibrations and thought.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So these Mystery
Schools maintained

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years, and
they were for invitation only,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
but they were for
enlightenment of the race.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Over time, as some of these
gods left and disappeared,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
like Thoth, for example, after
he was gone, he became a deity.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't a deity
when he was here.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:90%
He was a deity after he left.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And many years after
he left, and then

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, the
Pyramid priests figured out,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
oh, wow, we can use this
as a control method.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was the beginning
of one of the very first

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
secret societies was
the Mystery Schools.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
When the gods left, and
when Thoth left, Enki left,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
it was, OK, now we
can manipulate this.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We can use this on
the people, and they

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
began using it
against the people

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
for many different things, and
it evolved over many years.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So even though the
Illuminati maybe started up

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
as another branch
to say, we need

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.002 align:middle line:84%
to do this because we're trying
to create our own revolution,

00:12:23.002 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
but then again, it
always turns out

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.418 align:middle line:84%
to be the same thing,
control and manipulation.

00:12:26.418 --> 00:12:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Same with religion.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Same with politics.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It always turns into
a control factor.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And in
terms of religion,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
obviously we've heard
people proclaim that we're

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:90%
reaching the end times, right?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of symbols around
the nature of the trumpets are

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
flaring and we're entering
revelations, and then

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.447 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing about
Russia and China.

00:12:47.447 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a conflict
with Russia and China,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.549 align:middle line:84%
the US being part of
this Book of Revelation.

00:12:53.549 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
this is basically

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
a script that's being played
out as according to what's

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:84%
been set down by the
controllers of religion, to say

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the idea is to create
basically another nuclear war

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of genocidal
thing to get rid

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of large parts of
the population?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's possible, but I
have little slightly different

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:90%
take on it.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of these
wars are all fabricated

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
I say fabricated,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that people aren't
dying and fighting because they

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:90%
are fighting and dying.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.188 align:middle line:84%
But even if you go
back to the Civil War,

00:13:21.188 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
you discover that it
was funded on both sides

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:90%
by the same group.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And every war thereafter,
including World War I,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.575 align:middle line:84%
World War II, the Vietnam
War, that was a whole lie,

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the Gulf of Tonkin lie that
started the whole Viet-- it's

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
all about profits,
money, and control,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the people
fighting each other.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.792 align:middle line:84%
And they really see
human beings as cattle.

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't care if we
destroy each other,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.125 align:middle line:84%
wipe each other out
to a certain point.

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:45.902 align:middle line:84%
They'll pull back when they need
to keep a specific amount here.

00:13:45.902 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into the
ancient Sumerian text,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
you find that Enlil himself,
when the people started

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
getting too loud and too
obnoxious, he would say,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:90%
cull the humans.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Cull them.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Put a plague out there.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They had weather
control, because he said,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:90%
dry the fields out.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:90%
No food.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
No food will grow
for a year or two,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.961 align:middle line:90%
and he'd kill them off that way.

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They'd send people to these
wars that didn't make any sense,

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
so they had the ability
to do this back then,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's still progressing
into this current day.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's going
to be a nuclear war that

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.964 align:middle line:84%
will end everything, because
they're not that dumb.

00:14:15.964 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think, based
on what I've seen

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
in 2010 from the Disclosure
Project, which actually

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
broadcasted live on CNN, you
had all those military soldiers

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
from the 1960s and '70s
come forward, and say

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that these UFOs came
to the missile silos

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and turned off the nukes.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think we're
going to see a nuclear war.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's
a lot of theater,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.971 align:middle line:84%
and that theater generates
revenue for those countries.

00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But if there's theater,
there's also a real rivalry,

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and that begs the question of
who do you think is in charge?

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Is it Enki or Enlil or
any of their children

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.209 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately believes that
they have the mantle of--

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
tablets of destiny, for
example, the mantle of kingship

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.708 align:middle line:90%
over the Earth at this point?

00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:58.192 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's actually Amun-Ra,
who is Marduk, Thoth's brother.

00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Because during the last
Pyramid War, he was defeated.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he
took that too well.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
He had to escape, number
one, and during his escape,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
right before he decided to
leave and like rule from space,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
is what he basically
says, he actually

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
turned over the riches of
the kingdom to the rakam.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The rakam means
offspring of, and when

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
you translate the word kam,
K-A-M, into more modern terms,

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
the word kam is shield.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So he transferred the
riches and the rulership

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.299 align:middle line:84%
of this Earth and the
kingdom to the Ra shields.

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's who's running the
planet till this very day.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And a lot of
inner fighting, as I

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:84%
understand it, between even
within that family itself.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But you talk about the nature
of war as profiting countries.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we know
that it's been

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
tremendous for the
amount of national debt

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately goes back
to the private banks that

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
are behind the central
banking system itself.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So these wars are tremendous
for putting people into debt,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.519 align:middle line:84%
but is there
something else that's

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:90%
part of the design for the war?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking maybe things
like ritual sacrifice,

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and how would blood
sacrifice play

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
into the design of conflict.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: These elites are
vary into blood sacrifice,

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and these rituals, like
the Bohemian Grove rituals,

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
where they worship the owl and
do these sacrifices out there.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're real or
not, I don't really know.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
they're doing them.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.827 align:middle line:84%
But it seems so weird that
a lot of these leaders

00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and these rules and
these elite people

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
are so much into
this sacrifice stuff,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost as if
they are on a time scale

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
with these, like every
so many years or months,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
they start these problems, or,
I guess, you want to call it,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.934 align:middle line:90%
issues with other countries.

00:16:34.934 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They have an issue
with embargoes,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.391 align:middle line:84%
they have an issue with
trade, they have an issue

00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with-- they move warships
into certain areas

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to trigger certain responses
from other countries.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
a sudden, we have

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
a situation that breaks out.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, a lot of people
die, and for whatever reason,

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
these elite people get a
satisfaction out of it.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
I looked at some
of the politicians.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can name
their names in America that

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
have ordered drone
strikes on people,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and have killed literally
millions of innocent civilians

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
in other countries.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.117 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: As far as the actual
controllers within the system,

00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day, we're
talking about the managers,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
the politicians, the
bankers, the military men,

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.653 align:middle line:84%
they don't really seem like that
they themselves run the system.

00:17:18.653 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they're part
of it, but aren't they

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
also enslaved by the
system themselves?

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.935 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the biggest
things that a lot of people

00:17:24.935 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
don't realize is not only
are we the prisoners,

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
but we're also
the prison guards.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody really
understands what that means,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and they go, oh my
god, you're right.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.789 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
governing ourselves,

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's like the
crab in the bucket.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.413 align:middle line:84%
When you have one crab try
to climb out of bucket,

00:17:41.413 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the other crabs grab it and
pull it right back down again.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the
whole police system,

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.704 align:middle line:84%
we have the military system,
we have the political system,

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and all these systems are
designed to keep all of us

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
in check, including
them, because they've

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.278 align:middle line:90%
got to follow orders as well.

00:17:56.278 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
If they don't follow
orders, then they lose out.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, some of the
ones at the higher levels, they

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
sell themselves out
to enrich themselves.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.143 align:middle line:84%
They literally sell
out the human race

00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
to enrich themselves
knowing that this

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
damage, trauma,

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and even destroy
the environment.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But because they're at a
higher, more comfortable level,

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be OK with them.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, we're still

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:90%
all on the same playing ground.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
There's still
somebody above them,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe
it potentially

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
could be Amun-Ra, who's
also named Marduk,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
still running the show
from behind the scenes.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.332 align:middle line:84%
Because he had to
escape out of here.

00:18:30.332 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he
took it that well.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
He already had took a war,
according to the text,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.961 align:middle line:84%
to take over earlier
than he was supposed to.

00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Before his constellation arose,
he took over a little early,

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and that caused a lot of battles
between him and his brother.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And he actually ended
up, Thoth ended up

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
leaving Egypt
because of Amun-Ra.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
They were fighting too much.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But part of the sadism
makes me wonder, obviously,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
we hear a lot accounts
about demons and about--

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.282 align:middle line:84%
there's a spiritual
dimension, ghosts, the idea

00:18:58.282 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing sacrifices,
but ultimately, these spirits

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:84%
have to go somewhere,
and maybe they

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
are feeding into
a demonic energy.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.376 align:middle line:84%
How did the demons play
into the Anunnaki story?

00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it would not
necessarily be the same thing.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.396 align:middle line:84%
Demons can be separate
from these sky gods.

00:19:10.396 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
What they did was they
manipulated the whole--

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Enlil was the one behind it.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
People began to realize that
Enki and Thoth were really

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
helping mankind and taking
them to another level,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and they would go around
really helping people.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.799 align:middle line:90%
Enlil despised that.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want any interaction.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want people
helping any humans.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It made him an enemy
of his own relatives.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
He began to call Enki, Satan
and the devil, and so forth.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who actually
is the evil person,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.637 align:middle line:84%
but then tried to flip
it on his own relatives,

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and make it say that
they were the serpents,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and they were the evil devils,
and so forth and so on.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But now, when it comes to a
lot of these rituals, what

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.866 align:middle line:84%
the rituals are
really doing, it's

00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
not that so much that
you're pulling entities

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:90%
out of other dimensions.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
words have power,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is why we call it
spelling, S-P-E-L-L dash ING,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:90%
because we're casting spells.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Every word we speak,
literally casts a spell.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Every book you read
is casting a spell.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:90%
They think, this sounds evil.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
No, but it's not.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Even when you
pray, you're trying

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to cast a spell in your favor.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So words have power because
they create a vibration

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and that vibration and frequency
has control over the ether.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It's already been proven.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Frequency and vibration
make everything we see.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It creates our reality tunnels.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So what these people
are doing when

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.855 align:middle line:84%
they start doing these rituals
and doing all these chants

00:20:25.855 --> 00:20:28.487 align:middle line:84%
and things, it's because
they're trying to make--

00:20:28.487 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to create a new
tunnel through the actual ether

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:90%
itself to benefit themselves.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
creating something

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:84%
within the universal
consciousness that actually

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
creates something
in their own reality

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:90%
that actually they can manifest.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.316 align:middle line:84%
Thoth talks about this
in the Emerald Tablets,

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
where he actually is able to
manifest bricks and stone out

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.465 align:middle line:84%
of speech and vibration
from his own voice.

00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do we have
any indication

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
that Enki and sort of the more
positive side of the Anunnaki

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
are trying to basically reassert
any influence over Marduk

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and Enlil?

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.173 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I haven't
seen anything yet.

00:21:01.173 --> 00:21:03.489 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some things
that Thoth is coming back,

00:21:03.489 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
or that he's here
now, and he's going

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to try to work with his dad
and try to bring things back

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the
ancient texts always

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:90%
talk about them coming back.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They've always said
they're coming back.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.966 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seems like they've
been gone for a long time,

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking
about human lifespans.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
If somebody can live
for over 100,000 years,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.511 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing but a
blink of an eye for them

00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
if they leave for 400
years, 1,000 years.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.005 align:middle line:84%
They just went
around the corner.

00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can't really
perceive time in that way,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but it seems as if we're really
overdue for some help here.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I would open my heart
to some help right now.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: One place that seems
to be very relevant to indicate

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:90%
the ancient past is Antarctica.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:10%
The Piri Reis Map indicates
Antarctica obviously

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:10%
always wasn't covered, or
wasn't always covered by ice.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:10%
Then there's this
whole new theory

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:10%
that part of the reason
for some nuclear weapon

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:10%
deployments that the
US has been doing,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:10%
or at least did
during the Cold War,

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:10%
was actually to
artificially warm the ice,

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:10%
and essentially start to access
natural resources in the South

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:10%
Pole.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it's
beyond natural resources?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about discovering
ancient cities or indications

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:90%
of the Anunnaki civilization?

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that Antarctica
is just an amazing place.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.792 align:middle line:90%
I tell everybody.

00:22:18.792 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Please go on Google Earth
and go to Antarctica,

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because you can see that
almost every country has

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.006 align:middle line:90%
a base in Antarctica right now.

00:22:26.006 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
a neutral zone.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.374 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
I'm your worst enemy,

00:22:29.374 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't shoot you,
kill you, attack you,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:90%
or kill you in Antarctica.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a free zone.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But they're all there doing
these top secret projects,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and working on the same thing.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the case may be.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I do really feel-- because
back in the early days,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:84%
we would set off nuclear
bombs for anything just

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.576 align:middle line:90%
to see what we can do.

00:22:45.576 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
We tried to open up the
atmosphere to release radiation

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.817 align:middle line:90%
by blowing up a bomb in space.

00:22:51.817 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see any
reason why they wouldn't

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:90%
have tried to blow up a bomb.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
We blew up a little island
in the middle of the Pacific

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:90%
just to do a test.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.017 align:middle line:84%
So they probably did blow up
some regions of Antarctica

00:23:01.017 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to try to break some
of that ice away,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.099 align:middle line:84%
and see if they
could make maybe can

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
find an entrance, or also,
find out what's there,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:90%
some technology.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:10%
Because they probably already
did a scan of the area,

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:10%
and said, OK, there's
something so many meters down,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.077 align:middle line:10%
or so many miles down.

00:23:13.077 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's take this top
layer off, and see

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:90%
if we can start to get to it.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible
that they did that.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's a
lot of artifacts there.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
on Google Earth,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:90%
you see gigantic ancient bases.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:10%
They'd have to be,
because these stone

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:10%
walls are so old
and so dilapidated,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:10%
but they're super megalithic.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So once again, this
is not normal masonry.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:10%
These are gigantic blocks.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about blocks that
would rival the pyramid blocks.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to say, OK,
did the Nazis build this?

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think they would have

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.779 align:middle line:90%
built a megalithic structure.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I think they
built some stuff there,

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think that they're
maybe still there.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that they build

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:90%
those megalithic structures.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Of course,
it begs the question

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of why the Nazis were in
Antarctica in the first place.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Why did they want to build
Neuschwabenland in the poles.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They had
been chasing down

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
every piece of ancient
texts and ancient relic.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:90%
They went to Tibet.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They went everywhere all over
this world scouring this planet

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
for all this
ancient information,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to know
how to create things out

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:90%
of the ether.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know how to
create vimanas that could fly,

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to get
a hold of these people.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
they made contact

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:84%
with these pre-Adamite
people, and maybe

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
some of these Pleiadian
type, Tall Whites,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
or whatever down
there, and I really

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:84%
think that they got accepted,
for whatever reason,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
these people seemed to
me have helped them,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even accepted
them into the society.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.164 align:middle line:84%
And some of them may have
still been there all this time.

00:24:36.164 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So do you
think that there

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:84%
is potential entry into the
Inner Earth through the poles?

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's
no doubt about it.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You can see them from
the Google Earth.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You can see gigantic,
massive openings.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Some are several
kilometers wide.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:90%
They go right in.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
There's been accounts of
military pilots flying

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:90%
into some of these openings.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:10%
Corey Goode does a great job
explaining one of the openings,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:10%
from his own
experience, that he saw

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.690 align:middle line:10%
this massive underground
city that went on for miles.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: And is this where
some of the Anunnaki

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:10%
could have gone?

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:10%
Some of the Enki and
Thoth type of figures

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:10%
would have gone,
to the Inner Earth?

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.288 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: It's very possible.

00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Sumerian
tablets, when Enki gets here,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Enlil builds his
mansion above ground.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And Enki actually uses a
tool to drill into the ground

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and builds a complete palace
deep in the Earth innards,

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.512 align:middle line:90%
it says.

00:25:21.512 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So it is very possible.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.262 align:middle line:84%
They're used to living
underground already,

00:25:24.262 --> 00:25:26.928 align:middle line:84%
so it's very possible that there
still could be something there.

00:25:26.928 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:10%
I remember Phil Schneider in
the '80s had come forward.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:10%
He was a US military
geologist that

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.499 align:middle line:10%
was helping with an underground
base, and one layer broke free

00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:10%
and they fell into this
underground chamber

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:10%
where there was an
alien base of some sort.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:84%
He didn't recognize
them as human,

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and even a war broke
out where he was shot

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and his hand was sliced with
these kind of laser slicing,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.514 align:middle line:84%
and his body was
kind of cut open.

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And he lived for a little while
after, but eventually died

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:90%
from his wounds.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.469 align:middle line:84%
But he was one of
the first people

00:25:54.469 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to really come out
and say, look, I'm

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:90%
a geologist for the military.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I opened this area up, and
there were people down there.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And as far
as Antarctica goes,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:84%
you've mentioned in
your work that there's

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
a correlation of structures
between Antarctica

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and the structures you've
seen there and Mars, as far

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:90%
as the anomalies are concerned.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, yeah.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a super massive
pyramid in Antarctica.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean super massive.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And some military
soldiers have come forward

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and talked actually
to Linda Moulton

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Howe with their
testimony about the fact

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that it's still emitting
some type of exotic energy.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have
all the leaders

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of the world have
gone down there,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
everybody from the Queen of
England, to Donald Trump,

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
to Obama.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.437 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's gone
to this location.

00:26:37.437 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
More recently, Buzz Aldrin went
there, one of the first people

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.059 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the moon,
and he was completely

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
horrified at what he found out.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:10%
He actually went
on Twitter and made

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.998 align:middle line:10%
a tweet that said something
to the effect of they are

00:26:46.998 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:10%
pure evil and we're in trouble.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Within four or five hours,
it had gotten deleted.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.182 align:middle line:10%
But the tweet,
luckily, was obviously

00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:10%
saved by millions of
people, so we can probably

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:10%
find that very easily.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:90%
But he did make that tweet.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Then they said he was sick, and
then they extradited him out

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:90%
of there immediately.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But there are massive
megalithic walls there,

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
there's pyramids there, and
there's massive openings

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.270 align:middle line:84%
by these megalithic walls
to the inside of somewhere.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:14.415 align:middle line:90%
How deep they go, I don't know?

00:27:14.415 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's safe to
say that there's definitely

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
something down there
worthwhile, because why would

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:84%
all the countries of the world
spend all that energy, money,

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.530 align:middle line:84%
finances, and research
to stay down there?

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Indeed.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So on the whole, we talked
about obviously the notion

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that potentially Enki and this
sort of more positive side

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of the Anunnaki might be
stepping forward in the future

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to sort of make their
presence more felt,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:84%
or to start to shift away
from the influence of Marduk

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Enlil faction,
but what is it ultimately

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that you think
the Anunnaki still

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%
want with humans at this point?

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that the ones that
are here, believe it or not,

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:90%
there's a rumor that--

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.158 align:middle line:84%
it's not even really
a rumor, but I

00:27:59.158 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
guess it is a hypothesis,
that some of them

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
got stuck here after
the last Pyramid War.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Some chose to stay.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I say stuck here,
because after your own planet

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.804 align:middle line:84%
with this gravity
versus your home planet,

00:28:10.804 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
which supposedly was
four or six times larger,

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're here for so many
thousands of years, millennia,

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
your body then adjusts
to this gravity.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost impossible for
you to go back and sustain

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:90%
a normal life on that planet.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
When astronauts come
back, just from being

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.754 align:middle line:84%
in space for a little
while, they can barely walk.

00:28:27.754 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if it was millennia
that they were up there,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
and then came back.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:84%
They'd be completely
disintegrated.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So their bodies had gotten
used to the Earth's gravity,

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and I think that some of
them had already taken wives,

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:90%
and they decided to stay.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the bloodlines
who are told about the truth,

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.836 align:middle line:84%
they want to make it
back to the stars.

00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think ultimately,
what's happening

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
is human beings are still
being used as cattle,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're a
means to their end,

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and their end is to use us
to get all the resources,

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:90%
to get all the finances--

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.101 align:middle line:84%
even though it's fake money,
but to generate enough resources

00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
through that
method, that system,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that they can work on
the secret space program,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and they can get themselves back
out into the space and stars.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But the notion being that
they lost the technology

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
They had the technology to
travel, and they lost that.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They lost
it, absolutely.

00:29:14.538 --> 00:29:17.727 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example, let's
say we have a spaceship,

00:29:17.727 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:90%
and we travel to another planet.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We crash land.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, then we have--

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.715 align:middle line:84%
our kids are there with
us, and they go on,

00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and they mate and everything,
and they have more kids.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.093 align:middle line:84%
And by the second
or third generation,

00:29:27.093 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that wreck is just
a piece of metal.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.947 align:middle line:90%
It means nothing.

00:29:29.947 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have no technology
to get off their planet.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have a way to
make a screen or a cell phone

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They've got to start
literally from zero.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that after
that last Pyramid War

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.862 align:middle line:84%
and when the Anunnaki
did leave, they

00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:42.861 align:middle line:84%
took a lot of the technology
they had with them.

00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They cleaned house down here.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
They took stuff out
of the Great Pyramid.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.714 align:middle line:84%
They buried entire cities
that were advanced cities.

00:29:49.714 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
They just found
another 300 or 400

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
buried pyramids right
in the sands of Giza.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:90%
These cities are buried.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.854 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this sand is
imported and dumped there,

00:29:57.854 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's many
places around the world

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:90%
like that this has happened.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
they're in the process,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
or having in the
process, over millennia

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.657 align:middle line:90%
of getting back to space.

00:30:08.657 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:84%
To us, again, it seems
like a long period of time,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.099 align:middle line:90%
but to them, it's just--

00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:13.890 align:middle line:84%
even if it's generational,
they don't care.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.945 align:middle line:84%
It's a mission that I
believe that they're on.

00:30:15.945 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the whole secret behind the
33rd degree Masons, the biggest

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:84%
secret behind it all,
besides all the mysteries

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, the
biggest secret is space travel.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
leave the planet Earth,

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
you have to travel 33
times the speed of sound

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:90%
to leave this planet.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.382 align:middle line:10%
And that's the biggest secret of
them all that's behind the 33--

00:30:35.382 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:10%
it's about getting
off this planet.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting
back into the stars.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.115 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: It's fascinating.

00:30:40.115 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating insights.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Billy, for your time.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I appreciate it.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And there
you have it, folks.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:84%
