let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore the
twilight zones of reality.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and joining me today

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
is Major Ed Dames, the world's
foremost remote viewing

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
teacher.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
He's a decorated military
intelligence officer

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and an original member of the
US Army prototype Remote Viewing

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Training Program.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
He served as both training
and operations officer

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
for the US government's top
secret Psychic Espionage Unit.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So, Major Dames,
I have to ask you

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to start, psychic
espionage, how did your unit

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
come into existence,
and what did it do?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ED DAMES: Well,
basically two reasons why--

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
the genesis of the unit was that
it was a tactic of desperation,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.204 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get into
that momentarily.

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:10%
But the other reason was
the Russians were doing it.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLE]

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:10%
No, no, really,
seriously, the Russians

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:10%
were doing it, so we
had to do too because we

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
didn't want them to scoop us.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:10%
So that's how we started a
program at Stanford Research

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:10%
Institute, now
SRI International,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:10%
to study the very,
very gifted psychics,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:10%
their cognitive behavior
when they were on target.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And we did that.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
We modeled it,
and that model was

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
taught to military
officers like myself.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to take that
discovery in the laboratory

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
into the deep, dark
world of intelligence

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and massage it into a useful
information collection tool

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that we could use to develop
intelligence products.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The tactic of desperation
part, at the time

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of the unit's
formative days, I was

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.945 align:middle line:84%
at very high levels of
the US Intel, Office

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:90%
of the Secretary of Defense.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So my job as a targeting
officer, a science

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and technology
targeting officer,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
was to choose our
targets, particularly

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
biological warfare, very
classified, top secret Russian

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and Chinese targets, where
we couldn't penetrate them.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I had all these tools
at my disposal, agents

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, very
exotic technologies,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't get
into these programs.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was read-on, briefed,
about the existence

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
of this experimental unit,
a remote viewing unit.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I started to use
their information

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to cross-queue my other
systems to tip off satellites

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and other agents to
look in certain places.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to
finally gain a foothold

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
into these very, very
secret Soviet programs,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons programs,
biological warfare programs,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of things.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I became so
enthralled with this unit,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I stepped down from these
celestial levels of Intel

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.715 align:middle line:84%
to take over as operations
and training officer.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was a 33 or so years
ago, and I'm still doing it.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But not for the
government currently.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I've done some
counterterrorist work

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.965 align:middle line:84%
for the Russian
government recently.

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It helped them catch a
jihadi terrorist that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
planning on blowing up a stadium
for the upcoming World Cup,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't done any
work for the US military,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
just for FBI and
local law enforcement.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so the work that you
are doing with the US military,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
going back over 30
years, was basically

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the psychic espionage,
meaning like remote viewing.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You'd basically have a
team working in a room

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
they would work on
visualizing a location,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.947 align:middle line:90%
or how did it actually work out?

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I was also
the training officer,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
so I had to train the officers
and enlisted personnel

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:90%
in this technology.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And that training took
about six months to do.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So today I train students to
work alone, completely alone,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:90%
but then we used monitors.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So as a training officer,
afterwards I became a monitor.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would give one of the
officers a blind target,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
for instance a scud missile
launcher in a Czech forest

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, to be able
to describe this,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
if it had any new warheads
or something like that,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and they would not know
what the target is.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Their unconscious has been
taught to do all the work.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Conscious is one that says
out of the problem set.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a three part process,
setting up the target,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
conducting a remote
viewing session

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
itself-- your eyes are
open, and you are awake.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Although we used altered
states in the past--

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and analyzing the data.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's rather complex, but
it is very, very rigorous.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing avails itself of
this natural, innate, psychic

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:90%
faculty that we're born with.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I think most of
your viewers would

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
agree that animals and
people are born psychically.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So we take this
faculty, and we develop

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
into a skill, a very, very
rigorous, systematic skill.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: How much did the
MKUltra mind control programs

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.945 align:middle line:84%
play into the origin of the
psychic espionage programs?

00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: None.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
MKUltra and all that, that was
all chemical-induced states.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
A remote viewing there's
no mind-expanding drugs.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The Russian GRU, the Soviet
military intelligence,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
they tried to use Halcion,
LSD, mind-expanding drugs.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is,
if you use Halcion or LSD,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:90%
it is mind expanding.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of the
process that we have,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
it's an attention-management
tool, a mind-control tool.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to be in
absolute control of what

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
we pass back and forth
through our superconscious,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
our unconscious.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that with-- well,
think of a modem on a computer.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
If you take the modem
away, your laptop

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
has access to the
entire internet at once,

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
so there's no management
that's possible.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:90%
You're overwhelmed.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
That's analogous,
I think, to what

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
a mind-expanding drug does.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
When you try to induce an
altered state for information

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:84%
collection reasons,
it can't work.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they killed a couple
of young troops doing this.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.647 align:middle line:84%
We know that from
inside information.

00:06:27.647 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And there was no origin.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the
Russians were doing it.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But what about some of the
things about the Nazis,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.634 align:middle line:84%
with the Vril women for
example, who had the long hair,

00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were said
to be channels?

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.174 align:middle line:84%
And were there other
indications the Nazis had ever

00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
used any psychic espionage?

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I think many
of your listeners

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
know about the Ahnenerbe,
Hitler's occult forces too.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But the way we work has
nothing to do with that.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It's dry, but it's
very, very exacting.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
While we're working, we
are not allowed to think.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
There's no thinking
allowed whatsoever,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
no running analysis.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:90%
If you even stop for a moment--

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like playing the piano,
you do not think about the note

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that you just played
or the note stops.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a pace in the
cadence for each one

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
of the stages in our
work, about 45 minutes

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to 2 hours with breaks
if we need them,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and we can come back
to the target over,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and over, and over again
and collect as much detail

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
as we want.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So did your work in
realm of the psychic realm

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
affect your belief systems
about the 3D realm?

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that things that
we do psychically or, let's

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
say, in other
dimensions of reality

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:90%
can affect this reality?

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Yes, it
changed my life,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
not only with regard to the
idea that you can know anything

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
with remote viewing,
within limits

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that we could discuss
the technical,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
but our sister science is PK,
psychokinesis, telekinesis,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:90%
moving things mind over matter.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was
use remote viewing

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to model the
psychokinesis process.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you develop a model for
PK, you can teach that as well.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is consciousness,
consciousness tools.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
That, as far as I'm
concerned, that's the future.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So your unit
was also decommissioned?

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Yes, it became a real
hot potato, white elephant.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
For instance, at Defense
Intelligence Agency,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
where I was operations
and training officer,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
three star generals in
charge of the agency

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
did not want to be associated
with the paranormal

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and the occult. We
had replicability.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
We were very, very
functional and useful

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of operations,
but there was no theory.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
We did not meet the
Western scientific method,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.249 align:middle line:84%
which requires replicability
as well as a theory.

00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese don't have
to worry about this.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We can discuss that
if you want, but they

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
were afraid of their careers.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into star ranks,
you start to become political.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that there's any
problem with you understanding

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they did not
want to be associated

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:90%
with something like this.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we were sent back to
the Army, then somewhere else,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and finally, it was disbanded.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But given
that, as you said,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this effect
upon physical reality,

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
telekinesis things
like this, as you say,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
are very important
to our future.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think
that this maybe went

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to the black sector
of what's considered

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
like sort of black box,
black budget operations?

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: We were black budget.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I was in black units
for most of my career.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But could have
gone somewhere else

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and you wouldn't know?

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, I would have known,
and I'm the keeper of the keys.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I evolved this.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I'm being
closely watched,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to need this again.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But for the moment, I'm
the only game in town.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So as far as the
official world of intelligence,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it's NSA,
CIA, military, you

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
would say that there's no
real exploration going on

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:14.167 align:middle line:84%
of psychic effects upon physical
reality, Jedi-type of work?

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: There is
with subcontractors.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we operate.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
DOD doesn't have the license
or charter to study UFOs

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and the paranormal.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So what they'll do is
take a defense contractor,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
a beltway bandit, and
have them study it.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.062 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, some of
that's going on.

00:10:33.062 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Exactly as
recently was appointed

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
by the Defense
Department working

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
with guys like Robert Bigelow to
study the UFO phenomenon right?

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Well, I know Bob.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But, again, I mean,
I know part of your interest

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.572 align:middle line:90%
is the alien question.

00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It's the
spice of life for me.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll return to that.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I have bucket list of some
very practical law enforcement

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
problems I have to
take care of first,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:90%
but, yeah, I'll return to that.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:10%
I spent a lot of time-- even
in the field, the former Crown

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:10%
Prince of Liechtenstein,
Hans-Adam von Lichtenstein,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:10%
sponsored the project
that I had years ago.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We used remote viewing to find
a UFO hot zone in Chaco Canyon.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:10%
And I got to select some of
the US's finest scientists

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:10%
and engineers.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The crown-prince
came out with me,

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and we set up equipment
there to try to get a CE3.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
We got CE2s, flybys,
but they wouldn't land.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Years later, we found out
why using remote viewing.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Project Blue Book, 10
working hypotheses,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
all failed but using remote
viewing and consciousness

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
tools, we can get inside of
that other entities agenda.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.427 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, that's
a whole lot of fun.

00:11:50.427 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So when the
Defense Department

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
talks about-- basically
it's leaked that the Defense

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Department has been spending
money studying the UFO

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, does this
indicate that our military,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.346 align:middle line:84%
that basically the
establishment figures really

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think there
is a relationship?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: They have no idea
in the world what's going on.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.667 align:middle line:84%
A remote viewing unit,
as an operations officer,

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you can go back and
look at the records that

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:90%
have been released.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how much
work I did with my team

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:84%
against the UFO
problem set and what

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
we learned from that,
which was a whole lot more

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:84%
than traditional DOD tools and
apparatus could ever obtain.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, what did you
learn about the ET phenomenon

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.114 align:middle line:84%
through your work into
psychiatric research?

00:12:36.114 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, that would
take weeks and weeks

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
and weeks as a data dump.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
There is a federation
out there, and we're not

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
in it, as the late
George Carlin would say.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And the way to get in it is
not to try to second guess

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that lower levels
of the federation,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
but to look to see if
they would allow Homo

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
sapiens to become a member.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:90%
But what are their protocols?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Not what do we think we
should do to gain members,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
shoot one down with a
0.50 cal or whatever.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
How should we meet?

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And look at their protocols.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And because
consciousness, I believe,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is the lingua franca for
so many different species

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and types of lifeform,
the commonality

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
is not math or gravity.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
So these consciousness
tools really become

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:90%
the foundation for contact.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And looking into the various
different entities that

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
are out there
observing us, what are

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:90%
their protocols for contact?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that we're
not mature enough, generally

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%
speaking, to have contact.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't want anything to
do with us; want to observe

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%
this madness down here.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you do display
an element of maturity,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their standards,
there will be contact.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking forward
to doing that again.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Would you
say that a lot of

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the extra terrestrial phenomenon
is actually interdimensional?

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Which is to say
that we contact them

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
more through the astral
than the physical planes?

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Well, that's
a misnomer actually.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's a non sequitur.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of the observed UFO
activity is interdimensional,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:90%
and they do have technology.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
They're based particularly
in seamounts under the sea.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Inside the seamount
is very, very deep,

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and they pop in and out
of that with technology.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
They are interdimensional
in nature.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:45.062 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Travis
Walton's experience--

00:14:45.062 --> 00:14:46.145 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: "Fire in the Sky?"

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:46.945 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yeah.

00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Those entities were
interdimensional.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of what we
see in the sky come and go

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
or orbs, the recently
released Department

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
of Defense
photography, those are

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional technologies.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.325 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
extraterrestrials,

00:15:04.325 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
there's other things
that are going on.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
For instance, crop
circles are formed

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
sentient machines, machines

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that were left behind by a race
and report back to their owners

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
periodically.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So, again, in terms
of the astral possibilities,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
working within the astral
realms of consciousness,

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.395 align:middle line:84%
is that the easiest
way to contact--

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, in
our work, anything

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
having to do with astral
travel, out-of-body experiences,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and things like that here,
it's not a mind tool.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual tool.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with remote viewing.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We tried to induce out-of-body
states in the unit.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And as operation, that's
very, very different modality

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
than sitting across the table
and watching a remote viewer

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in a darkened room,
I have to sit at a small table,

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and the training is
very, very different.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got to have a
subject laying in a bed.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
inside of biological warfare

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
plant in Russia using
an altered state.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But then they slip into an out
of body, and they're silent.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
in, and, sir, you

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.452 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't believe what happened.

00:16:23.452 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I was up here in the
ceiling looking down

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
at you working and
things like that.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm, Wilson?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Did you get the information
on the botulinum toxin?

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Sir, no, but you
should have seen.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of not useful,
so we abandoned that tact.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
True story.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But in the process of
these out-of-body experiences

00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and the astral journeys
were there ET contacts?

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.355 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: There was
one that killed--

00:16:49.355 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the former operations
officer for the Army unit,

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately, put one of--

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
because you have absolute
trust in your monitor

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:90%
when you do this.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
You're in an altered state,
and they're steering you.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The technology is difficult
to explain at the moment.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:90%
But they're steering you.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The former operations
officer put this guy inside

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
of that Travis Walton
particular vehicle.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't use the
term vehicle, object.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And there were five
entities inside there

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:90%
that did not look human at all.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So now he's bilocating.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It means that not all of
his conscious awareness,

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
but about 80% of it is now
inside that particular object,

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and he's trapped with these
five things, entities, there.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And he had a heart
attack and died.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.095 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Your guy did?

00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Yeah,
because he thought

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
he was going into another
top secret Russian laboratory

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
or directed energy facility
or something like that.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
the operations officer

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.254 align:middle line:84%
slipped him a mickey and
put him inside of a UFO.

00:17:53.254 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So how do you
know he was there?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.634 align:middle line:84%
He reported seeing
it and then he died?

00:17:57.634 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: The operations
officer gave him

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%
that as a particular target.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the trained
remote viewer.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Yeah, but did he
report back before dying?

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
He reported back
what he was seeing?

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Just momentarily.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.114 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
dead, heart attack.

00:18:11.114 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: There's obviously--
we talked about entities

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and extra terrestrials,
but also there's

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
guardian angels that
you would say that are

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.188 align:middle line:90%
real and being encountered.

00:18:21.188 --> 00:18:21.988 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:18:21.988 --> 00:18:23.935 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And what
is their signature?

00:18:23.935 --> 00:18:25.953 align:middle line:90%
And how do they function?

00:18:25.953 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: If you're looking
up what is their signature,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:90%
they're in another dimension.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They are mathematically
different.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your own guardian
angel, it's an oblique about 45

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
degrees behind you and
about six feet away.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
If it wanted to pop into this
reality in the material world,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that's where it would
come in, that vector.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to
protect you so that you

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
can achieve some
destiny rather than meet

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:90%
a fate, which most people do.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of you
interacting with them, no.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They interact with
you when they need to.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.689 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So it would seem
that this guy that basically

00:19:03.689 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
reported being inside the craft,
that had a heart attack from

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.776 align:middle line:84%
fear, presumably, from what he
saw with these alien beings--

00:19:09.776 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Did not have
a guardian angel.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.204 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, that
maybe was his destiny.

00:19:14.204 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I totally
agree with you.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it could have been.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because it seems that
you do believe that the future

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.903 align:middle line:84%
is fixed, that we essentially
cannot change that.

00:19:24.903 --> 00:19:27.095 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, I believe that
very, very large things,

00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:84%
the things that loom very
large in the future, stuff

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that the prophets of
old had seen, are fixed.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of epiphenomena,
these little things,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day life
and whether or not

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
you choose to eat at
this restaurant or that,

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.845 align:middle line:84%
is, for the most
part, not fixed.

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:44.645 align:middle line:90%
It's loose.

00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%
It's wiggly, fuzzy.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, so we have
basic benchmarks that

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:84%
have to be hit,
but in the journey

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.212 align:middle line:90%
to get there different roads.

00:19:53.212 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Sean, they
don't have to be hit.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:90%
They already exist in time.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:90%
They already exist in time.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
The mind is outside of time.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
When I remote view,
I have to have

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
temporal qualifiers to lock
in past, present, or future.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the mind looks down
on this broad panoply of events

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
through time.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Your life, for instance,
if I wanted to remote view

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
you or you wanted
to remote view me,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
then I have to dictate
to the superconscious

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that I want you in
the present time.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.635 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it can pick
you up wherever it wants.

00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:27.797 align:middle line:90%
Enter at the infant, a neonate--

00:20:27.797 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So are you time
traveling in a sense

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.904 align:middle line:90%
when you remote view?

00:20:30.904 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I don't like
the word traveling

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.847 align:middle line:84%
so much because we're
not going anywhere

00:20:34.847 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:90%
when we're remote viewing.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
All the information is
present in superconscious.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Our brain is an oscillator.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.215 align:middle line:84%
It's plugged in to the
global mind, universal minds.

00:20:43.215 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
it as the mind of God.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:90%
All the information is there.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And life is short, so we
have to pick our problem sets

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.442 align:middle line:84%
and what we want to study
carefully because there's

00:20:53.442 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
only so much time to do that.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But, no, we're really
not time traveling,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but we can see over the
horizon-wise into the future

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.384 align:middle line:90%
and certainly into the past.

00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, so
essentially it's

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.822 align:middle line:84%
as though all time
is present to us now.

00:21:06.822 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And essentially when people
talk about the Akashic records,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.154 align:middle line:84%
the idea of tapping into
the Akashic records,

00:21:11.154 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
you can basically
see past and future.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bird's-eye view, as
opposed to walking it where we

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:90%
are here on Earth.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.034 align:middle line:84%
We can't see as far
forward and backward.

00:21:19.034 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It's
something like that.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
linear time that we

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
have down here where the
rubber meets the road--

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
expressing an idea, if I want
to express an idea in English,

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
the concatenation
of subject, verb,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
object as I lead up
to my expression--

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
all that linear
time is an illusion.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
That's not the way
time really exists.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.928 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: So how does it exist?

00:21:42.928 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Time is real.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
We can't understand it.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand it.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't even understand
consciousness yet.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, what I
do, I do it well.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm the best that there
is, I think, right now

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
until I train others
to replace me.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But we don't understand
how we're doing it.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Really, we're going leave that
to the academicians to do that.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.506 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have a model.

00:22:03.506 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we couldn't
teach it, but we

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.338 align:middle line:90%
don't know how were doing it.

00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So because
it's so fuzzy--

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we know
from quantum physics

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
that when we become conscious
of things we affect them.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So how would you say psychic
espionage and potentially

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:84%
viewing other people's realities
could actually potentially

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:90%
affect their reality?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Could the effect have
consequence in their life?

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: It actually does.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.491 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
knowledge of something,

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
then you can act on that.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That's at the minor
level, the lower level.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
higher levels too,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
if you're interacting
with the inertia

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
thing, then there's

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
a gravitational field
around it that forms.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And as the Earth
moves, as it turns,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
this thing stays
the same way, and it

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:90%
looks like it moves this way.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's other
stuff that goes on

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:90%
that we still don't understand.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But who wants to
know everything?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd shoot myself.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Look at the mystery and
the awe and all the wonder

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:90%
in the enigma that's fun.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the spice of life.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.543 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to know everything.

00:23:04.543 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: In terms
of, again, I want

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to go back to this remote
viewing and the interaction

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
because there is certainly

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:90%
an ET presence here.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I think any thoughtful
person is aware of that.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.824 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: I agree.

00:23:18.824 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do you look
at it all as benign?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:23.571 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think there's also
a malevolent faction to it?

00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Most of the activity
is sentient machines.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You're not really dealing with
humanoid-types or carbon-based

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.992 align:middle line:90%
lifeforms.

00:23:35.992 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:90%
You're dealing with machines.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
They have been left
here to monitor us

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
or based on Mars or the
moon those kinds of things.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.555 align:middle line:90%
So you have sentient machines.

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So the
sentient machines,

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
are they piloted by things
like the Greys and others

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.045 align:middle line:90%
that people have described?

00:23:49.045 --> 00:23:50.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: No, the
Greys are connected

00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:90%
with interdimensionals.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The machines themselves,
they're on autopilot.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:90%
They know what they're doing.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.405 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Are they UFOs?

00:23:59.405 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: These are the UFOs?

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Yes.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And they
are parked usually

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.202 align:middle line:90%
inside the oceans you're saying?

00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: One of
the funny instances

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I have was the Navy Chief
of Staff for Intelligence

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
came up to Fort
Meade and asked me

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
what these-- they had
a satellite photograph

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
of two glowing white
spheres, big ones, orbs,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.752 align:middle line:84%
over a Soviet boomer, a
Soviet nuclear submarine.

00:24:23.752 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Can you take a look at these?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
What are these?

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Because they're over ours too.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
So we spent a week on that.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back,
well, what do you have?

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, you know what?

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
They're not from around here.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:90%
You mean they're Chinese?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
No, they're not
from around here.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:90%
They're real, but they're not--

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.864 align:middle line:84%
so he said, oh,
thank you very much.

00:24:46.864 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't see him again.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know what
to do the stuff.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:90%
They're throwing their hands up.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The government
itself, don't forget,

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
does not want to admit
that it doesn't know.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have a government,
it has to know everything.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Your scientists have to
be able to explain to you

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:90%
what just happened, whatever.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
A government can't
say we don't know.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: But do you think--

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.827 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned Project
Blue Book and other things

00:25:11.827 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that have been talked about
in the past, where there was

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
a supposition that the
government would utilize an ET

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
threat or the fear
of extra terrestrials

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.915 align:middle line:90%
for weaponization of space.

00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
that's part of what's

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:84%
happening with the disclosure
and why these things

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.395 align:middle line:90%
are being leaked now?

00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Department and Navy
videos of UFO craft, I mean,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:84%
are they trying to move us
to a position of being afraid

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of these beings?

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: I don't know, Sean.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they're doing,
and I haven't had time to look.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.335 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:25:40.335 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But, again, going back
to the nature of the future,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
you talked about future events.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.617 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they're benchmarks
and things like this.

00:25:47.617 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you, through
your remote viewing,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
been able to conceive of future
events for our planet or for us

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.705 align:middle line:90%
as humans?

00:25:57.705 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Only geophysical.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Geophysical events are
extremely easy to remote view

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Because your unconscious,
your superconscious,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.970 align:middle line:90%
it's your best friend.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And its highest priority
is to keep you alive.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Guardian angels have
a different priority.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But your unconscious mind,
it's the little one at night

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
when you sleep that
tries to tell you

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.777 align:middle line:84%
that you have pancreatic
cancer or this, that,

00:26:22.777 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and the other thing.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But your dreams
are all mucked up,

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up and not
getting the message.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's your best friend.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we use that
particular best friend

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to look over the
horizon, and it says

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
don't be here in this place
because of an earthquake,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
or don't be here because
of a war, or whatever,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the big events are
pretty easy to see.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It's simply because
your best friend

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:90%
is trying to keep you alive.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.059 align:middle line:84%
But are there any future
events that you could tell us

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.394 align:middle line:90%
about that you've previewed?

00:26:54.394 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: This is one I have
talked about very often.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's our own star
going on a rampage

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and producing very,
very large solar flares

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that take down power grids
in many places in the world.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to a
"Mad Max" scenarios.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.477 align:middle line:90%
Very many people suffer.

00:27:13.477 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And this as
far in the future?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Or near?

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: It doesn't look
like it's too far away.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So it would
be clear that this

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:90%
is an important skill.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.671 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is
an important skill.

00:27:22.671 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Basically it's that we are by
nature and by birth psychically

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:90%
attuned.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But essentially it's
programmed in us

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:90%
through the course of our life.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
A, how important is it to
teach and educate people

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in the remote viewing skills?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
go about doing so?

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Start with children.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this should be
taught in elementary school.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
When I teach adults,
it feels to them

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
as if they're back
in elementary school,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.161 align:middle line:90%
do this, do that grammar school.

00:27:52.161 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But it should be
taught to children.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Because children are the
future, and remote viewing

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:90%
is direct knowledge.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's a world without secrets,
and that's very, very scary

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to people that don't
want it to be exposed.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And you know who I mean.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it should
start with children.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It can make the
world more transparent.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.421 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're moving in that
direction with technology,

00:28:14.421 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
so it would make sense
that psychologically

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.619 align:middle line:84%
and psychically we should
be able to have abilities.

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: I agree, but
we're moving that way

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:90%
in terms of technology.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But you've got the
elite out there,

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I think they're called
these days the deep state,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.216 align:middle line:90%
that needs to control that.

00:28:28.216 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
control the world,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
you better control information,
education, food, energy,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying
their best to do it.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But you can't stop someone
from remote viewing.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:90%
You cannot.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Speaking
of food, does diet

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.871 align:middle line:84%
play a role into achieving
optimal psychic abilities?

00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: Absolutely not.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:90%
It's irrelevant.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Diet has no bearing whatsoever.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a couple of impediments.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I had an
office in Beverly Hills,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and I trained a lot
of Hollywood-types.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of pot smokers.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Heavy duty pot smoking,
what happens in the higher

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.500 align:middle line:84%
stages of remote viewing, you go
in the stream of consciousness,

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and so it's a real
impediment to learning.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.054 align:middle line:90%
Other than that.

00:29:15.054 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You're
saying pot actually

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:84%
makes an impediment to your
ability to remote view?

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:26.659 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: Yeah, higher level
skills, yes, strong use of pot.

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And is there
anything in particular

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that you feel your
work is going forth?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
important mission

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.390 align:middle line:90%
you're on at this point?

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DAMES: The most
important mission

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that I have as my
legacy is to leave

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
behind the knowledge
of how to remove view

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and how important it is.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I have some personal things,
but that's very important.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And also, since AI is going to
supplant so many different jobs

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
in so many different
venues on Earth--

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:90%
let's face it.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen--

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.964 align:middle line:84%
robots will need an
excuse to keep us around.

00:30:04.964 --> 00:30:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They'll be able to
teach remote viewing.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:84%
If they watch me
teach remote viewing,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
they'll be able to teach,
perhaps better than I,

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:84%
based upon the feedback
from the student.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.410 align:middle line:10%
But they won't be
able to remove view

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:10%
because they don't have a mind.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:10%
They have a processor
that's very, very fast.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
a mind, and mind

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.905 align:middle line:90%
is required for remote viewing.

00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Consciousness
is the key,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're becoming more
of a global consciousness.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.165 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing time.

00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DAMES: The pleasure is mine.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure to meet you.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely, thank you.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:10%
And that is all the time we
have for this week's "Buzzsaw."
