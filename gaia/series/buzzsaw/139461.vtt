Consciousness, ayahuasca,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.831 align:middle line:90%
and the future of humanity.

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:18.529 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:10%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and joining me today

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:10%
is Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder
of the think tank

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Center for Planetary Culture,
which produced the Regenerative

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Society Wiki.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.431 align:middle line:84%
And his essays and
articles have been

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
featured in "The New York
Times" magazine, "Esquire,"

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
"Rolling Stone," "ArtForum,"
"The New York Times Book

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Review," "The Village Voice,"
and "Dazed and Confused."

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
He's the star of the
2010 documentary, "2012,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
a Time for Change."

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
His books include "Breaking
Open the Head," and "2012,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
the Return of Quetzalcoatl,"
and his most recent book,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:90%
"How Soon is Now?"

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Today he joins us for a
deeper view into his research

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and to this post-2012
world, which is really

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:84%
where I would like to start
the conversation, is obviously,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
you wrote this
book about 2012 as,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.145 align:middle line:84%
frankly, what does that
year mean to mankind?

00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL PINCHBECK:
Well, I mean,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I never really thought
it was the year itself.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.221 align:middle line:84%
I know the title
maybe suggests that.

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:10%
But essentially,
the book was looking

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:10%
at indigenous spiritual
knowledge systems.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
modern West kind of

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
rejected the knowledge
of these other cultures

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.092 align:middle line:84%
as primitive or just
folk tale or whatever.

00:01:29.092 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote my first book,
"Breaking Open the Head,"

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
which was on
psychedelic shamanism,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I had many experiences visiting
tribes in the Amazon and Africa

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and Mexico that profoundly
shifted my way of understanding

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that these
psychic realms that the shamans

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
talk about, these occult
and esoteric realities,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:90%
have a truth to them.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I then realized
that I had to take

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge systems of
indigenous people a lot

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.281 align:middle line:90%
more seriously.

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that led me
to look at things

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
like the ideas of the classical
Mayan civilization, which

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
point towards this period
being the end of a 5,125

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
year long count cycle.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.739 align:middle line:84%
Or the Hopi Indians
in Arizona are

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the original
dwellers on this continent, who

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.776 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a relationship
to the classical Mayan

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
civilization, who
talk about this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
as the transition
between the fourth world

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.342 align:middle line:90%
and the fifth world.

00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, in
that book, I was

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
looking at it on many
different levels,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out what these
cultures were talking about

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and also trying to
put it in a language

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of our modern Western
understanding.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at philosophers
like Nietzsche and Heidegger

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and visionaries like Rudolf
Steiner and Carl Jung,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and this guy Jean Gebser
was really important.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was a 450 page
book, and it's a lot

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:90%
to sum up in a few minutes.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not as much
summarizing the book.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply curious as far
as I think there's almost--

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is there
almost was a consciousness

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
shift in our Western
culture, because 2012 became

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
a monumental year in the
sense that people felt,

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
well, it might be
the end of the world.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But that was a misunderstanding
of the Mayan culture.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But for the first
time, perhaps the West

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
re-embraced or
reconnected to some

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of these indigenous
traditions, right?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So this notion of 2012 being
a symbolic and monumental year

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
in my culture, the fact that the
West recognized that, I think

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.379 align:middle line:84%
that already indicates a
shift in the consciousness

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
of the Western world,
almost as though some

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of these indigenous
mythologies and cultures

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
are now being re-embraced
and reincorporated

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:90%
into our Western society.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't that what 2012
might ultimately be about?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, OK.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I suppose.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I made a film also.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.151 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, in a way,
I left that time feeling

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a
disappointment, because I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
felt it was kind of like an
invitation from the universe

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
for the modern civilization
to look at its practices

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:90%
and rethink.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these
traditional societies

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
around the world and
tribal cultures model a lot

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
of sustainable ecological
practices ways for groups

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:90%
to work together cohesively.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I felt there was a
bigger opportunity for us

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
we've gone off track,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and that actually,
we had to go back

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to some of these
indigenous cultures

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:90%
and learn more from them.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a kind of
prophetic, multidimensional

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
our circumstance.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I suppose this is what
we're meant to be doing.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're
meant to be at.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So I am a bit
concerned, and that's

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the jumping off point
for the new book

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is really that we're
really running out

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
of time to deal with the
ecological mega-crisis

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
before it threatens our
continuity, and particularly

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
the continuity of our children
and grandchildren and so on.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But isn't that
the point of being

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
in the post-2012
world, is the fact

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that we are entering
the fifth world,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
as, for example, the
Mayans talked about

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient
civilizations talked about.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.073 align:middle line:90%
It's quite possible.

00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: What does that mean?

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
What is their
prediction of where

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
we go in this time period?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
the transitory time,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
it didn't happen
instantaneously,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
it didn't happen
overnight that we embraced

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%
a more holistic approach.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:90%
But perhaps this is the crisis--

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
isn't this the crisis
necessary for us

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.046 align:middle line:90%
to evolve in our consciousness?

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:11.846 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like, for
instance, Sergio Magana

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is a Toltec shaman writer who is
trying to integrate the Toltec

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:90%
and Aztec traditions.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And he writes about how the
period from 2012 to 2021

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is kind of our transition
into-- they talk about it

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
as being from an age of
light to an age of darkness,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
where in the time of
darkness, it's like the dream

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
reality becomes more prevalent.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And I do feel--

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very subtle and
complex thing to talk about,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
but there are ways
where our reality seems

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to be becoming more psychically
permeable, more dreamlike, more

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:90%
overtly dreamlike.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Whether you put that in the
language of technology and talk

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
about it feeling like virtual
reality or a computer game

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
simulation, or in the
language of Eastern philosophy

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and talk about it as a Maya
or a Lila or a divine play

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So I do feel that
we are-- there are

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.112 align:middle line:84%
a lot of reasons to think that
we're in this transition time.

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: In terms of the
overall nature of dreamtime,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and frankly, we are living
with more information, more--

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say this.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge, to a
certain extent, yeah.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I think we have more knowledge,
more access to knowledge,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
more access to
information, at least,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
than ever before
in human history.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.109 align:middle line:84%
And so it does
inevitably, I think,

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
has to create a
certain schizophrenia

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
within the human
psyche as far as what

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do with all
this information awareness.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
We're engaging interactively
with people across the planet

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that a hundred years
ago, we would never

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
know their plight
or their situation.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a sudden,
it's in our consciousness

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.956 align:middle line:84%
So of course I think
human consciousness

00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
has to figure out how to adapt
to this new reality of so

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
much information overload,
you could almost call it, no?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big problem is we
have more and more information

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and data and yada, yada.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like wisdom is
still in very short supply.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.992 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there was
this one thinker I reference

00:07:00.992 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
in the new book,
Peter Russell, who

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
talked about how there is
this potential that we might

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
be exiting the
Age of Information

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and entering an age that he
talks about as the Wisdom Age.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what I tried
to suss out in my new book.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Like if we were to take a step
back from all the ideologies

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs and what
a nation state is,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and the military industrial
complex, and a Pentagon,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and a religion, and
so on, and go back

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to our phenomenological baseline
reality, which psychedelics are

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
actually extremely helpful to
deprogram you and decondition

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
you from a lot of junk and
to see that actually, we're

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
basically a species living
on Earth with a bunch

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of other species, and we have
to figure out how we conduct

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in a way that's
harmonious for the ecology

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.744 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth as a whole system.

00:07:50.744 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, we're
doing totally the opposite.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.801 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, your new book,
"How Soon Is Now" totally

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
focuses on this ecological
crisis that we're facing.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have seen
cataclysmic shifts

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.976 align:middle line:84%
throughout human history,
and they have basically--

00:08:04.976 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, weather, Earth,
forces adaptation, right?

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It forces us to
evolve and to adapt.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So don't you think maybe this
is just almost a teleological,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
in a teleological sense, like
this is forcing our adaptation,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we are
ready for it or not,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
whether we like it or not,
to move into a different way

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.250 align:middle line:84%
That's totally part of the
thesis of the new book.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I think I would say that somehow
the ecological crisis is maybe

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
something, in a way,
that we've subconsciously

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.237 align:middle line:84%
willed into existence to
force our transcendence

00:08:36.237 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
or to force ourselves to
go through an initiation.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that in the book
from a lot of different angles.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all,
modern Western civilization

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is the only culture
that did away with rites

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:90%
of passage and initiation.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So Aboriginals or
Amazonian tribespeople

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:84%
all over the world, you have to
go through some type of ordeal

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to be recognized as an adult.
And those ordeals often

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
involve going through a
transpersonal visionary

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:90%
experience through privation.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It could be through fasting
or through ayahuasca or peyote

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:90%
or a walkabout or sundance.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.779 align:middle line:84%
And for those
cultures, they really

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:14.319 align:middle line:84%
felt that that was the only way
you could be an adult, if you

00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:90%
had that type of experience.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And our culture
doesn't have those.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And it may be, as I
look at in the book,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that it might actually be almost
like a neurophysiological need

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.321 align:middle line:90%
to have that type of initiation.

00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't, you're trapped

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:90%
in a kind of adolescent state.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
look around now,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that people running
our countries

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
are more and more
kind of like kidults.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
They're very immature and
adolescent in their needs

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and their greeds and
their desires and so on.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not going to
be very successful for us, even

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:90%
on a short-term basis.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's the possibility
that we've subconsciously

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
willed this ecological crisis
to bring about a transformation.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that we don't
do very-- like, unless there's

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.797 align:middle line:84%
a crisis, people don't
really change, right?

00:10:02.797 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
As long as you can just
get by and go to Starbucks

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and have your
pumpkin latte, you're

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
not going to put yourself
through some kind of ordeal

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.972 align:middle line:84%
to gain a deeper level
of consciousness.

00:10:11.972 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And you've
said, obviously,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that you believe
that drugs can play--

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.873 align:middle line:84%
especially hallucinogenics--
can play an important role.

00:10:17.873 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we've seen the dark
side of drug abuse, right?

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to hallucinogenics,

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.355 align:middle line:84%
it tends to be a bit
less abused, I would say,

00:10:25.355 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
than the more
recreational drugs.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
What role do you think
hallucinogenics play?

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.544 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that everyone
should take ayahuasca

00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
at some point in their life?

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: That's when
I guess it shows how far

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
down the path I've gone,
that I sort of flinch away

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
both from the word drugs
and the word hallucinogenics

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
in association with something
like ayahuasca or peyote

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
or mushrooms, which
believe in these cultures

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
were seen as sacred and
visionary medicines.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Medicines for the
soul and the spirit.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is exciting--
because my first book,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
which was on psychedelic
shamanism, came out in 2002.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's been exciting
to see a deep shift

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
in the cultural awareness
around the potential value

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:90%
of these substances.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you have a
lot of studies going on.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.592 align:middle line:84%
Johns Hopkins has done
studies giving psilocybin

00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to people who had never had
a psychedelic experience,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and discovering that
it was one of the most

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.782 align:middle line:84%
powerful and beneficial
experiences of their lives.

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
There are studies
on psilocybin for

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:84%
obsessive compulsive disorder,
LSD for depression, and so on.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So I think that yeah.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
That these substances hold
out tremendous hope for us.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.357 align:middle line:90%
Particularly we can see that--

00:11:37.357 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
from my perspective, which
may be different than yours--

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
people have gotten locked
into these very limited, kind

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.459 align:middle line:84%
of rigid belief
systems and ideologies.

00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
psychedelic experience

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
is one of the only ways that
people can be shifted quickly

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
from being locked into
egoic structures, which

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:84%
then lead them to believe
the world can only

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.671 align:middle line:90%
be a certain way.

00:11:58.671 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Because that is--
strikes me as one

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
of the problems with
a lot of the drugs,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and particularly things
like cocaine, for example,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
is how much it
does seem to fuel,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
actually, egoic process
and actually reinforce

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
the power of the ego.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
had such a hold over--

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.277 align:middle line:84%
enslaving, frankly,
massive amounts

00:12:14.277 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of people throughout time.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Not just cocaine, but other
drugs in that same modality,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:90%
That sort of structure.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's reinforce the ego and
tell you everything's fine,

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an anti-depressant
or any kind of sedative,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to keep you calm and function
rather than actually breaking

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.715 align:middle line:84%
through your normal
level of consciousness

00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and frame of reality.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.881 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I do want to
say about-- the cocaine comes

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
from the coca leaf.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually
done some retreats

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
with tribal people in
Colombia, in the mountains

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:90%
from the Kogi and the Arawak.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And they use coca leaf,
and for them, it's

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
a very sacred medicine.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And I experienced it with them.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I was actually shocked at how
subtle and profound it was

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and how it was like a heart
opener and a mind opener.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:90%
So we tend to misuse substances.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We isolate the catalysts,
we bind them with an acid,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:90%
we look for the fastest rush.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And also for us to be still
de-legitimizing and demonizing

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic substances
seems absurd

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
when people are on all
sorts of antidepressants,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
mood controllers,
mood stabilizers,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
anti-anxiety medications.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think that these
medications are all mostly

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.522 align:middle line:90%
pretty dangerous.

00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes people
will have a major emergency,

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and they should be able to
get on a short time thing,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
but because they program
people so they're

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
able to function
in a sick society,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
rather than helping them have a
liberating insight so they can

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.609 align:middle line:84%
maybe change themselves, and
then by doing that also change

00:13:44.609 --> 00:13:45.408 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.206 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: I mean,
very interesting research

00:13:48.206 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is being done now with MDMA and
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They're giving it to veterans
from the Iraq and Afghanistan

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.974 align:middle line:84%
wars who have treatment
adverse forms of PTSD.

00:13:56.974 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So they've tried all
these different therapies

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and medicines, and
nothing's worked.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding at
having a more than 60%

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
success rate in phase
2 clinical trials.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.897 align:middle line:84%
So that's also very,
very interesting.

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I think that
would, obviously,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
be one of the main reasons why
the government and the powers

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that be would actually want to
block things like MDMA or also

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.307 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca in particular
from being used.

00:14:18.307 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
As it not only would put us
into a higher state of bliss

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and awareness, but
without ayahuasca,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
we start to see through
a lot of the structures.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.598 align:middle line:84%
We start to become, as you say,
changing our consciousness,

00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
aware of perhaps
extradimensional entities,

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
alien beings, a
different alternative

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.132 align:middle line:84%
history of our planet
than what we were taught.

00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So many insights, I think,
that come, and wisdom that

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.548 align:middle line:90%
comes with the hallucinogens.

00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:42.304 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think
that's a powerful tool

00:14:42.304 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
within the hallucinogens, is the
insights and the knowledge that

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:90%
comes with them?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah, definitely.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think what happened
in the '60s, it was very abrupt,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
This huge upsurge of
liberational energy

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that maybe was linked to
the Pluto Uranus transit

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
of the mid-60s or whatever.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And it created a lot
of fear in the form

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:90%
of a conservative establishment.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So in '66, the year I was
born, and the next years after,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
all these substances
were demonized.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
They were made schedule
1, totally illegal.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't even
have human beings

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
allowed to take them in research
studies until the late '90s.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But now it feels like our
culture has reached a maturity

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:84%
where we're actually being able
to assimilate these things back

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:90%
into our world in a healthy way.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.585 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
with ayahuasca,

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
there have been
significant legal cases

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
supporting allowing
for religious use

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:90%
of these substances and so on.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully we won't
see a rollback of that,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.592 align:middle line:84%
as I think it's a
positive option for us.

00:15:39.592 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So as we
were talking about

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:84%
before, if this phase, from
post-2012 to maybe 2021

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
or in this range time period
is an age of transition,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
let's say, what does
the next phase look

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:90%
like according to the ancients?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.299 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, I don't know.

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, it's hard to say,
because they speak a language

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:90%
of myth and parable, I guess.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I've tried to present
an option in the book

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:84%
that if we were to see this
as a great opportunity for us

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.911 align:middle line:84%
to undergo a kind of initiation
individually and collectively,

00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and we were to sort of stop
in our tracks a little bit

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't actually
keep doing this.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:22.414 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep doing everybody
getting a new car and everybody

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
flying all around the world,
and everybody consuming

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
so much meat,
because our planet is

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
going to be done in a
relatively short period of time.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.826 align:middle line:84%
So we would then need to think
about what do we do after that.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
suggest in the book

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is we could look at
transitions in terms

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
of the technical infrastructure,
energy, industry,

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
agriculture shifts in terms of
our political, economic social

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
systems, and then also
how that transition would

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
have to be developed in terms
of our consciousness, values,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
beliefs, and ideologies.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, those three
areas are the big ones.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And the way the technical area
is the simplest to understand.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.546 align:middle line:84%
Like energy, we could organize--
like in the Second World

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
War, when Pearl Harbor
happened, the US

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
changed its entire industrial
system in three months.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Taxed rich people at 94%.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And went into a war mode,
was able to defeat the highly

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
advanced Nazi situation.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So we could go through
a global mobilization

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.038 align:middle line:84%
around shifting to
renewable energy.

00:17:21.038 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
And instead of doing it
in 100 years or 50 years,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:90%
we could do it in 10, 12 years.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
We could use all
the technologies

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
we have in education,
in agriculture.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We can make a rapid shift
from industrial monoculture

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
agriculture to regenerative
farming practices that

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
include things like no-till
farming and permaculture

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%
where appropriate.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And we would have
to agree, sort of

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
like a global moratorium on
meat eating as much as possible.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Because meat factory
farming and animal grazing

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for about
30% of our CO2 emissions.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So that would be how we've been
looking at the agriculture.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And then in the political
economic system,

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I think that's tougher.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective-- maybe
you and I differ on this--

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I see this recent
election showing

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of extreme
hyper-consumerist greed-based

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
capitalism and maybe
even this nation

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
state system have reached
their final stage, their death

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:90%
throes, in a sense.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And it might be possible to use
social tools and the internet

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to create something more
like a global participatory

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
democracy that was
decentralized that

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
would scale up from
local communities

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:90%
to bioregions to planetary.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And people would
not just be voting

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
for some idiotic candidate every
few years but be constantly

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:84%
involved in a process
of political engagement

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
where they would be
having a range of areas

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.489 align:middle line:84%
that they could be
involved with or vote on.

00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have an
expertise in an area,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:90%
they could proxy their vote.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The internet, properly,
I think, should

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
be a learning and
decision-making

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
machine for humanity, not
a value extraction machine.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And economics, money, I
think, is the main problem.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Our money system is debt
based, so it actually

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
fuels constant
unsustainable growth.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, we know that
global GDP is growing, I think,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
2% or 3% a year, while global
debt is growing at 7% a year.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's forced to
keep developing, building

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
more buildings and
skyscrapers and resorts,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and so on, but that's tipping
over the whole balance

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
of the ecology.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So we need to go into something
more like a degrowth model,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:84%
where we slow down
unsustainable forms of growth,

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
focus on elevating
the lives of the poor

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and the disenfranchised,
recognizing that we are one

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
human family and have
a shared responsibility

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.732 align:middle line:84%
for our entire human
family, and then

00:19:45.732 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
developing a system
that allows for that.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.814 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very much
along the lines

00:19:48.814 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of what Buckminster Fuller
put out in the 1960s in books

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
like "Utopia and Oblivion" or
"Operation Spaceship Earth,"

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.894 align:middle line:84%
where he realized that we
had the technical capacity

00:19:57.894 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to make a world that
works for everyone,

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
but our ideologies and our
political-economic systems

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
were these horrible obstructions
that were stopping them.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But it seems that part
of the way of solving some

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of these issues that
you're pointing out

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
will be the use of
the virtual reality.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.715 align:middle line:84%
The fact that people can now
access and enjoy much more

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and achieve more
of their desires

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and wants through
gaming or virtual worlds

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and virtual experiences
and exploration

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that will potentially
help satiate

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:84%
physical needs, material
desires, to a certain degree.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: did I say that?

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Huh?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm simply--
I'm saying that it

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:84%
seems that might be something
that would help to calm down

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.067 align:middle line:84%
some of the overall
desires for physical growth

00:20:39.067 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: It's possible.

00:20:41.275 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think the
question of technology

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:90%
is a very intricate one.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea
of the singularity

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:84%
is a model that's
very, very pleasant

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:84%
for the corporate
globalization powers,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
because it pushes us towards
more and more consumption

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.236 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the problem with
all of our tech toys

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is that they do exert a
negative impact on the ecology.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I think it's
like 3 million people have died

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of genocides in
Africa to provide

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.161 align:middle line:84%
the raw materials for our cell
phones and laptops and so on.

00:21:16.161 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I am concerned that
virtual reality, on the one

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:84%
hand, wires us into another
kind of delusionary framework,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and on the other continues
this extraction of resources

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And that actually, there
might be an alternative

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
would be more like
using technology

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.542 align:middle line:84%
in actual engagement
with other people.

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a way, something
like what the Burning Man

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Festival reveals, where
people come together

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy their creative
capacities in a form of play,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's not about retreating
into a solipsistic virtual

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It's more about creating
communities of practice

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:90%
and play and pleasure together.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.024 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: But in terms of--

00:21:59.024 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I guess part of
the reason why I'm

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
thinking of the virtual realm is
that it does seem to have been

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.462 align:middle line:84%
a spin off of a lot
of the hallucinogenics

00:22:05.462 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that were done in the '60s
and '70s because of people

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
like Jobs and others who
were part of that scene

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and utilizing a lot of
these hallucinogenics

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
were inspired into that notion
of windows into another world.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.724 align:middle line:84%
Basically using-- the mind's
eye became the computer screen,

00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of internet and
of these places that we could

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.919 align:middle line:84%
go to that would be other
dimensions of reality

00:22:26.919 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
were very much a
reflection, I think,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of their own experiences with
the hallucinogenic drugs.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see a certain
compatibility between, I think,

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
your own quest
for inner journeys

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and journeys within the
realms of consciousness

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility
of the vistas

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
that are allowed by not just
virtual, but just all aspects

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of internet and
computer-based technologies

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to take us to new places in
the realm of consciousness.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.976 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Yeah,
it is possible.

00:22:53.976 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that
technologies also have

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:90%
a Janus face, the shadow side.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And I think what we've seen--

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once again,
you and I maybe

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
differ on the value of
the recent election.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I was neither supportive
of either candidate.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:10%
But now we have a
very fractured world,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:10%
where people are totally
enmeshed in these kind

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.819 align:middle line:10%
of delusionary feedback
loops, where they're only

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:10%
getting information from the
certain sources they agree

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:10%
with.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.122 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our technologies
have seemed very positive,

00:23:26.122 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and they have produced
positive benefits,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but they've also had a lot
of negative aspects to them.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm afraid, if we
look at, once again,

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
going back to the ecological
thing, it's really dire.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
We're losing 150 to 200 species
a day, according to scientists.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Of our-- it's like 8.7 million
species totally on the planet.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're losing something like
10% of the Earth's biodiversity

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:90%
every 10 to 15 years.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the
Earth's biodiversity

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
is a very intricate web.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:84%
We're burning down a lot
of the world's forests.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
The tropical forests produce
20% of the oxygen we breathe.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We now know that we're on
the track for, I don't know,

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
three four degrees
Celsius temperature rise,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't even take
into account the methane which

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is frozen under the-- you
know about this, right?

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.539 align:middle line:84%
Which is what caused the Permian
Mass Extinction and so on.

00:24:13.539 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And if that methane
starts to release

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.462 align:middle line:84%
and the warming
goes faster, that

00:24:17.462 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
affects the plankton
in the oceans,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
which produce like 60%
of the oxygen we breathe.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So if we continue
on the present path,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going to asphyxiate
ourselves or just create

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
a biological desert,
where it will

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.056 align:middle line:84%
be very difficult for
us to survive, certainly

00:24:32.056 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in large numbers.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm concerned about
people getting more wired

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:90%
into these virtual dimensions.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I do think they could be
teaching tools and training

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.659 align:middle line:84%
tools and maybe
tools for empathy.

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But I also think there
could be a lot of dangers,

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.074 align:middle line:84%
not just being continuing this
present journey that we're

00:24:46.074 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
having towards
alienation and solipsism

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:90%
in technological bubbles.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, as we
were talking about before,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.377 align:middle line:84%
the fact is that we're now
more connected than ever.

00:24:56.377 --> 00:24:58.085 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness-wise,
we're able to connect

00:24:58.085 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:90%
with people in Afghanistan.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in places that even
15 years ago, we simply

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.029 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go to war
with, whether it's

00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Iran or Afghanistan or
Iraq, and now you're

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:84%
on Facebook and
Twitter, and you have

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
people from those
cultures following you,

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're
interacting with them.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.835 align:middle line:84%
So don't you think this is
actually leveling the playing

00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
field of human consciousnesses?

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
This is making us
truly global humans.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
The technology is enabling
us to actually basically find

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:90%
this global mind more and more.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PINCHBECK: Yes.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is one of
our great potential hopes,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
if it was to move in the
right direction quickly.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like it's been
a little bit taken over

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
by other forces and
directions right now.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: So ultimately, because--

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.688 align:middle line:84%
I keep coming back to
this consciousness thing,

00:25:47.688 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like
consciousness is so--

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well, for instance,
I have friends who are building

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
global meditation apps, which
you guys probably know about

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam, where everybody--

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:84%
thousands of people
could meditate together

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
or potentially maybe do psychic
exercises together eventually.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:90%
That interests me a lot.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.499 align:middle line:84%
So I do feel that
the technologies

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
could be an enabler
for the emergence

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:90%
of a true global brain.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
An empathic and
connected whole is

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:84%
seeking to emerge
through this technology.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I do think that's true.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, so
much of your work

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is focused on this issue
of human consciousness

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and how it's an individual
journey into our consciousness,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
deepening our consciousness
and hopefully expanding it

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and you know raising it, right?

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And trying to connect with
each other across the planet.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You ultimately see it as though
we are going into a new--

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is it a new phase that we're
going to enter, ultimately,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.549 align:middle line:84%
or do you think
that it's ultimately

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:43.675 align:middle line:90%
returned to past practices?

00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:45.382 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
talking about going back

00:26:45.382 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to more holistic
approaches, but that

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.620 align:middle line:84%
was with a different--
well, there

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:84%
was a different level of
population on the planet.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a different level of
being that was more fractured,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.622 align:middle line:84%
frankly, at that time, when
the cultures, the Mayans

00:26:56.622 --> 00:26:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and the various-- the
Aztecs, the Mayans,

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
all these different cultures
were separated from Europe,

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:90%
from Asia.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Actually,
that's not necessarily

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:90%
the case, actually.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's the
"Voyages of the Pyramid

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.562 align:middle line:84%
Builders," by Robert
Schoch, I think it is,

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%
who actually finds that
there were definitely--

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.790 align:middle line:84%
like it was more like one
unified, global, mystical

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
culture, where they found
remnants of tobacco and cocaine

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.027 align:middle line:84%
in the pharaohs in the pyramids,
which basically reveals

00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that there were these trade
routes between South America

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and Egypt and so on.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So ultimately
a returning to a past

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
when there was perhaps a
globalized civilization that

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.527 align:middle line:90%
has been buried.

00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:90%
The age of the pyramid builders.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:90%
We're returning to that time.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's-- I wouldn't
say it's a return.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's a
spiraling upward.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And a spiral connects.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The same thing comes
up on another level

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
of the evolutionary spiral.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get
our act together,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
one of the theories
in the book is

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that we are on the verge
of this realization

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're a super
organism that is

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:84%
in a symbiotic relationship
with the Earth's

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.420 align:middle line:90%
ecology of the whole system.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we fully integrate
that understanding,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
we'll see that we have to
change our systems in that way.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I look at how in the
history of evolution, actually,

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
competition is always
outcompeted by cooperation.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the survival of the
fittest or this idea that it's

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:84%
a competition or
domination-based system

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is very shallow compared
to the much deeper level

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation and symbiosis.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.022 align:middle line:84%
Our own bodies are this
incredible example of symbiosis

00:28:31.022 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and cooperation, right?

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Like 10 trillion cells
and microorganisms

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:90%
that mesh together.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And these
microorganisms were once

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.605 align:middle line:84%
competing in an environment
for scarce resources

00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and trying to even consume each
other, in certain respects,

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
according to like Lynn
Margulis and so on.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then they learned
to work together

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to construct these more complex
structures, like skin and eyes

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So we could look at now, like
we have corporations, which

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
are these artificial
lifeforms that in a way,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
they're like the organs of the
collective body of humanity.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.957 align:middle line:84%
Like an energy company is
like the blood circulating

00:29:03.957 --> 00:29:05.665 align:middle line:84%
through the body, or
a sanitation company

00:29:05.665 --> 00:29:07.977 align:middle line:84%
is like the liver or
kidney or something.

00:29:07.977 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Media companies are like
the perceptual mechanisms

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that's taking in raw
data and turning it

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:84%
into memes that the rest
of the body then acts on,

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.040 align:middle line:90%
rightly or wrongly.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:10%
So I think that that could
be the emergence of us

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:10%
in this more holistic sense as a
planetary community recognizing

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:10%
that we're one global
tribe, one human family,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:10%
recognizing also that we
have psychic abilities, which

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:10%
is what a lot of these ancient
cultures were fascinated with.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.495 align:middle line:84%
So I see a potential
future trajectory,

00:29:38.495 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
which is what I talk
about in the book.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
We both go down and in.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:10%
We go deeper into these
infinite psychic dimensions

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:10%
that experiences like
ayahuasca and DMT reveal,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:10%
and we go up and out.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:90%
We get off the earth.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We create colonies
in other worlds.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We terraform other
worlds into biospheres,

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
hopefully we encounter
other extraterrestrials.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's an either/or,

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.779 align:middle line:84%
but I think those are the two
great paths that-- those would

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
be the two great
frontiers for our future

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:84%
if we could stop trying
to kill each other

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and take away people's civil
rights and putting down women

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.338 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that seems
to be really popular right now.

00:30:14.338 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, so ultimately,
what is the power

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of the individual in such a
totalitarian system as you

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
describe, with these massive
corporations and power

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.220 align:middle line:90%
companies and whatnot?

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: What is the
power of the individual now?

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:90%
The individual.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:27.635 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:27.635 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Well,
we don't know.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
The individual has
infinite potential.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one individual
can change the world

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
by the power of their
actions or their thoughts

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
or just by getting it together.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.784 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Thank you
so much, Daniel.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.750 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your time.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.996 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great interview.

00:30:42.996 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for coming on.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.612 align:middle line:84%
>>PINCHBECK: Thanks
for listening.

00:30:45.612 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Some great insights
from Daniel Pinchbeck.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
today, but I do urge you
to check out his new book,

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:90%
"How Soon Is Now?"

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:84%
along the buzzsaw's edge, and it
requires constant reassessment.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.
