>> SEAN STONE: Imagine the
space around us is not empty,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.580 align:middle line:90%
but charged with electricity.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.400 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:22.026 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
narratives to explore the
twilight zones of reality.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
With me today is
David Talbott, who

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:10%
is an author and mythologist,
as well as the founding

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
member of the
Thunderbolts Project,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:10%
a collaborative gathering
of scholars and scientists

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:10%
seeking to better understand
the role of electrical events

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:10%
in space, in biological
systems, and in the human past.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
His amazing insights into
the electric universe

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and how it plugs
into ancient myths

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are some of the topics
we'll be discussing.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So Dave, I want to
start by asking you

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
about Immanuel Velikovsky,
who is known for his book,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
"Worlds in Collision," which
was a bestseller in 1950.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And how did his work inspire
some of the electrical universe

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:90%
conceptions?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:10%
>> DAVID TALBOTT: Well, I'd
start with the effect that

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:10%
Velikovsky's work hard on
me because it was profound.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It was life altering.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've never looked
back since then.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I started an investigation
of ancient myths,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
specifically because
I wanted to know

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
if Immanuel Velikovsky
could possibly

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
be right in his
extraordinary claim

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that the planet Venus
was once a comet.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you begin following
that, it doesn't stop.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I've
never let the subject go.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But the subject broadened into
a more multi-disciplinary study

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because other people come
in from other fields.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We're getting interested
in the same topic.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, Velikovsky had
an extraordinary statement

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
in an unpublished manuscript.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It was originally
an opening section

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
of "Worlds in Collision,"
his bestselling book.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But he pulled it
out because he felt

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
it needed more examination and
more development as a story.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So that left me then
with an opportunity

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to look at Velikovksy's
opening segment of "Worlds

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in Collision," which is
actually quite interesting,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Immanuel Velikovsky concluded
from his own investigation

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of human origins and
the origins of myth.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
He concluded that the
planet Saturn was once

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:90%
a spectacular body in our sky.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was possible because we
were in a dynamic relationship

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to Saturn.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Earth and Saturn
were in a close--

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
they were in close
proximity, let's say,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and moving through an
electrified environment.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Today, we refer to that
environment as the plasma

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:90%
medium of the solar system.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And so uncharged particles
fill the empty space.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's because
the solar system.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And Velikovsky recognized
that electricity

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
across the solar system
had a powerful effect

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%
on ancient events.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Electric currents,
electric discharge

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
produced events between
planets in ancient times

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that were the provocation
for the great myths

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, how could we possibly
believe that today?

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we insist that
the ancient sky looked

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
much like our sky today,
it's entirely implausible.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The millions and
billions of miles

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that separate planets
today would not

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
allow for that kind of
dynamic electric activity

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:90%
in ancient times.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But what about the possibility
that a congregation

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
of planets in an earlier
phase of the solar system

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:90%
was very close.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They were interacting
with each other.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, is that worth asking?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only way you can know
whether the question is worth

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:90%
asking is to ask it and see.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's what I did in 1972.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I asked the question.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I am still working with
the answers to that question.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But it broadened out
because you can't

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
talk about Mars and
the ancient world

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
without running right
into the comet Venus.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So a dance of Mars
and Venus is implied

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
in all of the
ancient cultures that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
talk about those two bodies.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: That's why,
in the Greek mythology,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.674 align:middle line:90%
Mars was married to Venus.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: It's the--

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and not just in Greek mythology.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
That is a virtually
global theme.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's preposterous.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
You cannot ever explain that
global theme by something that

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:90%
we observe today.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we are required
by the things we now know

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:90%
to ask a different question.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
What was the ancient sky
presenting to human observers

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that made Mars
masculine and Venus feminine?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what was that
relationship like between Mars

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and Venus?

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Well, the
solar system was completely

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We have to start with that,
just as a possibility,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:90%
and then begin exploring.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Why did the early cultures
the world over envision

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:84%
a marriage of a feminine
Venus and a masculine Mars?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is an
almost endless story.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And it carried through
all of ancient history

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:90%
into medieval times.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
You're still seeing the
marriage of Mars and Venus.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And it gets more
complex than that.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But that underpinning of Mars
is masculine, Venus is feminine,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
has no explanation
under common assumptions

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:90%
today, just no explanation.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But what about the possibility
that we've completely

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:84%
misunderstood the history
of the solar system?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you pose
that question,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
you will never stop
running into evidence

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that the solar system was
once utterly different

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:90%
than what it is now.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
We were part of a close
congregation of planets

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%
towering over humanity.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Just towering over
humans on Earth

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
who experienced this
explosion of imagination

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
because these were terrifying
and awe-inspiring events.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were the provocation
of all of world mythology.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if when I make a
statement of that sort,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
it immediately creates a demand
that I substantiate that.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something to
be substantiated overnight.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But it is something that
has been substantiated

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
within the electric
universe movement,

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
and specifically our
Thunderbolts Project.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
That world mythology originated
in spectacular planetary dramas

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, close
to the Earth, where

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Venus were
primary players, but not

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
the only players.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to actually ask
other questions as well as to--

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Like why in mythology,
why does Jupiter become

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
the Zeus figure, the primary
god, overthrows Saturn?

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you just said,
and overthrow Saturn.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:90%
So that introduces two players.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fastest way
to get to the answer

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Jupiter-Saturn
relationship, which

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is quite different from the
Venus-Mars relationship,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:90%
but not really separate from it.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the planets
were all part

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
of a close
congregation of bodies.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, at some point
in an investigation

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of the origins of ancient myth
in planetary behavior, things

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that actually were seen in the
engagement of planets close

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth, you come up
to the great conjunction

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:90%
of primeval times.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, what in the name
of heaven was that?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The great conjunction
of primeval times.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Look it up and you'll
see that people

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
have acknowledged that
there is this tradition

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:90%
of a great conjunction.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: The golden age.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.538 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Now,
how is it defined?

00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The golden age involved
a great conjunction.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
When planets do it in
perfect conjunction, not

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:90%
a loose conjunction.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
We refer to a great conjunction
today when Jupiter and--

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
just Jupiter and Mars
are within 20 degrees

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of each other in the
sky because that's

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the best that the
sky today gives us.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
planetary arrangement.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And it involves something
called collinear alignment.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
That's planets in line
at equilibrium positions

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that keep them in line as
they're moving around the sun.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And that produced
a configuration

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, which I gave the
name the polar configuration.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:90%
Because it was axial.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It was along the north
polar axis of the Earth.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Saturn
standing visually

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
at the top of that
alignment of planets

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
was mysteriously identified
with the celestial pole.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in
China they say Saturn

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:90%
ruled the celestial pole.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And the North
Pole being, I've heard,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Santa comes--
derives from there.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.489 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Well, Santa Claus
comes out of all of this, yeah.

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
This is like echoing through
history thousands of years

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.625 align:middle line:90%
The old father time, Santa.

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:16.624 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Father time.

00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And Saturn
is the father of time,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:90%
so that would be the North Pole.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: It's the
beginning of time.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And time begins with
events that were

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
centered on the celestial pole.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.902 align:middle line:84%
So get out of your
mind everything

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with things
you were taught in school.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
This is such a
radical perspective.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:90%
But there's one advantage.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is being
suggested here is testable.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
You can go look for it itself.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Saturn occupied
the celestial pole.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Go look it up.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Saturn was the ancient sun god.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Go look it up.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Shamash.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows Shamash is our
sun, the Babylonian sun god.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, except that
the texts themselves

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
say Shamash is
the planet Saturn.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's translated
as the sun god.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And the confusion
of sun and Saturn

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
is widespread in the ancient
world, particularly all

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
around the Mediterranean.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even Helios was the
name of Saturn originally.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:10%
So there's a mystery
to be resolved

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:10%
if we could just agree on that.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So your conception of
the ancient configuration was

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
basically the planets were
in alignment moving together

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
in essentially like a spiraling
wing around a central sun.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:90%
You could use that definition.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, the central sun, however--

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Is not in
our solar system.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: No, it was Saturn.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:90%
No, the central sun was Saturn.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Oh, so they were
spiraling around Saturn.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
These bodies were
moving around Saturn.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But the congregation was
maintaining an alignment.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is why the Babylonian
astronomer Berossus,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
he looks back to
an earlier time.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
in the beginning,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:90%
the planets stood in line.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Such that a straight line would
run through the heart that the

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:90%
gathered bodies.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.055 align:middle line:90%
Well, what gathered bodies?

00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:05.216 align:middle line:90%
What straight line?

00:11:05.216 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Would such--

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
would basically a disruption
of that configuration

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:84%
have created the
galactic shifts that

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:90%
have occurred on this planet?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.439 align:middle line:84%
We've seen, obviously, like
ice ages and tremendous--

00:11:15.439 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
we've seen destruction
of dinosaurs, right?

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
We've seen all these various
ages that have occurred.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Would that have-- could
have been possibly

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
because of the breaking
of official alignment?

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And I do use the world galactic.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Minor matter.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:90%
But this would not be galactic.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's within the solar
system around our sun.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And particular planets, gas
giants, and specifically

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
gas giants Jupiter
and Saturn, we're

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
very much involved in the
history of planet Earth

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the planets
were always celebrated

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:90%
as the gods, the great gods.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And the polar configuration
that I refer to in my work

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
is this alignment of planets.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
in line with the axis

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth itself.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, these bodies
are seen along the axis.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of the
axis, visually, was Saturn.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is why you can find
globally Saturn identified

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient sun god
and Saturn identified

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
with the celestial pole.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, just ask
yourself, right there.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're just walking
out of the gate right now.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But you have two utterly
preposterous ideas

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:90%
that are quite distinct.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Saturn was the ancient sun god.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Saturn occupied
the celestial pole.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.235 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Only in the assumption
that the sky has always looked

00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: There you go.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.253 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But going into
this question then of what

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.812 align:middle line:84%
the electric universe is,
many people have been taught,

00:12:37.812 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:84%
you said, throughout
our education.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Our education system teaches us
that space is sort of a vacuum,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that it's empty space
until you hit the next rock.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But the electric
universe indicates

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.995 align:middle line:84%
that there's electricity and
plasma that fills the spaces--

00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT:
Interplanetary space.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: --between
planets and the stars.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: And
intergalactic space.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And without plasma, we
wouldn't have the events

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.174 align:middle line:90%
we see in remote space.

00:13:01.174 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: And what is plasma?

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Explain what that means.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: It's just molecules,
protons and electrons with

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
separation of the
charged particles.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they're not just atoms.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're not just molecules.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.567 align:middle line:84%
They're just independently
moving charged particles.

00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: They have
an electric charge.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: They have a charge.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And they transmit charge across
any distance that you can name,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
including intergalactic
distances.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
at high energy events

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
in space, what you're
looking at is the effect

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
of charged particle motion on
a galactic scale being focused

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
down on galaxies and within
the galaxies on stars

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:90%
to light the stars.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the heart of
the electric universe model.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Stars are not little
thermonuclear furnaces.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been around the
electric universe community

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
enough now to see
that there's been

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:90%
lots of discussion of this.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And in my estimation, the
electric sun hypothesis

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.524 align:middle line:90%
wins on every test.

00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So this is huge
blasphemy in the scientific

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
community because the sun is
considered a mixture of nuclear

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
fission and fusion explosions
that are taking place.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.891 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: At the
center of the sun.

00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:90%
And the heat is radiating out.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But we don't see the heat
radiating out from the sun.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:90%
We see something much different.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.687 align:middle line:84%
It gets colder as you move
outward from the core.

00:14:33.687 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And same thing with the surface.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
As you move out from the
surface, it gets cooler.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the sun is reacting
to an external electric field

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and charged particles
coming in and concentrating

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
in an electric
discharge, then you

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
have an explanation of
the anomalies of the sun.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know that the
defining attributes of the sun

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:90%
are actually all anomalous?

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do you know that--

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I said it gets hotter
as you get farther away

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
from the surface of the sun.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.367 align:middle line:84%
And the rotation of the plasma
is faster with distance.

00:15:08.367 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you imagine
something being stirred

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
from the center and
the outer rotation

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
is faster than the
close to the center?

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
These are the anomalies
of solar behavior.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are many others

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that have attracted solar
physicists, and astronomers,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and scientists from essentially
every field to look at the sun

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and look at star formation
and galactic formation

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:90%
from a different vantage point.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Where the sea of
charged particles

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that makes up the
cosmos as a whole

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is driving the activity
that we observe.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is an electric
field of our sun

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that is an inescapable
conclusion from the idea

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that external charged
particles are actually acting

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:90%
to create solar behavior.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But then that requires
you to test the idea

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:90%
that there is a sun--

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the sun is at the center
of an electric field.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Is that plausible?

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing to look
at, because it's so, evident

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is, what happens to a
body when it plunges--

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
into-- from outside
the solar system

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.044 align:middle line:84%
when it plunges into this
electric field of the sun?

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Like a
comet or a meteor?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: It becomes a comet.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what you
would expect of a rock.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It can be just a rock.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be water.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But a rock a mile
or two in diameter.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
immediately adjust

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to the change in
the electric field

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's too large for that.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So the stresses build up
and it starts discharging.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an
oversimplified version

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of the comet in the
electric universe.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So your saying it
discharges energy as it goes?

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It discharges material
from its surface.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an electric discharge
because of the charge

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:90%
imbalance.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is all well within the
parameters of known science.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And now you see,
for the first time

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:10%
actually in modern
history of science,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:10%
you see scholars and scientists
actually seriously beginning

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.565 align:middle line:10%
to question the traditional
theory of comets

00:17:23.565 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:10%
as dirty snowballs.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
take us scientifically

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:90%
into an entirely new field.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And how does the
electric universe theory

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
challenge traditional Newtonian
physics of particular things

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
around gravitation
and things like this?

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: The traditional
theory of celestial dynamics is

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
so dominated by gravity.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%
People don't even think.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream does
not even discuss

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the electric force
and its possible contribution

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
to the events that we observe.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
If galaxies are being formed
out of the interaction

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of the charged particles
around that galaxy,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:90%
with the heart of that galaxy.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
feeding the galactic behavior.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
create structure.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, what would that
structure look like?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, for 50, 60, 70
years astronomers

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
who are receptive to the concept
of electricity and space,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:84%
they've been saying, these
galaxies are electrical.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
This is what electric discharge
in the laboratory looks like.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:10%
We might want to just talk
for a couple of minutes

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:10%
about our relationship
with Tony Peratt

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:10%
because he saw
what we were doing,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:10%
and became a part of our group,
and showed us what he and

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:10%
his laboratory at Los Alamos--

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:10%
he was really the most
distinguished plasma scientist

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And we came in to a beautiful
convergence with him

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
because he liked
everything he saw.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
He even like my
reconstruction of the stuff

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
seen in the ancient sky.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.769 align:middle line:84%
Because he saw it
in his laboratory.

00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: As far as he saw the
plasma formations that you were

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
describing?

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I was drawing out at a
symposium in September 2000.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:90%
We had invited him to come in.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.901 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawing
out for the audience

00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
these formations that we're
seeing in the ancient sky.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are familiar,
whorl-like images,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.645 align:middle line:84%
including the swastika,
and the whorl,

00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and different images of the--

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: The
ancient mythologies.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: The idea is the
whorling heart of heaven.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a separate
topic to take up,

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
but it's vast in
its implications.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:90%
But he saw all that.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And then he comes up to me.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
you have described

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what I've seen in
my laboratory experiments.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we became
really close then.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
He came up to Portland.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
He began expeditions
to chronicle rock art

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
across the Western
US, and Europe,

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%
and elsewhere, South America.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:10%
To show that people were carving
on stone these very formations.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: That are plasma
explosions in the sky?

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: And he says
these formations are electric

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:90%
discharge formations.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I can vouch for that from
photographs in the laboratory

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:90%
at Los Alamos.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%
So that became--

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he began going
out into the field

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and chronicling these
and publishing them

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:90%
in peer-reviewed journals.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever hear
about any of this.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But within our group, this
was a spectacular breakthrough

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And just to clarify,
I understand plasma meaning

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.104 align:middle line:90%
the fourth state of matter.

00:20:50.104 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Basically, an electrically
charged gaseous state.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just neutral gases--

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
neutral molecules
And so on and atoms.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:90%
It involves dissociated atoms.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
That means atoms dissociated
into their separate charged

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:90%
particles.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it a
very conductive medium.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can run a
current through it

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.745 align:middle line:84%
and create these
kinds of formations.

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: These connections.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious because of
solar flare activity.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
People have-- there are a lot
of theories about the nature

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:90%
of solar flares.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.149 align:middle line:84%
That we know the sun's
activity intensifies

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
over certain periods of
time when the solar flare

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:84%
activity increases or decreases,
right, these emissions.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And it can relate to everything
from psychological behavior

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.962 align:middle line:84%
on Earth to potentially climate
and environmental changes.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
What would that--
would that play--

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
how does that play into the
electric universe theory?

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.607 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Let's
put it this way.

00:21:42.607 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Number one, this isn't my field.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But I am aware of people
who investigate this

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and are drawing some
conclusions about solar behavior

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and emotional responses
from human beings.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just say that
seems so plausible to me

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
because we live in a
totally connected universe.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
contributions of our community

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to the advances in
science is that we

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
have brought an emphasis
on plasma's contribution

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of connectivity.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So starting on a galactic,
intergalactic scale,

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
our solar system,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
down to the electric
Earth, and then

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.699 align:middle line:90%
down to biological systems.

00:22:29.699 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Well, the blood cells.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:90%
We have plasma--

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: They call
plasma in our blood.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Yeah
that's called plasma.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to confuse
it with space plasma.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Metaphorically, it
could be connected in so far

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:90%
as--

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: There might
be a kind of metaphoric

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know people are
examining bioelectricity.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We've had good relationships
a couple-- with a couple

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of real pioneers in that field.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And bioelectricity is simply
emphasizing that really no man

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:90%
is an island.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So the electricity that we
exhibit within our bodies

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is actually not stopping
at the edge of our body.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's put it that way.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.354 align:middle line:10%
Human connectivity is an
essential foundational

00:23:19.354 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:10%
principle of the electric
universe group as a whole.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And it ties in
very well with the ancient

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:90%
principles of qi.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.619 align:middle line:90%
Energy that flows within--

00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: I would presume so.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have no expertise
on that subject at all.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:90%
But I do think so, yeah.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But also
this issue of, again,

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the universe
that's completely connected

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
by the electrical
and plasma forces.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Plasma basically,
that's connecting

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:90%
the spaces between us.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Many people who talk
about paranormal activity

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
have linked it to
plasma, and electricity,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
electrical discharges, and
paranormal phenomenon that

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.466 align:middle line:84%
appear in the electrical
forms, for example.

00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any thoughts on
the supernatural implications

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:84%
of what an electric
universe could bring?

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Intuitively, I
believe we will discover more

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and more at the
subtle energy level.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's at that
subtle energy level

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're exploring
and confirming

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of
human connectivity.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of this in some
way arises the deepest level

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:84%
of connection you
would want to explore.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the
deepest connection

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:84%
between human beings, which
would be closest to reality

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:84%
actually then the
surface, the phenomena?

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end, my guess
is that bioelectricity

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and the electric
universe as a whole

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
will come together in some
kind of grand synthesis.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be extravagant
in the thoughts about this.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I was going to ask.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's go for it.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that the
electric universe theory

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
will help us get
to what Einstein

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.126 align:middle line:84%
was looking for when he
said he wanted to find

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:90%
the theory of everything?

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: I'm not able to
given any authoritative answer

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's intuitive.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
the intuitive sense

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I have of things
coming together,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
we're moving toward a
more unified picture

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
of human existence and of
the cosmos, human existence

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
cosmos, and connectivity

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
becoming increasingly
impactful on the sciences.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing is
more important to us

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
than the sense of we are one.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is where human
consciousness is going.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is more powerful
in human consciousness

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:90%
than this idea.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not just isolated atoms
running around on planet Earth.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:90%
There is connectivity.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's worth
exploring scientifically.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would say that the
tools for that exploration

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.697 align:middle line:84%
are largely ahead of
us, not behind us.

00:26:06.697 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Well, how do we prove--

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing
I have to wonder

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
is if we have these
craft going into space,

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and we have astronauts
and cosmonauts,

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
why is it that we can't
prove electricity in space

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.332 align:middle line:90%
definitively at this point?

00:26:19.332 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Well, I think we
in our group proved it several

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%
times over.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But what will constitute proof
when you're in discussion

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
with people who are
working with an entirely

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:90%
different framework.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, if the sun is
an electric discharge,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that means it's being acted
upon by its larger solar system

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And that makes the--

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that basically establishes
logically then the principle

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:90%
of an electric universe.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with galaxies.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
If galaxies are
exhibiting formations

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that are seen in the
laboratory, but you could only

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:84%
do that with a contribution of
plasma from outside the galaxy.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now we're into
vast regions of space.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But they still involve
the same contribution

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.460 align:middle line:84%
of a larger environment to
a focused energetic event.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so galaxies, stars
within the galaxies,

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
planets around the
stars, and so on,

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
all can be
legitimately identified

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:84%
as evolving plasma
formations creating

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
physical phenomenon that we
only partially understand.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Could the electric
universe help explain some

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
of the ET phenomenon
that have been described?

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and things like this?

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
The ability to travel across
great distances through space?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: Is I think
so a good enough answer?

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Because people are speculating
on this all the time.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I've done-- I've put my years
of time in on the ET question

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I generally have not talked
about it within our group.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But when I get out
of the constraints

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of the electric
universe community,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind saying
that it isn't even

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.150 align:middle line:90%
a question in my mind.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.682 align:middle line:90%
Of course ETs exists.

00:28:08.682 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: This is
just a hypothesis.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.389 align:middle line:84%
But do you think that the
government or certain people

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
within NASA or
higher levels already

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.994 align:middle line:90%
know the universe is electric?

00:28:16.994 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: It's interesting how
certain questions come up where

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I never think that they've been
prompted by anything we said.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.240 align:middle line:90%
But I mean yes.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The government-- can I put it in
even in a conspiratorial sense?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not-- I never
talk conspiracy theories.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just saying this.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't own this place, folks.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:90%
We just don't own this place.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And well, what am
I saying there?

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
yet what works

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
be behind the visible instances
of power, expressions of power.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
That is a question that is, in
my mind, completely legitimate.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.982 align:middle line:84%
But I do suspect we would
find things that surprise us.

00:29:04.982 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well, it seems to me
that the electric universe is

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.860 align:middle line:84%
an important theory for humans
to understand and grasp if we

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
want to empower ourselves to
basically not only recognize

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the matrix,
but also potentially to--

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: What's the matrix?

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.336 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding you.

00:29:20.336 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: The electrical matrix
that the prism does with--

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that don't tell us that there's
an electric matrix around us,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:26.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't tell us that.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: I don't know
anything about that.

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.521 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: It's the
invisible electric fence.

00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> TALBOTT: But I do know
that there are powers active

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:84%
If we knew everything
that was going on,

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we would be somewhere between
terrorized and just amazed.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And damned if I know
how to interpret it all.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not helpful to just divorce
yourself from events going on

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:52.430 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It is important that
we pay attention.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can't talk
about things I've

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
learned over the years except
that I could just say, yes.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I concur.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything is not in good order.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:10%
We are not entirely in
good hands, let's just say.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So I do--

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I indulge various
theories that people

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:84%
have brought into our
group and presented to us.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:90%
And I've looked at evidence.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who thinks everything
is A-OK on planet Earth

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:90%
is really not in the real world.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Not awake.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.576 align:middle line:90%
>> TALBOTT: Not awake.

00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:28.376 align:middle line:90%
Good phrase for it.

00:30:28.376 --> 00:30:30.417 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAN: And that's all
the time we have for this

00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:10%
week's "Buzzsaw."

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.170 align:middle line:10%
You'll find everything
you need to further

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:10%
your understanding
of David's research

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:10%
and the electric universe
theory at thunderbolts.info.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:90%
