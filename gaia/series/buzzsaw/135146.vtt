00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN STONE: In the
beginning was the word.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.076 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:05.076 --> 00:00:07.044 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:10%
is Eric Rankin,
one of the leading

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
researchers in sonic geometry.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:10%
He's written a best-selling
novel called "The Aquarians"

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and he's worked with some of
the world's leading physicists,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:10%
mathematicians, and
audio engineers.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Today he works with
us on revealing

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:90%
the messages of sonic geometry.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose I have to
start by asking you,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.564 align:middle line:90%
what is sonic geometry?

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ERIC RANKIN: You know,
it's a simple thing.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people have
been doing research.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know Michael
Tellinger's been on this show,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:90%
on this station.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And they reference geometry
and frequency maybe

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:90%
in the same sentence.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
But up until I did my
work four years ago,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
no one had said,
why don't we play

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
the numbers of geometry, meaning
the sum totals of their angles,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.854 align:middle line:90%
as frequency?

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that, something
really surprising came out.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It produced harmonics.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Not just harmonics,
but what we call

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
the most beautiful harmonics
in music is a major chord.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Sort of the la, la, la.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow, geometry
plays a major chord.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.715 align:middle line:84%
I ran to my computer
and I was like,

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I got to hear more of this.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.167 align:middle line:90%
I got to search YouTube videos.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I got to look it up.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find a single thing.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this is impossible
that this would not be known,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
something profound to me that
geometry reveals harmonics.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we say
the word harmony,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
we're not just
talking about music.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
harmonious system, things

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
communicating with themselves
in a harmonious way

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:90%
or living together harmoniously.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
So it was a big thing for me.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Your research began,
was it because of your work

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:90%
with dolphins?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Or how did you end up just
making these discoveries?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Yeah, my interest in
frequency primarily did start

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:90%
with dolphins.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the boating
industry, the yachting

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.134 align:middle line:84%
I was out in the water a lot
and encountering dolphins.

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's been in
the water with dolphins

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.216 align:middle line:84%
understands there's something
really going on there,

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
an intelligence behind the eye.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Their brains are
bigger than ours.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And as they engage,
I just wanted

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:90%
to learn more about them.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And they are truly
masters of frequency.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins and whales
have mechanics,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
physiological
mechanics, that we don't

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:90%
have to create ultrasound.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we learned
ultrasound from dolphins.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
When a woman goes and gets an
ultrasound of an unborn fetus,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that's dolphin technology of
making pictures out of sound.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So in some way,
that's the beginning

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:90%
of sonic geometry or sonic form.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And now it's become
more and more advanced.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
And we're just learning.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Every day now we're
learning more what sound is.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's the first
guy that I know

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.374 align:middle line:84%
of that said, if you
want to understand

00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the universe,
think of energy, frequency,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Mm-hmm.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was going to
ask you about that later.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But what we'll get
into first, though,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
is this in terms of the
notion of sonic and geometry.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It really reminds me of Masonry.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously the Masons
are very much into this notion

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:90%
of geometry.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
They were said to be the master
builders in terms of their lore

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and Masonic itself
indicates, is there

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
a sort of a sonic nature to
their understanding of how

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.472 align:middle line:90%
to construct geometry?

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Interesting.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I've never thought
of that in my life

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very familiar, to
the depths that a exterior

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
person like me wanting to
learn about Freemasonry,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
there is a secret
element to freemasonry.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But just the word
sonic, Masonic,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
would be in there,
quite possibly.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I tend to believe that
the Masons are holders

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of information, that they knew
the importance of geometrics,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was lots of,
just like Pythagoras did,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was a lot
of information contained

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
in every single geometric shape.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're just keeping
that information alive

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.177 align:middle line:90%
for us to catch up to.

00:03:58.177 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what I feel
is really happening

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
We are catching up
to the information

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
might have known.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, given your research into
the notion of sonic geometry

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and study of ancient
structures, for example,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
would that indicate that
these were constructed

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
along certain patterns
that indicated

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.694 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry, for example?

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Absolutely.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What is the correlation
between sonic geometry

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and sacred geometry?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Big.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:90%
There's a big relationship.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Because geometric
form, primarily,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
when we think of geometry, most
of us think in straight lines.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
All of the platonic
solids, which

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
are the foundational building
blocks of nature and things,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:90%
are straight line geometry.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet nature doesn't use
straight lines very often.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
They use curved lines.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And curve is what
frequency it looks like.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you start,
there's an artist

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:84%
named Michael Evans who's been
holding this image of a seed

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:90%
pod geometry.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:10%
And actually, your logo,
Gaia's logo, of the core,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:10%
of the flower of life,
the seed of life,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:10%
has tons of
information in there.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
it has always been,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.155 align:middle line:84%
much like in the
movie "Contact" where

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
we were receiving information
and we couldn't decipher it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted
to make it flat,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
as soon as it became
dimensional, we understand it.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that that
template of sacred geometry

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
is informing a three
dimensional, four

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
dimensional structure that
is, if Buckminster Fuller was

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
correct, is the core
essence of everything.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like the nature of
nature is hexagonal or 60

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
degrees of arc.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.927 align:middle line:84%
Arc, of course, being in
that sacred geometry flower.

00:05:37.927 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're moving is we're

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing the similarities
between the form of frequency

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:90%
and the form of geometry.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And sacred geometry is
beautiful because it has arc

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:90%
built into it.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So would sonic geometry
correlate to, for example,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
what's called the music of the
spheres and the correlation

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:84%
of various planets
within solar systems?

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
They have a certain
distance, there's

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
a certain frequency of
patterns and vibration.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So is this essentially
what sonic geometry

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is about is trying to decipher
the essential correlations that

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:90%
exist within nature?

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Absolutely.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.055 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gone down
the path of-- it

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
was Pythagoras who
came up with that term,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:90%
the music of the spheres.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was referring to
the patterns of planets

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
orbiting the sun
and thinking there

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
was information revealed there.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
My work has just more
or less been, like

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
what you referenced, systemic.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
That there is a
system to nature.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The way a seed grows and
it contains the information

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
how to become whatever
unique plant it is

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:90%
or how we become unique.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
That informational field,
there's physicists now

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that believe there is a field
of information all around us

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of draw
this as a toroidal field.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Earth has a toroidal field
like a magnetic field

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and it has a
zero-point and it has

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe even a black hole at the
bottom of it and sprouts again,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:90%
that all of nature has that.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And that sacred
geometry informs that.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Because right in the middle of
the flower of life, your logo,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%
we start growing out.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then if you follow those
circles, it comes back in.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
something so deep revealing.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And there is frequency
related to it.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Like just a circle
itself, if we take

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
a circle is 360 degrees,
which most people know,

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
you can play 360 cycles
per second and get a tone.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
When it gets really
interesting is

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
overlaying other geometric
forms as number sequences

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies
and realizing there

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
is harmonics built into
the structure of what

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.995 align:middle line:90%
we call nature unfolding.

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:45.795 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:07:45.795 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And what is the
fourth three two key?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Four three two is
quite the deep rabbit hole.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's called
Pythagorean tuning.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Because Pythagoras saw
the number four three two.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It can also be called
concert pitch tuning.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Which, we tune our
instruments, we

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
have to have a
singular note that we

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
tune all the other notes
in an instrument around.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Today it's 440.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a guitar
shop, music store,

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and say I want a
tuner, somewhere on it,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:90%
it will say 440.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
That means 440 vibrations
cycles happening

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.406 align:middle line:90%
in the span of a second.

00:08:18.406 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't always been that.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, we have
always tuned their instruments

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:90%
around the area of that note.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Pre World War II-ish
era, 1935, instruments

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:90%
were detuned slightly.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
And people think,
the conjecture is,

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that they sounded better,
warmer and that we resonated.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies, something
about it, resonated more

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:90%
with this 432 tuning.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, right
when electronics

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%
was able to make
music and recordings

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
available to the
masses, a decision

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
was made to let's tweak
tuning a little bit.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Beyond just the
tuning and what it

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
might mean to us
hearing as frequency,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of numerical
information in a tuning grid.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Every tone has its number
correlation to frequency.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you are in
432, tons of numbers

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
come out that are
illogically there.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The diameter of the sun,
the diameter of the moon.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Buckminster Fuller's numbers.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
These correlative pieces of
information that you would not

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:90%
expect to find are there.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you were, I'm not
going to say Illuminati,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
but if you were
someone realizing

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is information
in this tuning grid,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
all you'd to do is
tweak it a little bit.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
The mass public will
never know and yet you

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:84%
held on to the information
and nobody else had it.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
but I do think it's interesting
that the moment we were

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
able to put music out
to the masses, it got

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:84%
changed right about
that time frame.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Nazis, I
think, were the first ones

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.101 align:middle line:84%
to adopt that shift
from 432 to 440 hertz.

00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:57.391 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Definitely involved.

00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:58.249 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Because it became
an international standard.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Before that,
different countries,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
because people weren't traveling
around much before the 1920s

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
or so, there had to become
an international standard.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So someone playing a tuba here
would take his tuba to Europe

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and it'd still be in tune.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Obviously we know
that water has been affected

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
by sound, vibration, music
affects the structure of water

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:84%
molecules, so it obviously
affects our very nature.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
How can music or
sound be weaponized,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
as biblical accounts of the
fall the walls of Jericho,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: That is
a great example.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They said in that
biblical verse,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
there is nothing but sound.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:84%
They walked around Jericho
blowing trumpets for days.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
there was just fatigue

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and the walls collapsed.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Sound is everything.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Sound is not only the creation.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Sound is potentially the
destruction of things.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Entropy and frequency,
where frequency waves just

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
either lose their natural
pattern or decay, which sound

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
eventually does decay,
could be literal decay

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:90%
of material matter.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's no conjecture to say
could frequency not only be

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
the creation of matter, but
the destruction of matter?

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you understood it, you
could be possessing something

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
very powerful for sure.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So in terms
of your research,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
do we believe that sound
can be utilized for healing?

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Even sacred geometry or certain
sonic geometry locations

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that, in the past,
for example, people

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
said the pyramids, for
example, held within them

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.360 align:middle line:84%
this tremendous healing
function because of the geometry

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:90%
of their construction.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And potentially then
utilizing whether it

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
be music and sound
or other material

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:90%
to create a certain harmony.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Do we believe that
this can be the future

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.692 align:middle line:90%
of healing for human beings?

00:11:48.692 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Not only the
future, but I think the past.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think we
are not in access

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of the technology
that people building

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid of
Giza, or these frequency

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
machines that even Egyptologists
now are saying they weren't

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
ever tombs, they were
machines of some sort,

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and they were machines that
used frequency and possibly were

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
built by utilizing
frequency of some sort.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a fundamental thing
when we talk about frequency

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and pure harmonics.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
should probably cover

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is that when you overlay
the tones of geometry,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
you get perfect
harmonics, a numerically

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
perfect, mathematically
perfect formula

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
to reveal perfect harmonics.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Not only in this new tuning
system that we have of 440,

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
we have, in our infinite
wisdom as human beings,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
we have tweaked every
note around them.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:90%
We have fractionalized them.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a process called
equal temperament.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So they sound good
enough to our ear,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
but a frequency is supposed
to be doing something

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:90%
else to us and for us.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a good chance that
out of seven billion people

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, no
one has ever heard

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
numerically perfect harmonics.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
If I were to play you a
sine waves a D major chord

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that you would sit down
at a piano and play, when

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
it's pure frequency, you
hear this weird warble.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's almost annoying.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
When you play it
as pure frequency,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
mathematically perfect, it
just hums perfectly along.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's very possible that music
today, as we have constructed

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:90%
it to be, is agitating us.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Even meditative music and
calming music deep at its core

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.419 align:middle line:90%
is actually agitating us.

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So let's go to
these ancient structures.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned the Giza pyramids.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
that sonic geometry

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:90%
is part of their construction?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
What are the ratios
and major numbers

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:84%
involved that are
evidence of it?

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: So what
really comes through,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
how we think that this is
probably awareness of this

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
system of frequency and
vibration and harmonics,

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:90%
is the numbers revealed.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We can't prove yet
what is happening

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Although it's interesting.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Musicians have gone in there.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Steve Halpern is a
well-known musician.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.149 align:middle line:84%
He went in there and
just banged his hand

00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
against what's called
the sarcophagus

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid
itself made a tone

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:90%
that ended up being 432 cycles.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible
how this might be.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's in the structures
and the mythologies

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and the stories and the temples
all over the world, including

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry, that are giving
us number sequences as if they

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
knew before they could logically
know how frequency manifested

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.222 align:middle line:84%
in numbers, vibration cycles
per any measurement of time.

00:14:29.222 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
None of that could
have been known,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and yet we have old documents.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
We have one of the oldest
documents ever written,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerian king's
list, written

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
in the world's first
written language, cuneiform.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us in
order to 288, 360, 432.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a numerically
perfect harmonic chord

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
as revealed by geometric
forms or as revealed

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
by a natural growth pattern
like the Fibonacci sequence.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It is all around us.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally it's like "The
Matrix" where the matrix

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:90%
was scary in the movie.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But we have this sense that
there is an order and a beauty

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and the harmonic nature
of everything around us.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But instead of being
something scary and dark,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
it is beautiful and
engineered and designed.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
want to use the word God,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
but there is an
intelligence to it.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And physicists like
Nassim Haramein

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
would be a great
example of saying

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be an overlying
intelligence behind everything.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
That energy is, as
it spins like this,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
every time it goes into
itself and out again,

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
is going out into the
informational field

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and coming back and learning
more and more and more

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.975 align:middle line:90%
with each pass, almost.

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been a
rabbit hole of four years

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
that I have gone down.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a
physics degree, so

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that I sit on roundtable
discussions and brain trusts

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
with people that have Stephen
Hawking on their speed dial

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and can talk about these
things blows my mind.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is a missing
piece of the puzzle.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it almost had
to be an outsider like me

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
with some musical
background, some science

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:84%
background, some interest,
and follow through and see

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
that there are all these
elements that want to click

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.689 align:middle line:84%
and they click
beautifully together.

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to massage them.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to ask
somebody to believe it.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They just do this
in a beautiful way.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I talk
about all the time.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what I lecture
about in mostly California

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is this amazing how nature
is revealing truly harmonics.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Right.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Well in terms of you mentioned
the Sumerian King's list

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned
outside intelligence.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And that does bring
us to the question

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
that obviously many people
have wondered about,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
which is this notion
of in the Bible

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
it's God, in the Sumerian
texts they're Annunaki,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
but some kind of alien
beings that do give us

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and help us in the
construction of these sites

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps in knowing
these sacred numbers

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and this sacred geometry
and the sonic reality,

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.322 align:middle line:84%
let's say, underlying
our experience.

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
What evidence do we
have that there could

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:90%
be some alien involvement?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: The information
is so big that it's almost

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:90%
the elephant in the room.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't start out as an
ancient alien theorist at all.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I became aware of this
co-relational aspect

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
of geometry and frequency.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And it led me down a
path that guided me

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
to we all know a
circle is 360 degrees.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Why is it 360 degrees?

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.587 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:17:30.587 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Why do we count
certain things the way

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:90%
we do, by factors of 12s or 60s?

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
12 months a year, 60
seconds to a minute,

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
60 minutes to an hour.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That all came from
one place in one time.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And the story of how the
world got its first written

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:84%
language, a unique math
system that we still

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
use today that is the basis
of geometry, and 60 degrees,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning the Gaiam circle
is 60 degrees of arc.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a circle
to build sacred geometry.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You need to know that it's
1/6 of a circle that's

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:90%
really informing it.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The first wheeled
and axled vehicle.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:90%
The first pyramid structure.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:90%
The first sailboat.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:90%
The first pottery wheel.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:90%
The first loomed weaved fabric.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff happened
in one place in one time

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and the people wrote in
cuneiform, this first written

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And we got to wonder, how in one
place in one moment in history

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
did we make these not
advances in technologies,

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
the arrival of technology
that we are just improving on?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We're still driving around in
wheeled and axled vehicles.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And the people of the day
said, we were visited.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
This intelligence that had
more information than we do

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
shared it with us and shared it
in ways that we could factor.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And they gave us
a counting system

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that is not base 10,
which would make sense

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:90%
since we have 10 fingers.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It was counting up
to 12 on one hand

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and then holding it five times
on the other hand to get to 60.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
So there's 12.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:90%
12, 24, 36, 48, 60.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like they gave us

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
a little time released
pill of information

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that we could work with
back then and carry

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
6,000 years into the future and
realize it's still holding up.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci
saw sacred geometry

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
in three dimensions
500 years ago.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It's almost his
most relevant work.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It was just sketches on paper.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But his other
inventions were limited

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to the building
materials at hand

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
or the day, wood and
rudimentary metals.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But we see that he saw
this same geometric form

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
in 60 degrees of
arc, understanding

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
there is something there,
something latent hidden

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:90%
in our awareness.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was hinted at and
actually provided to us

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
by these on Annunaki visitors.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So did they come in
ships or was just

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
downloads of
information, visions?

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
This idea that heavenly visitors
came to us, it's in the Bible.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Heavenly visitors came to us.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They mated with
our earthly women.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
Nephilim in the Bible.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But these stories
are there giving us

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and you start the show
with in the beginning

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
there was the word, almost
meaning like in the beginning

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
it was sound that started
everything into being.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a logical thing to say.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.832 align:middle line:90%
Any physicist would say yes.

00:20:10.832 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And what
do we make, then,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan disappearance?

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Could that be reflective of
the knowledge and the awareness

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that they were given or
downloaded or achieved

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.869 align:middle line:84%
that may have contributed to the
disappearance of that culture?

00:20:21.869 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: I think
any disappearance,

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
including our potential
disappearance,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:84%
is having the awareness and
acting out of accordance with

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So whether it was the
Egyptians or the Romans

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
or the Greeks or the
Mayans or possibly us.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Neil deGrasse Tyson says if
a visiting culture came down

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in our planet, their
field report would say,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
they're the species that knew
one thing and did another.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So for a while, we seem to
work with the information

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and then we go, we
got it from here.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:90%
We'll start our own way.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's tuning
our instruments musically

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:84%
or building a certain way or
whatever it is how we manage,

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
we seem to take
ourselves off the path,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's when we fail.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
that we had to fail.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's our own
smugness, our own ego,

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
that gets in there.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like we've become the gods.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it our way.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And we're not.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We should be participating
in the grand system.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Well certainly the
Mayans predicted some sort

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of end of an age and coming
new age and this great year

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:90%
concept.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.013 align:middle line:84%
So where do we fit
in this great year?

00:21:24.013 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean for
where we are today?

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Well, it's
fascinating that the Mayans

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
came up with this end
of the calendar day,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
which my book was a lot about.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It was about the
December 21, 2012

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
end date, which the Mayans never
saw as the end of the world.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It was like an odometer clicking
over to a new age of awareness.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, fascinating
that if they wrote

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that 900 years ago
without seeing anything

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
where we went digitally
or information

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
age, that right in that window,
if you bracket December 21,

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
2012 till 10 years before
and 10 years after,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about a
profound shift in the way we

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
access information,
share information,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:84%
are becoming aware
of certain aspects.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a show like this where
it's not run by a mainstream

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:90%
media conglomerate.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It's people that want to
dive deeper into some truths

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and have a logical conversation
about certain things.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a growing
number every day.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
For all of the fear
and the negative stuff

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
planet, there are

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
people that just
almost wake up and go,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
there's something way deeper
going on here and I feel it.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
access it, but I feel it.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even just seeing
images like the flower of life

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:90%
is a trigger point.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And we go, I got to
learn more about this.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And towards that
end, I really wonder,

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
does perhaps surrounding
ourselves with sacred geometry,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
does being immersed
within sonic geometry,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:84%
does that potentially activate
our interaction with alien

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
entities, for example?

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.751 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Well, here's the
thing that I think is quite

00:22:53.751 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
possible what perfect
harmonics may do.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Because perfect
harmonics are also

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
revealed by the
Fibonacci growth cycle.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to
reveal either anything

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
from as small as a snail
shell to our ear design

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:84%
to our hand design, this
spiral, to a galaxy.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
This spiraling design
is fundamental in much

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of what
we know to be creation.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
All things, whether it's life
forms or stars or planets.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And that reveals a certain
set of frequencies.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
We happen to have another
Fibonacci organ in our body

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's this gland that
some people have heard of,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:90%
the pineal gland.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's dead center
in our brain, right

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.341 align:middle line:84%
behind what some cultures
have seen as a third eye.

00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Some certain people, like
Alex Grey, artists or people

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that go on plant medicine
journeys, ayahuasca,

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:90%
or mushrooms.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And they talk
about seeing a grid

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or seeing deeper into the
structure of what nature really

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
How much sense does it make that
numerically perfect Fibonacci,

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
let's call them, harmonics are
passing through your Fibonacci

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
ear canal and accessing your
Fibonacci organ in your brain

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:90%
to help you see, yes?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Truly, it's almost, again, like
a time released pill of sorts.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Information that if you get it
right, the rewards are huge.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
to see the matrix

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and see how you
participate in it

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and see how you are
either a healthy cell

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
in the whole system
of things or how,

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, what we are
is kind of cancerous cells

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.532 align:middle line:84%
to the healthy system
of life on this planet.

00:24:28.532 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You mentioned
earlier the Tesla quote,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:84%
which is wonderful, about how we
should think about the reality

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
in terms of energy,
frequency, and vibration.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So how can our understanding
of sonic geometry

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:84%
be used potentially
to broadcast energy,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, as I know Tesla
wanted to do and to transform

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.924 align:middle line:90%
our reality?

00:24:44.924 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: My guess is that
where we're going to see

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the biggest scientific
breakthroughs will be

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:90%
in the form of ultrasound.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That means we can't hear it.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
But the guideposts,
the number sequences

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that have been left behind
by our ancestors and maybe

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
these sky visitors
at time, happen

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:90%
to be in the audible range.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually quite
phenomenal that geometry,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:84%
as it was given to us,
Sumerian based 60 geometry,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
is in the low hundreds.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.261 align:middle line:84%
200, 300 400, up to
about low thousands.

00:25:16.261 --> 00:25:17.260 align:middle line:90%
We can hear comfortably.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:84%
That's like sitting
down at a keyboard

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and following this
three octaves right

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the keyboard.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
All these number sequences,
Joseph Campbell encountered

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:31.202 align:middle line:84%
432, this number so often in his
mystical studies of mythologies

00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and the hero's journey and all
these things, four three two

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:90%
came up.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.945 align:middle line:84%
Four three two
just happens to be

00:25:35.945 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
of this system.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think what they
are are guideposts.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:90%
We hear them.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
We're affirmed that they're
correct because they

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:90%
sound beautiful to us.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think octaving them up,
meaning doubling, next higher

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%
frequency, doubling
again until we're

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
in ultrasound,
which is doubling,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
doubling, doubling
maybe 10, 20 times

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
until you're in the
tens of thousands

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies, which is where
we can start vibrating things

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
apart, where dolphins can
create 3D holographic picture

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:90%
languages.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you start wrong
and keep doubling,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
you're way wrong by the time
you've doubled up 20 times.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think what these
frequencies are actually

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
guiding us to are like
guideposts to our ears,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to our consciousness, where
we can play them as music.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
supposed to be doing

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in the experimental
realm, in the science,

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:24.549 align:middle line:90%
is in the ultrasonic realm.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're already talking
about levitating things

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:90%
with sound we can do.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.559 align:middle line:84%
We had an amazing lab
session with cymatics.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if anybody's
ever talked about where

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:90%
sound reveals certain patterns.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.975 align:middle line:84%
And when we played that ancient
set of frequencies, 280, 360,

00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
432, we got something
that we had never

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
seen in cymatic research that
looked like a flower of almost

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:90%
like a gas bloom.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible, really.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The scientists that we
were working with was like,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I have not seen this before.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost informing us
yes, these frequencies matter.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.155 align:middle line:90%
Energy, possibly.

00:27:00.155 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:90%
All these different things.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is in the
realm of ultrasound.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But if we get it wrong and keep
doubling, we will be way wrong.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So you mentioned
zero-point energy earlier.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what does that mean
exactly and is that something

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that we should look to
achieve towards our energy's

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.006 align:middle line:90%
sustainability in the future?

00:27:17.006 --> 00:27:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> RANKIN: Zero-point energy is
the fundamental building block.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds
complicated, but everybody

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:90%
knows what an atom looks like.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.609 align:middle line:84%
It has that little
dot in the middle

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and we see these
rings going around it.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That's a little
zero-point energy field.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There's an idea now in physics
that that zero-point phenomenon

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:90%
is everything.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
From our chakra
system, a lot of people

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
have seen that we
have this, it's

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
called the toroidal field,
where right in the middle of us

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.665 align:middle line:90%
is this energy system.

00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out and then it
comes back and loops into us.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what informs this
spiraling shape all the way out

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:90%
to the galactic level.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
that we get that information

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:90%
correct and understand it.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's that energy
has a core point

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to be its own
little perpetual motion energy

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
The glass here, this
was sand at one point.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The atoms that made it sand
are still those same atoms.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They're reformed
and restructured,

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
but they're the same little
atomic zero-point energy fields

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
running a long, long time.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This glass would last hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:84%
If it weren't broken,
this glass would last.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So that same little energy
thing, that little energy

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:90%
module, is doing its thing.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
If we could harness that and
make our own zero-point energy

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:84%
devices, we're talking
about free energy.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Tesla
was talking about.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he
got kind of shut down

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is he was financed by JP
Morgan and Westinghouse.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was
great until he said,

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
this could be free
without wires.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, well where
do we make money in that?

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled
all his financing

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.999 align:middle line:84%
and he ended up dying
penniless in New York.

00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what it seems to
me is that we're saying is

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.050 align:middle line:84%
ultimately our reality
is very much dictated

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:84%
by the geometries, the
sonic vibrations frequencies

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:84%
of music, of
language, of verbiage,

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
of media that surrounds
us in our consciousness.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And right now it seems that
our world has very much

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
been controlled by
people that want

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to use this grid matrix
for purposes of control,

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:90%
empowerment, enslavement.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we can utilize the
teachings of the ancients

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of harmonics,
of zero-point energy,

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of vortical,
cyclical energy,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
we can actually work
to sort of re-balance

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:84%
our system of
ecology, of ourselves,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to each other,

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and our power structures.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> RANKIN: Yeah.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
only honor the idea

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that there have been a few that
are aware of this information

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and are lording it,
keeping it to themselves,

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and keeping us in the dark.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It could just as easily,
and probably more likely be,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
we just drifted off and
away from the information

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
on our own devices
in our own ignorance,

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
like falling asleep or
becoming amnesiac a bit.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:90%
That information was there.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It does powerful things.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, we
still drifted away from it.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's into
this information,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely
been societies

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that are aware of geometry
and the power of it,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:90%
what it may reveal, for sure.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But are they intentionally
holding it away from us,

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:90%
depriving us of it?

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Or are they maybe
even holding it for us

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:90%
until we're ready for it again?

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that we
are functioning out

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:90%
of a state of harmonics.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras 2,000,
2,500 years ago,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
he understood numerically
perfect harmonics.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
He divided strings
into segments.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And they were
mathematical formulas

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and what he would have heard
would have been mathematically

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:90%
perfect.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
If we had built from that and
never let this string deviate

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:84%
from what he first saw,
we would be way far ahead

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:90%
of where we are now.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't do that.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We started making musical
instruments more complicated

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and having to fudge notes so
they, in just music alone,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:90%
sounded OK.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And what frequency
does, say frequency

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:84%
does all these things, music
is this little band right here.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's an audio
engineer and says

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of all the things
frequency does,

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:90%
music is the least important.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Yet it's what we
surround ourselves with.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.762 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you cannot
escape music anymore.

00:31:26.762 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Imagine going back 100 years.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.344 align:middle line:84%
The only music
you ever heard was

00:31:29.344 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
music that was performed,
either by you or somebody else.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
There weren't replays and
it wasn't surrounding you

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we're potentially
in this field,

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:84%
surrounding ourselves
with music that

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:84%
is agitating us because it is
not pure tone, pure harmonic.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully the work that I'm
doing with some amazing people

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that are seeing this as well
is going to kind of-- there's

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
a big move of turning
music back to 432 tuning.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:90%
That is about a halfway step.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get away from
the fractionalized tuning

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:90%
of all the other notes.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
But at least we do get to hear
that 432 and its octaves, down

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
as 216, up is 864,
down again is 108.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Here's a perfect
example of how humanity

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:84%
has been guided to
these number sequences

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.760 align:middle line:84%
that are pointing the
direction to frequency.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:84%
108 In Hindu religions,
mantra and mudras,

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.430 align:middle line:90%
are repeated 108 times.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Mala necklaces.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
have an answer for it.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They're just holding this
space, this awareness of 108.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Well 108 octave up is 216.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Octave up again, it's 432.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like we are programmed
a bit with this information

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it's
important and how

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:90%
it's important is frequency.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And beyond frequency is harmony.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%
How do they blend?

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And we've been programmed
for that as well.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
When you go to a movie and
you hear a major chord,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.510 align:middle line:84%
you know that everything's
going right in that movie.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:90%
They're getting back together.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Things are optimistic.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:84%
When you hear a minor
chord, danger is afoot.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit of
programming for us

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to associate meaning to
combinations of tones.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for joining me today, Eric.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.179 align:middle line:84%

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: And there
you have it, folks.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.851 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Eric Rankin.

Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:90%
along the edge of the Buzzsaw.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and you are the revolution.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:42.955 align:middle line:90%
