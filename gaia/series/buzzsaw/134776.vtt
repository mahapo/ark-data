>>SEAN STONE: The shadow
government, the Nazis,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Blond Ghost--
let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:10%
is Daniel Sheehan,
whose law career has

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:10%
covered some of the most
important cases of our time.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.942 align:middle line:84%
He's a Harvard Law graduate, who
has been involved with cases,

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
including the Pentagon
Papers, the Wounded Knee

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
occupation, the Watergate
burglary, the Karen Silkwood

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
case but today, we'll be
focusing on the Enterprise.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start by
asking you-- tell me

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
about what the Enterprise was
because many people may have

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
heard of it in regards to Oliver
North's arming of the Contras

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
in 1980s and the
Iran-Contra scandal

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and some people know about
the cocaine side of things.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
But what was the Enterprise?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN: The Enterprise
was an ostensibly private, off

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:10%
the shelf, standalone,
self-financing covert

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:10%
operations enterprise.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It was created by a man by the
name of Theodore G. Shackley.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Theodore G. Shackley was the
ADDO, the Associate Deputy

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Director for
Operations of the CIA

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
in charge of all
covert operations

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
worldwide under
George H. W. Bush,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
when Bush was the
director of the CIA,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
appointed by Gerald
Ford, when Ford came in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
after Nixon resigned in 1974.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And Gerald Ford came in and
he selected George H. W. Bush

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to be the director of the
CIA right in the midst of all

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the major Senate special select
intelligence committee hearings

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
investigating the covert
activities of the CIA

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:90%
under Frank Church.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And when Bush came in, he
hand-picked this fellow,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Theodore Shackley, to come in.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, since he was in charge of
covert operations for the CIA,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
he was not a household name.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
He was not someone
that people knew about.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And where he had
come from, prior

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to becoming the director of
covert operations for the CIA,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
he had been the Director of
Operations in Southeast Asia.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that, he
had been the Director

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
of Operations in the
Western Hemisphere,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
choreographing the
overthrow of Allende

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
in Chile, the rise
of the fascists

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
into power in Argentina,
the whole rise of all

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
those fascist regimes all
through Latin America that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
became deeply involved
in the cocaine smuggling.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, that part
of his initial incarnation

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
was that he had been the
CIA Station Chief in Saigon

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:90%
during the Vietnam War.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
He is the one that set up the
connection between the opium

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
trafficking in southeast Asia
with a major opium warlord

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
called Vang Pao in Laos and
helping to secretly fund

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
a massive political
assassination program known

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:90%
as the Phoenix Project.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And they assassinated
anywhere from 20,000

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
non-combatant civilians,
if you accept the number

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Helms gave
to the Church Committee.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Many people argue
that they assassinated

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
closer to 100,000 non-combatant
civilians, town mayors, city

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
clerks, school teachers,
anybody that they thought

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
might be sympathetic to what
they viewed as the North

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Vietnamese agenda.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And so Shackley-- but
Shackley, his real deep history

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
Theodore Shackley

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
as a young
German-American English

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
speaker and German and Polish,
went into World War II.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
He as an American,
a young American.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
His parents came from
Germany and Poland.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And he went into the United
States Army in World War II

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and was assigned to the 101st
counter-intelligence corps.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of World War
II in Europe, in May of 1945,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
the Commander of the Third
Reich's anti-Soviet Union

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and anti-Eastern
Bloc intelligence,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
a fellow named Major General
Reinhard Gehlen turned himself

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:84%
into the 101st
counter-intelligence corps

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know,
I'm Reinhard Gehlen.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I've run the Third Reich's
anti-Soviet intelligence

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
for the entire duration
of the Third Reich.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm turning myself into you.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have you enter
into an agreement with me

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to let me head up German, West
German intelligence at the end

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of World War II in exchange for
which I want you to release,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
take off the Nuremberg war
crimes list myself and my 100

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:90%
top men.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I will run the
anti-Soviet intelligence

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
for the Western powers
after World War II.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And Theodore Shackley,
this young fellow

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
in the 101st
counter-intelligence corps

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
was assigned to be his
German-American translator.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout those
entire negotiations

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that went on in May of
1945 over in Germany,

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Shackley became closer
and closer to him,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:90%
doing the translating.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And then Reinhard
Gehlen, when they

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
realized what the asset
was that they had,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the OSS realized
what they had, they

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
shipped him to Fort Hunt
outside of Washington, DC.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And he spent three weeks
there with Theodore Shackley

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
being his German-American
translator,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
negotiating with the OSS and
the intelligence community

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
of the United States as to
what the conditions were

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
under which he was
going to now run

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
anti-Soviet intelligence for
the Western powers, which

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.404 align:middle line:90%
he did for 26 years.

00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So Shackley
was basically,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:84%
at that point, initiated
into the deep state,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:90%
as it's been termed.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the original
CIA guys, the guys like Dulles,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
right, and people around
the old OSS, who formulated

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.944 align:middle line:90%
the beginnings of the CIA.

00:05:58.944 --> 00:05:59.943 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Did Shackley
intersect at all

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
with the peoples that have been
associated with the Kennedy

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:90%
assassination, for example?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yes, because
one of the other incarnations

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
of Theodore Shackley
is that in 1961,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
right after the Bay of Pigs
fiasco in April of 1961,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
when the people in
charge of the Bay of Pigs

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
were removed by John
Kennedy, the CIA

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
brought in Theodore
Shackley, out of Germany,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
where he was in Berlin
under Reinhard Gehlen,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
where he had been
ever since 1947.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And brought him in to become
the Miami Station Chief.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And he ran the Miami station
and a covert operation

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:10%
called JMWAVE that was
the covert operation

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:10%
to try to overthrow Castro.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And even though
President Kennedy

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
promised Nikita Khrushchev
after the Bay of Pigs fiasco

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy was going to stop
any further covert operations

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:90%
against Cuba, it wasn't true.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy was just flat lying
to Khrushchev at the time.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they had operation
JMWAVE, this Operation

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Mongoose, they called
it, going in and trying

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to burn sugar fields and blow
up bridges and poison crops

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and poison sugar
shipments, actually,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:90%
that were going to Russia.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
All of this activity
was going on

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and Theodore Shackley
ran that whole operation.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, that just
prior to Kennedy coming in

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
as President, elected
in November of 1960,

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:84%
turns out that just
prior to that time,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
the Eisenhower/Nixon
administration was in charge.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
They had set up the
original covert operation

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
against Cuba as
of January of 1959

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
when Batista, the
dictator, was overthrown

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
by Fidel Castro and Raul Castro
and Che Guevara and the others.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
Richard Nixon, who

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
was chairing at
that time, a thing

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
called the 5412 Committee.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It was the subcommittee of
the National Security Council

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that was in charge
of covert operations

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
that were being promoted under
section 5414 of the National

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Security Act of 1947, that
they viewed as authorizing them

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:90%
to engage in covert operations.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So Nixon chaired that operation,
all the way from the creation.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, he came in in
1952 with Eisenhower,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
all the way through to 1960.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is, in June of 1960,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
when as soon as Nixon
realized that he

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the new nominee
for the Republican presidency,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
he contacted Howard
Hughes and Howard

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Hughes had been functioning
as a deep cover asset

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to the National Security
Council for covert operations.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
He was running a company
called the Summa Corporation

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and they built the
Glomar Explorer

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and a number of other very deep
and dark secret operations.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, he was tied to
the military industrial complex

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:90%
from World War II.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: He was, obviously,
building a lot of the planes

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and crafts for the war.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The C-5 cargo,
the big Spruce Goose.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So he's tied to the
national security state.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.709 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:08.742 align:middle line:84%
So when he went into seclusion
and everybody stopped

00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
seeing him in public,
running around Hollywood,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and doing movies and all
that, he went into seclusion,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:84%
running the Summa Corporation
for the National Security

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Council.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, he
had this relationship

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
with Richard Nixon, who's
chairing the 5412 committee.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as Richard
Nixon realized

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
he was going to be the new
nominee for the Republican

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Party, he contacted
Howard Hughes by safe fall

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
from the 1512
committee and asked

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Hughes to set up an
assassination team

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to assassinate Fidel
Castro and Raul Castro

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and Che Guevara and these
five other commandantes.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And Howard Hughes
assigned that job

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to a young lawyer on his staff
by the name of Robert Maheu.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Maheu was based in
Las Vegas, where Hughes was,

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
staying there at the
hotel in the penthouse.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Bob Maheu reached out
to Johnny Roselli--

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: The mafia.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.764 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Who was the bag
man in Vegas for Sam Giancana.

00:10:06.764 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: The
Chicago-based mobster.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Out of
Chicago, right?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:15.045 align:middle line:84%
And so, when Maheu approached
Johnny Roselli and said,

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
look it, Richard
Nixon who's going

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to now be the new
President-- because everybody

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
assumed he was going
to win the presidency.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
That he'd been in this
catbird seat for eight

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
years and this young
senator from Massachusetts,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
whose father bought him his
positions, as they viewed it,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to win.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So they all moved in behind
him and said, look it,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Nixon wants to have
this assassination

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:90%
deal put together.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
You guys-- referring
to the mafia

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that Roselli was part of-- have
your own reasons for wanting

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of Castro.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
He shut down all
of your casinos.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Shut down all of your
houses of prostitution.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, shut down
the heroin smuggling operation

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that was coming in through
Cuba out of the Southeast Asian

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:90%
triangle.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
That was all set up at
the end of World War II.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, sure
the French connection.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right, the
whole Corsican connection.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was coming into
Havana through a thing called

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the SEA Supply Corporation,
S-E-A, Southeast Asian Supply

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Corporation, run
by Paul Helliwell,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
full-time Central Intelligence
Agency, dental plan CIA guy,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
He was there and he ran
that entire operation.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
He was also legal counsel to
the National Bank of Miami

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
that was owned by Meyer Lansky,
the big mafia treasurer, right?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So that whole operation
was going on in Cuba

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's what Fidel Castro
knocked into [? Acanceh ? ]

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%
when he took over.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
He threw all those
people out of there.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:90%
They all came up to Florida.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So Johnny Roselli is being told
by Robert Maheu, you guys have

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
got your own reasons for
wanting to get rid of Castro

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
but now Nixon, who's
going to be President

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:90%
is asking you to do that.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And so Johnny Roselli
said, well, I've

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:90%
got to check with my principal.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So he goes back to Chicago
and to Sam Giancana.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Giancana says,
well, wait a second.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
This is Santo Trafficante's
territory down there.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
He's the head of
the mob in Havana.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's up in Tampa because
he fled in January '59

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:90%
when Castro took over.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:90%
So we go down to meet with him.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.968 align:middle line:84%
They said-- I get all
of this information

00:12:10.968 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:90%
from Trafficante directly.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
As it turned out, I was
one of the three trial

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:84%
lawyers in F. Lee Bailey's law
firm, criminal defense firm,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out, Trafficante
was one of our clients.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
So he briefed us on all of this.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.979 align:middle line:84%
And so they set
up-- he goes down

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and they have three meetings
at the Fontainebleau

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Hotel in July of 1960, now.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
This is when Nixon is still
Vice President under Eisenhower.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
three meetings

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to talk about setting up
this assassination team

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
but Trafficante says,
as he said to us,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't fall off no
melon wagon, he said.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, I wanted to make sure
that this was coming directly

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
from Nixon, not some brainstorm
of Howard Hughes or Robert

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Mayhew.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So they sent a person
to another meeting

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
they had who was using
the nom de guerre Mr. Ed.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It was Sheffield Edwards who
was the Chief of Security

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
for the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
under Richard Nixon
and Eisenhower

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and the CIA director Dulles.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Because Allen Dulles
had been brought

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in during the Eisenhower/Nixon
administration

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
to be the head of the CIA.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.801 align:middle line:84%
And the critical thing
to understand-- we

00:13:18.801 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
can get to that later-- but the
critical thing to understand

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason that
Allen Dulles was named

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
the Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
is because he was legal counsel
for Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And he was also--

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Which is George
Bush, Sr.'s father's bank.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: George
Herbert Walker.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
George Herbert
Walker was, in fact,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.204 align:middle line:84%
was the CEO of Brown
Brothers Harriman, OK?

00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: With
Prescott, his father.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Prescott
Bush was his son-in-law.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: No, his
father was Prescott.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.283 align:middle line:90%
George H.W. Bush's father.

00:13:47.283 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: George
H.W. Bush's father.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But George Herbert Walker,
it was his son-in-law,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Prescott Bush was
his son-in-law.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So George Herbert
Walker in 1924,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
ends up retiring as the head
of the Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
setting up the Union Bank of
New York, which then set up

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
the Bank of Commerce and
Trade up in the Netherlands.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Fritz Thyssen was
heading that up

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and financed the construction of
the international headquarters

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Reich in Berlin.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Fritz Thyssen wrote the
famous book, "I Paid Hitler"

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and said he backed him.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
we're looking at here

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is the connection that people
have always said, well,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.260 align:middle line:84%
how do you connect the
mafia, the CIA, the bankers,

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the President, how does
that all make sense?

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just outlined exactly
how all these things intersect.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.119 align:middle line:84%
Right Through Brown Brothers
Harriman and Allen Dulles.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Exactly and Dulles
being a founder of it,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.118 align:middle line:90%
as the godfather of it.

00:14:32.118 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, they set up an
assassination team.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.861 align:middle line:90%
None of this is disputed.

00:14:34.861 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
get rid of Castro.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: This has
now been revealed.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:90%
We found this out.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.082 align:middle line:90%
I found this out in May of 1973.

00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Yeah, but
this is-- no, I'm

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.956 align:middle line:84%
saying people
recognize that there

00:14:43.956 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
was assassination teams
trying to get rid of Castro,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
the Bay of Pigs operation
failed and all of that.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, your
argument is the secret team

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that was designed to initially
assassinate Castro was

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
ultimately turned on Kennedy.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:90%
They turned.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They turned on Kennedy
and killed him in Dallas

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
in November 1963 and
covered the entire thing up.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And Shackley was critical
to that because he

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
was the CIA Station
Chief in Miami

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and this operation, the S
Force-- they had a code name,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the S Force-- ran under his
control out of the Miami

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:90%
station, out of JMWAVE.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
key to understanding.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
He was taken out
of there in 1965

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
by LBJ, was sent into
Laos, and then into Saigon.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But so let's talk
about the notion of how

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:84%
these operations,
these black ops

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
are run, oftentimes,
using the drug traffic.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the mafia connection
is all about the drugs, right?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Utilizing the--

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: And assassinations.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: The mafia tie in.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: And assassinations.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.781 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: OK, for assassinations.

00:15:42.781 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Key, the
key linkage there.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Exactly, but
obviously, the drug traffic

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:90%
is integral to that.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So what Shackley was
doing in '65 to '73, when

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.314 align:middle line:84%
he's in Vietnam,
in Southeast Asia--

00:15:54.314 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Laos and Vietnam.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.313 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: He's basically
overseeing and making

00:15:57.313 --> 00:16:00.574 align:middle line:84%
sure that the heroin traffic
continues unimpeded and expands

00:16:00.574 --> 00:16:01.615 align:middle line:90%
right out of that region.

00:16:01.615 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The US now gets more
flow of money from that.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And then that
money is ultimately

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
utilized for off the
books type of operations.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Initially
his operation,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Shackley's operation with
Vang Pao, that whole operation

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
was specifically
being used to fund

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the Phoenix Program, this
massive assassination program.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they were taking
funds, extra funds from that

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and moving them into a special
bank they created, the Nugan

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Hand Bank over in Australia.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And Richard Secord and
a fellow of the name

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of Carl Jenkins, who was
the liaison between Shackley

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and Vang Pao in the CIA,
Secord and Carl Jenkins

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
would carry the money
in suitcases, cash,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
over to the Nugan Hand Bank
and opened up that bank.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was the money--
part of that money

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
was used by Shackley in 1980
to come into the United States

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and fund the campaign
against Frank Church,

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Dick Clark in Iowa, Bayh, Birch
Bayh in Indiana and Cranston

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
in California and George
McGovern in South Dakota.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to kick them out of office.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.343 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because they had been
running the committee that

00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
exposed all kinds of things like
MKULTRA and CIA assassination

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.131 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They were viewed
as enemies of the CIA.

00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But all of
a sudden, 1980s,

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
it's fascinating
because now we have

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
the secret team of characters,
like Shackley, like Bush,

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:90%
who was an old CIA hand, right?

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And Secord
and others popping up

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:90%
as part of this new enterprise.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, they
appeared to pop up.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:90%
They had been going on.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I'm sorry,
not popping up.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They popped
into public view.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: They became
the establishment.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
They were the
establishment but they

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.760 align:middle line:84%
became the recognized
political infrastructure

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of the 1980s for this
new drug trade, which

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
now, is the expansion of the
cocaine traffic out of South

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, why was that
integral for them?

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.087 align:middle line:84%
Why do they need to expand into
this massive dumping of cocaine

00:17:56.087 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
into the streets of
the United States,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:84%
crack into the streets of
United States and whatnot?

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, what it
was, is they had already

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
developed this template
at the end of World War

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
II of smuggling the heroin in
through the course of the mafia

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
into Havana to help, in
that particular case, fund

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.164 align:middle line:90%
the Kuomintang.

00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what they were doing.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.337 align:middle line:84%
They were funding the
so-called Nationalist Chinese.

00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Against Mao.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Against Mao, right.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
they were doing then.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And that helps
establish Taiwan.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:90%
That was how they did it.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So they had that template
and what happens,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
when Shackley, who
knew all about,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
was assigned first, to be the
Deputy Station Chief in Laos,

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
he set up a special
program with Vang Pao

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.522 align:middle line:84%
to supplement that
entire flow of heroin

00:18:40.522 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
because it had been cut off
coming through Cuba, right?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So what he did, is he went
back in and reinstigated

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that entire operation with the
opium trafficking coming in

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and so he was doing all of that.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So when he ended up being put
in charge of the Miami station

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
before, he knew
enough how to do this.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And so what he was doing,
when he came back from Saigon,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
he got put in charge of all
Western Hemisphere operations.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So what he did is remove all
of the CIA Station Chiefs

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in the Western Hemisphere and
put in all of his own men.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Mexico City station
was critical to this operation

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America because it
was contiguous, basically,

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to the United States and they
could move guys in and out

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.304 align:middle line:84%
really easily out
of Mexico City.

00:19:23.304 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You can move-- you can
traffic drugs through there

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and also financing banks.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've seen
Mexico being taken over

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.836 align:middle line:90%
by the American banks.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Citibank is, if not the
biggest, one of the biggest

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:90%
banks in Mexico now.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So it
became a critical base

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:90%
for this operation.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And inside the Security Division
of the Mexican national oil

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
company called Pemex, there
was the security division,

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that housed the
assassination operations

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that the Central Intelligence
Agency was running off

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:90%
the books.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Now and Shackley was helping
to run that operation.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.104 align:middle line:84%
And the head of Pemex
was a man by the name

00:19:56.104 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of Jorge Diaz Serrano, who
was the former business

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
partner of George H. W. Bush
in the Zapata Oil Company.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole connection
was still going on there.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So Shackley-- if
you want to track

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
the kind of the entire history
from the end of World War

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
II, the whole rise of
this new major heroin

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
operation, the cocaine
operations going on,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
the political assassination
operations, and what happened

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is when Richard Nixon ended up
getting basically impeached,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
when the articles of impeachment
were ruled upon by the House

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Judiciary Committee,
and he ended up

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
backing out of the whole
thing and the Vietnam

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
War was being shut down.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
What happened is Shackley
viewed that as a betrayal

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because he had
become a dedicated

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
fascist and the dedicated
fascists use communism

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
as their antipode, their
dialectical opponent, OK?

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did,
is he helped set up,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War II,
he and Gehlen, out of Berlin,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
set up a special anti-communist
Special Warfare Training

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Academy in Bavaria,
up in Oberammergau.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And they train 1,200 men from
all of the national security

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
agencies of the Western
powers, including

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Israel at that place
from 1947 up to 1965.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They trained 1,200 men
and they filtered them out

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
into all the national
security bureaucracies of all

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
the Western powers
and these guys

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
were more loyal to
each other horizontally

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
than they were to their
own governments vertically.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:90%
And Shackley ran that operation.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So Shackley was in charge of
all these guys around the world.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Mike Harari that
was in the Mossad

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in Israel, all of these
people were run by Shackley.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
He's the domo.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
He is the major domo that ran
the field operations, heroin

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
smuggling, assassination
operations, covert operations.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.662 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that masterminded
mining the harbors in Nicaragua

00:21:58.662 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that got the Contras declared
to be international war

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
criminals by the International
Court of Justice.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all Shackley.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:90%
He's the man.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.816 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Sure, sure,
and obviously,

00:22:06.816 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that dialectic of-- how do you
say-- so-called democracies

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:84%
versus communism
was a great cover

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:90%
for the fascists at that time.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it's interesting
because you bring it to 9/11

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same infrastructure
of people around the 9/11

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:90%
event, it seems to me.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Bush's son,
Cheney, who was basically

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
part of the military industrial
congressional complex

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.467 align:middle line:84%
since his congressional
days, Rumsfeld,

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
going back to his relationship
to the corporations

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in the Nixon administration, and
then the neo-cons, who really

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
had people, Elliott
Abrams and Poindexter

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and others, who were part of
that enterprise, Iran-Contra

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.301 align:middle line:90%
scandal.

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:46.591 align:middle line:84%
They're all part of this
infrastructure of the new Bush

00:22:46.591 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.929 align:middle line:84%
And what comes to America,
it seems to me, is fascism.

00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That they basically
institutionalized

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.514 align:middle line:90%
this fascist agenda.

00:22:53.514 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit,
what is this Nazi ideology?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What is this fascist
agenda that they

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
have been working
so hard to create

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and basically they implemented
through the USA Patriot

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Act and homeland security
and these new concepts that

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
are completely foreign to, I
think, a patriotic American?

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The old school would
never imagine America

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:90%
being called the homeland.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, this was
a particular ideology that

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
was developed by Mussolini
in believing that--

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:90%
and it worked in Germany.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Is was that the way to have your
economy run most efficiently

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and effectively is to have the
instrumentalities of government

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
combine with the corporations,
these corporations that

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
are owned by
shareholders, capitalists,

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
but who are completely
immunized against any liability

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
for whatever the
corporation does.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And the management is
completely immunized,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the Board of Directors
are completely immunized.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Just the corporation
itself, like an entity,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
is liable for whatever
it is they do.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:84%
This is an entity that
was created actually

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
in the United States in
the immediate aftermath

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Civil War.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
From 1868 to 1872, there were a
whole series of court decisions

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that were made that actually
were the initial ruling

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:90%
that corporations were people.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
it was an actual set of
rulings that were made.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And people
are corporations

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.066 align:middle line:90%
according to that terminology.

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So the
bottom line is,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that this new institution,
this new business vehicle,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
if you will, was a transnational
corporate capitalist

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
corporation in that from 1868
to 1898, a short 30-year period,

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
this entire elite that owned
the stock in a major bunch

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.664 align:middle line:84%
of these corporations, the oil
corporations, the Rockefellers,

00:24:35.664 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
right, Standard
Oil of New Jersey,

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Standard Oil of California.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You had J.P. Morgan
Guaranty Trust.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
You had Rockefellers
with the Chase Manhattan

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Bank and the oil companies.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Irani, DuPont,
all of these guys.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They rose to a
position of the robber

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.865 align:middle line:84%
barons of this extraordinarily
elite power group.

00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is, they all became

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
private investment clients
of Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.734 align:middle line:84%
Brown Brothers Harriman was a
private investment corporation.

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
What they would do is, they
would all come together.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They would sit at
a table together

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and they would decide
what kind of investments

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
they were going to be
making collectively.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And they sat on
each other's Boards.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They had interlocking
directorates

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.774 align:middle line:84%
of these corporations,
et cetera.

00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
ended up taking

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:90%
over the entire government.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time of McKinley
coming to power in 1896,

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that they basically
were in complete charge.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Mark Hanna, who was his
Karl Rove-- he was the Karl

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Rove, basically, to McKinley--
and he was the basic guy

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:90%
running this whole operation.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they ended
up getting the United States

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:84%
military to go into
places like Nicaragua

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow the
democratic regime.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
They took over the
Hawaiian islands.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:90%
They took over Guam.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:90%
They took over all of this.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Secretary
of State at that

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
time, in 1893, actually,
was John W. Foster,

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:84%
who was the grandfather
of Allen Dulles.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:84%
John Foster Dulles
and Allen Dulles,

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
he was their grandfather.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
His son-in-law, Robert Lansing,
became the Secretary of State

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:84%
for Woodrow Wilson, who
drafted the Versailles Treaty

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:90%
negotiation.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
All of those people are
all one cabal of people.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And Allen Dulles became
the center point of this

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
because Allen Dulles was a young
lawyer in the firm of Sullivan

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and Cromwell, was legal counsel
to Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
His uncle, Robert Lansing,
brought him with him

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to Versailles and had Allen
Dulles and John Foster Dulles

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
draft up and insert into
the Treaty of Versailles

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
the reparations
requirements for Germany.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And then appointed Dulles to
be the lawyer for Germany.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And he negotiated
the contracts whereby

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the reparations that had
to be repaid by Germany

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
were done by getting loans from
the clients of Brown Brothers

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Harriman.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Loan the money to Germany.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And he was their lawyer.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's what rebuilt--

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And then they backed
Hitler's rise and made sure

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that basically his
militarization was all part

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:90%
of their scheme--

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To be the bulwark
against Bolshevism in Europe.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But given that
these people are now dead,

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:90%
who are their disciples?

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Who can we look at as the
heart of the modern fascist

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:90%
international?

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Shackley, the Blond
Ghost, has passed on

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and George H. W.
Bush is nearly dead,

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:90%
but how can we recognize this?

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
obviously, Cheney.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Cheney is a classic
manifestation

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.595 align:middle line:84%
of the fascist with
Halliburton and that wedding

00:27:34.595 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of the interest of the corporate
interests of Halliburton

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.880 align:middle line:84%
with the invasion
of the oil fields.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a group
called the Carlyle Group.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The Carlyle Group that
James Baker and the Bushes

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.202 align:middle line:90%
all put together.

00:27:46.202 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Frank Carlucci.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Frank
Carlucci are all in that.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
that we're trying

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to get the pipeline built
from the Caspian Sea

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
down through
Afghanistan and were

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
conducting the negotiations
with the Taliban.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
When the Taliban
refused to allow

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
them to move that oil
from the Caspian Sea

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
down to the Indian Ocean,
to the warm water port,

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.329 align:middle line:84%
that's when, in
fact, W. Bush decided

00:28:08.329 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
they were going to invade
them and overthrow him.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, were
told in advance

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.678 align:middle line:84%
that they'd be
bombed by that fall.

00:28:12.678 --> 00:28:15.289 align:middle line:84%
But that's interesting because
the drug traffic is huge now.

00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The heroin traffic out of
Afghanistan is massive.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to assume
that the overall Dope,

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Inc., that international drug
apparatus of CIA-linked banks

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:90%
and personnel must be involved.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:90%
In this explosion of heroin.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
Pakistani Bank, the bank

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
of international--
BCCI, that whole bank

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:90%
was set up in Pakistan.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: In the '80s.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The '80s,
that whole operation.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:84%
This thing is running
consistently like this.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who's sort of the
progeny of Theodore Shackley

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.310 align:middle line:84%
is a guy by the
name of Cofer Black.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Cofer Black was his deputy.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:90%
He was in the CIA.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
He was in the operations
directorate under Shackley.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that,
when 9/11 occurred,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:84%
he's the guy that
said, we're going

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to track down whoever
did this, pretending

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.364 align:middle line:84%
that it was the people
that they pretended did it.

00:29:07.364 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that
said to W. Bush,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%
he said, don't worry, boss.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:84%
There'll be flies on
their eyes by nightfall.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
guy this guy is.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And he is retired
in private practice

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
now he runs a thing called
Total Intelligence Solutions

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of Blackwater.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right and that would
seem to be part of the fascist

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
internationals,
was the idea of--

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Brown shirts.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Let's have-- exactly,
the black and brown shirts.

00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So the privatization
of the military.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's have the privatization
of prison systems,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:84%
potentially police
force in future,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
privatize our industries,
privatize our infrastructure.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.766 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think, really the
heart of the fascist ideology.

00:29:43.766 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It
becomes transparent

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
then because then what
they do is they privatize

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.700 align:middle line:84%
all these government
institutions and agencies

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:90%
and they set up corporations.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And now these corporations
can be hired privately.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean they've got
full battalions.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Blackwater's got
full battalions.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They have F-14 fighter
planes and tanks.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is absolutely
astonishing what's happening.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.762 align:middle line:84%
And they've endorsed all of this
under the Bush administration.

00:30:06.762 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: If you were
going to build a case

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.632 align:middle line:84%
and start with rectifying
us and getting away

00:30:10.632 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:84%
from this fascist
trajectory that's

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:84%
come about really
hardcore since 9/11,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.970 align:middle line:84%
How would you start to build a
case to basically bring justice

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:90%
for what occurred on 9/11?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: What we'll
do is reconstruct

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the big federal RICO
case, the Racketeering

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Influence and Corrupt
Organization Act,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
a federal statute
that exists, that we

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
used against the Enterprise when
we sued them in May of 1986.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We filed a major federal
RICO action against them.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what actually
forced Meese

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
to have to come
forward and plead

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.174 align:middle line:90%
to set up a special prosecutor.

00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they wanted to
take that away from us,

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that investigation away
from us, to shut that down.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So that they could, in fact,
control that investigation.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
ended up appointing

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
as the special prosecutor,
Lawrence Walsh, who

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:84%
was the senior partner
in the law firm

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that we kicked the crap out
of in the Karen Silkwood

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
case for $10 and 1/2 million and
we shut down the construction

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of all the private nuclear
plants in the country

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:84%
because we caught them
smuggling 98% pure bomb grade

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:84%
plutonium out of that facility
to Israel and to Iran.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: As part of
Israel's so-called

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
not having nuclear
weapons but they do.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:19.796 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:31:19.796 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
This is where they got them and
that was all under Shackley.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So the point is, they
put Lawrence Walsh in expecting

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.204 align:middle line:90%
that he would--

00:31:25.204 --> 00:31:27.269 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He would
be vengeful and try

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to attack us and destroy
us because we were

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the ones mounting the
major federal racketeering

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
lawsuit against them.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So they appointed Walsh
to be the special attorney

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.826 align:middle line:84%
and the irony of it is,
he knew we were right.

00:31:40.826 --> 00:31:42.200 align:middle line:84%
He knew we were
right in Silkwood

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because we just smothered those
guys with what we had found out

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and done.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he, in fact, I was
the very first interview

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.881 align:middle line:84%
they ever had when he was
put in as special prosecutor.

00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:52.472 align:middle line:90%
I just laid the whole thing out.

00:31:52.472 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I had been talking
to Danny Coulson

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:58.880 align:middle line:84%
through the FBI with
William Webster,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
at the specific
recommendation of Ross Perot.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Ross Perot
ran against Bush in 1992.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.870 align:middle line:84%
He was furious with Bush
because Bush was lying to him.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We were giving all this
information to Ross Perot.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:84%
He was on President Reagan's
National Security Advisory

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:15.815 align:middle line:84%
committee and we were feeding
him all this information

00:32:15.815 --> 00:32:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and he was furious about this.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:84%
He confronted George Bush and
Bush lied right to his face.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And so he ran against
him to stop him

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.971 align:middle line:90%
from having a second term.

00:32:23.971 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And Walsh's
investigation ultimately led

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:84%
to indictments of six
officials, who Bush pardoned.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But the point was that it was
important in making the point

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:90%
that yes, there was corruption.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was trying to, at least,
bring the truth to light.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.160 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't get the whole
picture, it got something out.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So you think the same thing
could be done with 9/11?

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yes.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I think that

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:84%
this is a racketeering
enterprise,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:84%
just like we put-- we actually
published the major affidavit

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that we put together laying out
the information against them.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It was called The Shadow
Government, right?

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
OK and it lays out, with
150-some footnotes, the details

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.790 align:middle line:84%
of the historical development
of this racketeering enterprise.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we pointed out
is that the activities

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Enterprise that
came to public knowledge

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
under the Reagan/Bush
administration

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
was just the most recent
venture of these people.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They'd been engaged in drug
smuggling and massive weapons

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.745 align:middle line:84%
transports, assassinations,
all the kinds of things that

00:33:19.745 --> 00:33:22.610 align:middle line:84%
are the classic, predicate acts
of the federal racketeering

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:23.674 align:middle line:90%
organization.

00:33:23.674 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And so we laid it out.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And so that's the way to get
this thing, is you construct

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.360 align:middle line:10%
a major RICO case
and you say, this

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:10%
is the same enterprise
that surfaced back then.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And the last point
that Lawrence Walsh

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
made when they shut him
down, after his indictment

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:84%
of these people and all the
pardons were given, he said,

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
if you don't stop
these people, he said,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
come to regret this.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to come back again

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:90%
to haunt you sooner than later.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And this time it won't be under
the rubric of anti-communism,

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.551 align:middle line:84%
it will be under the
rubric of anti-terrorism.

00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, and here we go.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.091 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's what he said.

00:33:56.091 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And here we go.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So are you
ready to do that,

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.344 align:middle line:90%
to pursue a case like that?

00:33:59.344 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Or what would it take?

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: I've been asked to.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:84%
The major architects
and engineers for 9/11

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Truth, I delivered the
keynote to them at Ground Zero

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.806 align:middle line:90%
this last year.

00:34:09.806 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time I've agreed
to do this because people have

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:13.940 align:middle line:84%
approached me in the
past and said, look it,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.606 align:middle line:84%
you got the kind of
operation that knows

00:34:15.606 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:90%
how to do these kind of things.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:90%
Would you be willing to do this?

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:21.864 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, you've got
to be serious about this.

00:34:21.864 --> 00:34:24.379 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have an
adequate set of funding.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
There are people around
that would be willing

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
if the proper approach
is made to fund this

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:36.120 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to have a war
chest of probably $10 million

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to put together because you've
got to hire investigators.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put
them in the field.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.239 align:middle line:90%
They've got to rent cars.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.739 align:middle line:90%
They've got to go to hotels.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've got to do
this major investigation.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
The Karen Silkwood case
cost us $6 million.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
We won $10 and 1/2
million in the judgment.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The Iran-Contra case cost
us eight million dollars,

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And we would have taken
them to the cleaners

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.620 align:middle line:84%
if Judge James Lawrence King,
who was the Chief Federal

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Judge in Miami, hadn't
been a member of the Board

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of Directors of Meyer Lansky's
National Bank of Miami,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and was appointed by Richard
Nixon at the recommendation

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:90%
of Bebe Rebozo.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
That was his friend,
another bag man.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So we ran right
into that buzzsaw

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:84%
coming into the Iran-Contra
case and so did Lawrence Walsh,

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I hope we can
get a real investigation

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:90%
into the truth on 9/11.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So I wish you luck
and I appreciate

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.280 align:middle line:84%
you coming on and
speaking with us today

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have to hopefully,
in the future, find out more

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.966 align:middle line:90%
as history reveals itself.

00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Sean.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.607 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Thank you, Danny.

00:35:37.607 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
There you have it,
folks, some great history

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
from Daniel Sheehan.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.994 align:middle line:84%
today but I urge
you to check out

00:35:43.994 --> 00:35:46.390 align:middle line:84%
his website,
danielpsheehan.com as well

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
as his book, "The People's
Advocate" for more details.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean Stone
and you are the revolution.
