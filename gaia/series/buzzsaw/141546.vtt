Let's enter the buzzsaw.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:18.585 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Ken Hanson.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Hanson is a dynamic
author, lecturer,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.037 align:middle line:10%
and founder of Treasures in
Time, an organization devoted

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:10%
to disseminating knowledge
of the biblical and classical

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:10%
world.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
He has dug on archaeological
sites in the Middle East,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
lived in a politically volatile
region of northern Galilee,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.645 align:middle line:84%
and taught Hebrew on an Israeli
agricultural settlement.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
He has also worked with a
television news gathering

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.152 align:middle line:84%
operation in a war zone
in southern Lebanon

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
at the height of
the civil war that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:84%
left the jewel of the
Mediterranean in ruins.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Today he cracks his whip
on some ancient knowledge.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. KEN HANSON:
Cracking the whip.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: There we go.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. HANSON: We need this in
the academic world from time

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:10%
to time.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Keep the students
in line, right?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, actually towards
that end my question

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is, why do you think we give
such historical onus to Israel?

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The fact is war is
still being fought.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Conflict still exists
over Israel's existence,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and yet the Hebrews
obviously drive so much

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
of their teaching, so much of--
their Bible actually derived

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
from Sumerian traditions and
history, Egyptian teachings

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So what is it about Israel
that is so important,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
do you think, for us today?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well,
we scholars are always

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
looking at the roots
of the biblical text,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and you're absolutely right.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It seems that a
lot of the stories

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and the quote unquote
"mythology" of the Bible

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
does derive from
ancient Sumerian,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Mesopotamian sources,
even Egyptian sources.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when you think
about those ancient cultures,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:90%
what did they give us?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Sumerians,
Mesopotamians

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
gave us great towers
reaching to the skies.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Ziggurats, they were called.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the tradition
behind the Tower of Babel.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians gave us, of
course, the great pyramids

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and the magnificent temples
at Karnak and elsewhere.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
What did the Israelites give us?

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
An idea.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Just an idea that was and
remains as revolutionary

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:90%
as the wheel--

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
namely that there is only
one power in the universe.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And that very idea, especially
when you take it back thousands

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of years, set us
free from, , what,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
the whims of the gods and
goddesses who were always

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
squabbling with each other?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
The idea that Marduk
may be mad, so he

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
might send a flood tomorrow
and whisk us all away.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
People lived literally
in fear of nature.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The gods were
personifications of nature,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
amazing inventions

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Mesopotamians
was the first alcoholic beverage

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:90%
on Earth-- barley beer.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And those texts tell us
they drank a lot of it,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
because they never knew what
was coming down the pike.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
They felt helpless, like
some strange fate is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:90%
going to determine our future.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, with this idea of a single
god-- that's monotheism--

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%
a single power--

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:84%
for better or for
worse, there's meaning.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
There's purpose in
everything that happens,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and there's the birth of a
word that one author called

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:84%
by itself a Jewish word,
and that word is progress.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
From generation to
generation, we actually

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
are charged and tasked
with making the world

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:90%
a better place.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked a rabbi,
when will the messiah come?

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And the rabbi asked
when we make the world

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
worthy to receive him.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:90%
What a powerful concept.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Israelites gave us.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right, precisely.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.235 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously there
is this issue of mythology,

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
as you talked about,
within the Bible itself.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, Israeli scholars like
Finkelstein and Silberman

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.176 align:middle line:84%
have pointed out, and
they've questioned

00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
the validity of the historical
nature of the Bible.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
They've written
"Bible Unearthed,"

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying, look,
they're essentially--

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:90%
people don't know the history.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't remember that
Judah was one kingdom

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and everyone says Jewish,
but Judah was one kingdom,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.947 align:middle line:90%
and Israel was another one.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And basically when
Israel disappeared,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
the 10 tribes disappeared with
them, and yet their argument--

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Finkelstein and
Silberman's argument

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is that essentially there
never was this unified

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful kingdom that the
Bible may have portrayed

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
after the fact when they
were trying-- basically

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.532 align:middle line:84%
when the scholars were
trying to give onus

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
to this idea of having been
conquered-- that they will come

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:90%
back one day.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It's always this
return mythology

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.987 align:middle line:90%
within Israeli history.

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:32.570 align:middle line:84%
History is always
this notion of we're

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
going to return to
the promised land.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: We're
going to return.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.671 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's never really ours,
but we are always struggling.

00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:40.206 align:middle line:84%
We're always being oppressed,
or imprisoned, captured,

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
but we're always
going to return.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So what do you make, then,
of the real history of Israel

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
vis a vis the real
Israeli history

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.729 align:middle line:90%
versus the Biblical history?

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well,
actually the book

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned, "The Bible
Unearthed," is one of the texts

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that I use in a course I teach
at the University of Central

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Florida, the Judaic
studies program,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:90%
on biblical archeology.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm well familiar with
it, and I can also

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
tell you there are some
real flaws in that approach,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and that approach actually
is losing adherents

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
as time goes on
because wouldn't you

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
know the archeology
more and more

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.820 align:middle line:84%
seems to be sustaining
the biblical account.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Be careful before you
decide that the Bible is

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:90%
guilty until proven innocent.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Some of the recent
archeology, for example,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
focuses on, among
other things, a town

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
quite a distance
from Jerusalem called

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Khirbet Qeiyafa, which was on
the border of ancient Israel

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and ancient Philistia quite
a distance from Jerusalem.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, new archeology
has shown massive walls

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.600 align:middle line:90%
at that town.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It also has unearthed the
earliest examples of Hebrew

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
writing ever discovered,
writing apparently composed

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
by a formal scribe, who
had to have been sent

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:90%
from a centralized government.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't have walls like that.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't have scribes coming
from a central government

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:90%
when you have no kingdom.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
There had to have
been-- in fact,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
just as the Bible records--

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
a strong and in fact
unified kingdom.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
We even have an inscription
way up to the north--

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I used to live in
northern Galilee

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
not far from an archaeological
site called Tel Dan.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And this elderly
Israeli archaeologist

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
was for years doing excavations
at that site, when one summer

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
somebody shouts, I
found something here.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I found something.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:90%
He said, what is it?

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.361 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And plain as day
in ancient Hebrew

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
there is reference to the
Hebrew words Melech Israel,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
King of Israel, and
right underneath it

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Hebrew script it says
beit David, the house of David.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's it doing way
up north if there never

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:90%
was a centralized kingdom?

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And even beyond
that, as we speak,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
archaeological excavations are
continuing in Jerusalem itself,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
the City of David, and there
is good reason to believe--

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm now quoting Israeli
archaeologist Eilat Mazar

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that they have in fact uncovered
the foundations of the palace

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:90%
of King David himself.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I've been to that site.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
careful, again,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and I think that the biblical
account really holds water

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.169 align:middle line:90%
on so many different levels.

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean it's perfect.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.384 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure, sure.

00:07:35.384 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
What do you think--
well, speaking

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of which this notion of Hebrews
being slaves within Egypt

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.987 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of Moses parting
the Red Sea to flee them,

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
the relationship was

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
between this kingdom
of Israel and Egypt?

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that it was
basically essentially

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:90%
a neighboring kingdom?

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Was it a vassal state?

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that Moses--

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
what I'm asking
essentially was Moses part

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps a pharaoh
or the pharaonic family

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that basically relocated
certain people north

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
to establish this new king?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.786 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well, there's
all kinds of controversy

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
about the biblical
exodus, as well,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and for generations,
in fact, the Bible

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
has lost a lot of credibility
because it's very difficult

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to find any archeology to
substantiate that Israelites

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
were ever in Egypt to begin
with, much less that they made

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
a great exodus, or
that a generation later

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
under a conqueror named Joshua
they came into this promised

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.402 align:middle line:90%
land and took it.

00:08:33.402 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Where's the evidence of this?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence of a few
cities destroyed here and there

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:90%
like Hazor in northern Galilee.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Terrific destruction.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Incredible fire, but if you're
looking at the same period

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
in time, you're looking for a
city like Jericho that should

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed about
the same time, and it wasn't.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Its destruction, if
it were destroyed,

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
had to have been much earlier,
even a couple of centuries

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:90%
So there's holes all through it.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, however, there's
some suggestion

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we've been looking at
the wrong time period entirely.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we should be looking a
couple of centuries earlier,

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and we find all manner of
circumstantial evidence.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:90%
We can't prove anything.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
It would be very difficult,
say, 1,000 years from now

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to prove that George Washington
ever lived or existed,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
but if there had not been Moses,
we would have to invent one.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
favorite little pieces

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
of the evidence of
the puzzle is the Ark

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant, the
famous Ark of the Covenant.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.122 align:middle line:90%
What became of it?

00:09:36.122 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, Indiana Jones
had a certain perspective

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:90%
on what it was.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Well, sure.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:39.935 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:39.935 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Would you believe
it was like that energy

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.478 align:middle line:84%
weapon, that scene in that
film, "Raiders of the Lost Ark?"

00:09:44.478 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: What I
think it was basically

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian chest,
and none other than

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
famed Israeli archaeologist
from the Hebrew University

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem came to my
university, UCF Orlando,

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Florida, and talked
about that very fact

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that we have a chest
described by the Bible

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
in a way that makes it look
uncannily similar, almost

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
identical to the type
of Egyptian gold covered

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
chests found in the
archeology of Egypt.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
King Tut's tomb, for example--
we have this amazing gold

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:90%
covered chest with--

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.939 align:middle line:84%
and you have winged beings,
the goddess Isis on top.

00:10:26.939 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, for the
Israelites, they replaced this

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:84%
with golden cherubs, but
if the biblical minimalists

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
are correct who basically find
the Bible guilty until proven

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
innocent, who says it's all
just a fantasy and all contrived

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
later, OK, let's enter into
the marketplace of ideas

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and then put you on the spot.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
How do you suppose, if this
text were composed centuries

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
after the fact--

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:84%
maybe even in the
Israelite exile centuries

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
later in Babylonia, which
is what some of them

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:90%
actually argue--

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
how would people
that far removed

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
know what an Egyptian
chest would look like?

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:84%
That the Hebrews
would have created

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
an ark that looked like
something in their own culture

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
like a chest from
King Tut's tomb.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:84%
If I were creating a
story about ancient China

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
a couple of millennia ago,
I wouldn't have a clue

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:90%
how to write it.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably have
somebody in a Ford Focus

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.069 align:middle line:90%
or something driving around.

00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But what would be
inside that chest then?

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Ah,
basically the Ark

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant
from my perspective

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
is what we call a covenant box.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Just a box that symbolizes
the single most important word

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:90%
in all of Hebrew tradition.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Berith in Hebrew, a covenant.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a contract, and
it contained the two tablets

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:90%
of the 10 commandments.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the ark
has never been found.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows if it
even exists anymore.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, we've heard
legends and rumors about it

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:90%
existing in Ethiopia, I think--

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: In Ethiopia.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --that was reported
they have it there.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Right, there is an
old text that talks about King

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Menelik I from Ethiopia
who was supposedly

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
the son of King Solomon and the
Queen of Sheba, who brought it

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:90%
down to Ethiopia.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Only trouble is
people normally assume

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%
that Sheba is really Ethiopian.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.386 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Indonesia or Shiva,
or it could be from the East.

00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: From
the biblical texts--

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm a textual scholar--

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
all it says is that she
was queen of the south.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Hebrew, the word south
is also the word for right

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
way that maps were

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
situated in the ancient times.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
East was actually the
upper part of the map.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So if south would
be the right side--

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew word for right is yameen.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to another
word, Teiman, which is Yemen.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you go due south from
the land of Israel today,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:90%
you'll end up in Yemen.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And that was
the Israeli king--

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: We got the wrong--

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the queen of Sheba
was from Yemen.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, not Ethiopia.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But the last Jewish
kingdom was in Yemen, correct?

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Yes, and
there were Yemenite Jews

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:84%
who existed there for centuries
who were not brought out,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.352 align:middle line:84%
in fact, until the great
airlift soon after the creation

00:13:00.352 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of the state of Israel.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:90%
It is an incredible story.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, bottom line is
the whole Menelik account

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't put much stock in.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They say it's in a church
somewhere in Ethiopia.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll believe it when I see it.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.383 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, getting into this
issue of last kingdom in Yemen

00:13:13.383 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and obviously the
Jewish influence

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.615 align:middle line:84%
across the Arab
peninsula, people

00:13:16.615 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that Islam
actually derives so much

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.859 align:middle line:90%
of its tradition from Judaism.

00:13:20.859 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Absolutely.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So I'm interested,
because you've talked about

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:90%
kabbalah before--

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this notion
that kabbalah actually

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
refers to the Kaaba, which
is the house of Abram, right?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Before it becomes Abraham--

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.455 align:middle line:90%
and allah.

00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:35.689 align:middle line:90%
Kaaba allah-- kabbalah.

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Isn't
that interesting?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that curious?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, etymologically
I can tell you

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that that kabbalah, as we
pronounce it over in Israel,

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
comes from a verbal root,
qabal, which means to receive.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, it means that
which is received if we just

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
look at the etymology
of the word,

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about a
whole group of Jewish mystics

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
who received things from
another dimension from on high,

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:90%
as it were--

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:90%
remarkable revelations.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the flowering of
kabbalah is actually

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
from the medieval
period, and that's

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
when we find the word
itself sprouting.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really talk about
kabbalah as a word before that,

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.075 align:middle line:84%
but there are traces of
it going way, way back.

00:14:22.075 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They were just called
different things.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It was called, for example,
Merkabah, mysticism,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
which means chariot, going
back to Ezekiel's vision,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
where he sees the chariot, and
the wheels covered with eyes.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are traces of
this going way, way back.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:90%
What about Islam?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:90%
What about the Kaaba?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just
coincidence, but mystically,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:90%
if you want to find--

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I say if you want to find
the common golden thread

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
through all religions don't
look at their doctrines.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at their ideologies,
because the religions

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
of the world, let me tell you--
why we had so many religious

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:90%
wars--

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, they're
designed to conflict

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier to
control people that way.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: There you go.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:90%
War after war.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder people are
turned off by religion.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Of course.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: It is
their doggone doctrines

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and ideologies, but if you
want to find the common thread,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
mystical tradition,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's not a religion on
Earth that doesn't have one.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.434 align:middle line:84%
And they're all remarkably
going the same direction,

00:15:15.434 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
saying much the same thing
that there are other dimensions

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
get in touch with.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, could kaaba allah have
something on a mystical level

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:90%
to do with it?

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.084 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:15:27.084 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
etymology there.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:90%
We're talking mysticism itself.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
interesting link,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and that is in Jewish
tradition there's

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.595 align:middle line:90%
a little box called tefillin.

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
two of them that

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
contain little parchments
that say in Hebrew,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.390 align:middle line:84%
here oh, Israel, the
Lord God has won.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
One box is placed
on the forehead,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
the other on the left forearm.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And that little box--

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it
closely, if you

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:84%
look at a photo of one
of these tefillin boxes--

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:90%
it's a little black box.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you line that up with
a photo of the Kaaba in Mecca,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the
same thing precisely.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are leather
straps attached

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to that box that are wrapped
around the left forearm

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
seven times because
there are seven heavens,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and there are seven levels
of the evil inclination

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
in every one of us that we
need to overcome every day.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the Hajj in
Mecca, how many times

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
do people march
around the Kaaba?

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Seven.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Seven times.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And then even in
the Buddhist traditions

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the seven
heavens and seven hells,

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and many of the
eastern traditions talk

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:90%
about this, too.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.366 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Exactly.

00:16:37.366 --> 00:16:39.599 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
going on mystically in all

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:90%
the religions, I believe.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
mystical tradition,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:84%
obviously Christianity
has it, as well.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Talmudic version
of Jesus is Yeshu,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and they refer to a Yeshu
Ben Pandera, for example.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And it said that he
learned his abilities--

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
he became a magician
essentially in that tradition.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.615 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's able to do these
things like resurrect the dead

00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and walk on water, and it
was because that version

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
is that he went to
Egypt and basically got

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
the secrets from the temple
and basically the various old--

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
the priests there
had taught him magic.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
What do you make
of that in regards

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
to you've spoken
about Jesus basically

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.880 align:middle line:90%
teaching kabbalistic secrets?

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Yeah, there are
some very early references

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:90%
in Jewish writings.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
The Talmud, as you mentioned,
the voluminous encyclopedia

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish wit, and
wisdom, and law--

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and there are faint
and scant references

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
to Yeshu, which is the
way Jews refer to Jesus.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeshua was his name, but
it's shortened to Yeshu.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are
references to someone

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
named Yeshua Ben Pandera
or Pantera having taught

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
certain things that
were not to be accepted,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and one rabbi, Eliezer Ben
Hurcanus got in real trouble.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
He was actually
arrested because he

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
was listening to some of this
secret talk and secret wisdom

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:90%
from this Yeshu Ben Pantera.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It was passed down through
one of his disciples.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And another disciple named in
the Talmud is someone, Jacob--

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
apparently was trying to heal
someone of a snake bite--

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
another rabbi also named
Eliezer from a snake bite

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in the name of
Yeshu Ben Pantera.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And scholars think that
this individual probably

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, Jesus of
Nazareth that the Talmud is

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:90%
referring to.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, who Pantera
was-- now that's

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
an issue for probably a whole
other show because there's

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:90%
a lot that goes into that.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Who was, in fact,
the father of Jesus?

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Some claimed he was
a Roman soldier.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
other can of worms,

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
but the bottom
line is that there

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
are ancient traditions about
Jesus, the historical Jesus,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that he had certain powers--

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.704 align:middle line:84%
magical powers, if you
were, mystical powers.

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Through the
centuries, people have

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
tried to divorce Jesus
from his miracles.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Thomas Jefferson tried that.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.457 align:middle line:90%
Albert Schweitzer try that.

00:19:06.457 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You want to find the
historical Jesus?

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Just get rid of
all the miracles.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.426 align:middle line:90%
You get rid of the miracles.

00:19:11.426 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:84%
You get rid of the
healings, and you

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:90%
don't have historical Jesus.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.132 align:middle line:90%
That's how intertwined they are.

00:19:17.132 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But there are
mystical traditions

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
of these types of healings,
these types of miracles

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
from around the world,
and oftentimes Christians

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.783 align:middle line:84%
won't accept it because
that would challenge

00:19:24.783 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
their notion of God and man,
but we know from mystical--

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
from people who've
experienced mysticism

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:90%
that these things occur.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it is about,
for example, the Kabbalah,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
just to explain to people
what the mystical teachings

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Kabbalah,
for example, could

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
help us understand-- how we can
understand the world better?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.931 align:middle line:84%
You talked about the different
dimensions and the seven

00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
dimensions of heaven
and hell, for example,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
but in a deeper
profound sense, what

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.872 align:middle line:84%
do you make of the Kabbalah
and its wisdom for us?

00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well,
you can sit in church

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
pews for your entire life or
in many synagogues, I'm afraid,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
for your entire life and
not learn much about real

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves people, frankly,
turned off and searching

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
for something,
anything that would

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:90%
lend a new dimension to life.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Are we more than just flesh,
and blood, and blood cells,

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and corpuscles, and
all those things?

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And looking for something--
and it's right in our backyard.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
These traditions are hidden
right in the biblical text

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and beyond in Kabbalah,
and the basic teachings

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
has to do with how
we can find balance--

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:90%
balance in all things.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense of
compassion in the world,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
but it's balanced by other
attributes of severity

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
understand and recognize.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
People find things are
not going well for them.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:90%
They get upset.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.906 align:middle line:84%
They shake their fist
at the great void.

00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why me.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Well, justice is severe.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It can go both ways.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Justice is
severe, and the teachings

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:90%
are so profound.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We all find ourselves
in positions

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of being judged at some point.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a professor.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm a judge every
day, and we have

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
mete out compassion,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
but it takes strong
character, also,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to hold the position and
the authority of judge,

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, the
severity of judge.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
If I'm too pushy on my students,
I'm not doing them a service.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
If we experience
pain, for example,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
this is perhaps the perennial
problem of human existence--

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
the problem of pain.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
There are various
divine emanations

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
according to Kabbalah
through which God interacts

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
with the material
world, and one of them

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:84%
has to do, in fact,
with weakness.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
emanation of Hod.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It means the divine
splendor that

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
makes us weak in its presence.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
This is actually divine
and very powerful.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
There were rabbis suffering
through the Holocaust,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
in fact, who left
behind spiritual diaries

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of Kabbalah
trying to understand

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the emanations
aren't getting through,

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
but in spite of all of
that, in spite of everything

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:90%
we suffered, they wrote--

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.757 align:middle line:84%
and these diaries
have just recently

00:22:15.757 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
come to light in the
last couple of decades.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
They wrote we must
never lose hope,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
because hopelessness is the
same as giving up on ourselves,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
giving up on the divine.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It's negating the divine,
basically saying--

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON:
Negating the divine.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: --I don't believe.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't trust in God's plan
anymore, and I'm losing faith.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: And in
spite of everything,

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
we will go on believing, and
that was their conclusion.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.736 align:middle line:90%
Very profound.

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, and certainly
as a result now we have Israel

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
in a certain sense has
been reconstituted,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and as we talked about before,
there's a lot of conflict

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that's coming out of it,
but also do you think

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:84%
there's a chance for peace that
can come from a realization

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:90%
of these three religions--

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity,
Islam-- all derived

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
from the same founders,
fathers, teachings essentially,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and they have slight differences
in their interpretations,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, but at the end
the day, the same source.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that Israel
can ultimately be a unifier,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
rather than as it currently
stands, I think, as a divider

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:90%
in the region?

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well, there's
some great prophecies from

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Hebrew scriptures--
the most famous, perhaps,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
from the book of
the prophet Isaiah--

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
everybody's heard of him--

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in the second
chapter, which relates

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:84%
a vision of the end of
days that says come and let

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:90%
us go up to the house of God.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Torah, which
literally means the teaching.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Pentateuch, or
the books of Moses, or the law.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a horrible translation.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the teaching.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, like
Islam, it's a pathway.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Judaism and Islam, by
the way-- maybe people

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:84%
don't know this-- are closer
to each other than Judaism

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to Christianity, because they're
both looking for this pathway.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It says [HEBREW], from Zion
shall go forth the teaching.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:90%
[HEBREW]

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And the word of God of
Hashem from Jerusalem.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a vision of world peace,
and all nations will come up.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is just remarkable.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
On the very exterior of the
United Nations headquarters

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
in New York is carved
into stone a passage

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.525 align:middle line:84%
from the biblical prophet
who declares [HEBREW].

00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Nation shall not lift
up sword against nation.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:90%
[HEBREW]

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And they shall no
more learn war.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the vision of the
prophets, and yet how ironic

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
that the very
existence of Israel

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.525 align:middle line:90%
today should be a flashpoint--

00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.276 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: --of geopolitics.

00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's well--
and who knows

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
where this is going to take
us in terms of the end times

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
scenario, but one
thing that's actually

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.931 align:middle line:84%
quite interesting to me,
as well as the notion of

00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
within freemasonry they say that
the actual goal of Freemasonry

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is to reconstitute
Solomon's temple.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And the temple was
reconstructed once.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.644 align:middle line:84%
It was destroyed by
the Romans in 70 AD.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
A, do you think that there is
a possibility of this temple

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:90%
being reconstructed, or is it--

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.969 align:middle line:84%
physically, or do you think
it's more of a symbolic journey?

00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:20.997 align:middle line:84%
And what does it mean
to the Jewish people?

00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well,
there's even controversy

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
among archaeologists as to
where the ancient temple stood,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.535 align:middle line:84%
because not one
stone of it remains.

00:25:29.535 --> 00:25:30.945 align:middle line:90%
We've got the pyramids of Egypt.

00:25:30.945 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:90%
We've got the temple.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We've got the ziggurats
even, ancient Babylon.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Where are the Jewish monuments?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing remains.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So some-- I'm not even
sure where it was.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:84%
There's the Temple Mount
in the heart of Jerusalem.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous platform.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the
largest platform--

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
human made platform on
the face of the Earth.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
That even dwarfs the
pyramids, by the way,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
but there's an
Islamic shrine sitting

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
right there called the Dome of
the Rock, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Al-Aqsa means the
farthest mosque.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And adjacent to it, which is
actually the third holiest site

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:90%
in Islam, as you well know--

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:90%
the Dome of the Rock.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced that the rock
on which that dome stands

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, the location
not only of the temple,

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:84%
but if you are able to go
inside and visit inside,

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:84%
there are grooves in
that rock that I--

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.166 align:middle line:84%
as I first went to Israel
as a young student,

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and I stared at
it, I didn't know

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:84%
what those grooves are,
but only years later did

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.730 align:middle line:84%
an interesting article come
out in "Biblical Archeology

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Review" that shows that
the measurements of those

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
indentations in the rock
itself are exactly those

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Ark of the covenant.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Wow.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.199 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: That's
where it stood.

00:26:46.199 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you build
a new temple and not

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:90%
touch the Dome of the Rock?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That is certainly a
prescription for World War III.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't want to go there.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.588 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Or unification of all
three, because the rock could

00:26:58.588 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
also be the metaphor of
when Jesus told Peter

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
that you are the rock upon
which my church will be founded.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that's the rock,
and the dome covers it,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.465 align:middle line:90%
and the temple is within.

00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It can actually be a perfect
place for unification.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. HANSON: Well, that's
an interesting angle, yeah.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course I'm
all for unification.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem is such
an amazing city.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Having lived there
myself and studied there,

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
all within walking
distance you've

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
got the holiest site in
Judaism, the Western Wall.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Dome
of the Rock for Islam,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the Church
of the Holy Sepulcher, which

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced is, in fact,
archaeologically the site

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:90%
of the crucifixion of Jesus--

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:90%
all within walking distance.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:90%
What potential in this city.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
spending evenings just

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
walking through these
areas saying to myself,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be nice if we
could all just get along?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't it be nice?

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
another temple built,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to be honest--
another Jewish temple

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:84%
not touching or
harming at all, but I

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:84%
think Judaism needs
a spiritual center.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:10%
How do you think that ultimately
the work that you're doing--

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.966 align:middle line:10%
the historical
work you're doing--

00:28:02.966 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:10%
obviously we know that history
helps us better understand

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.631 align:middle line:10%
the world we're, but how do
you think that it's helping

00:28:07.631 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:10%
to understand ultimately
the goal of peace

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.847 align:middle line:10%
rather than conflict?

00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Because many people,
again, look at religion

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:90%
as a divisive thing.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that your
work is actually helping?

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe the
research in the Kabbalism

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and this mystical
tradition you spoke of.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:90%
How do you think that--

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:84%
you're doing work to
help people understand

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.285 align:middle line:84%
the mystical traditions so
they don't get caught up

00:28:28.285 --> 00:28:30.215 align:middle line:84%
in the letter of the
law, and they get in tune

00:28:30.215 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:90%
with the spirit of the law.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. HANSON: It's
so important, and I

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:10%
deal with these kind
of issues all the time.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I am a
professor, and I

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:10%
think that from my perspective
I ask myself, what can I do?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I'm a teacher.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I teach, and this education
is ultimately, I think,

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
where it needs to
start across the board.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We have classes
in Judaic studies.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm the director of
Judaic studies at UCF,

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
but we are an
interdisciplinary program,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you
more of our students

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:90%
are non-Jews than Jews.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a course called
Judaism and Jesus that's

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
going on right now, in fact.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It's all online, by the way, and
we're producing amazing videos

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
incidentally--

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:84%
like they're all
mini documentaries

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that we've never been able to
do before in an online course.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And students are
just totally into it.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:84%
We've got Christian
students who are into this.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I've had Muslim
students in my courses,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling
you, over the years,

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:84%
they have been some of the
best students I have ever had.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't always
agree, of course.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
We often disagree, but in terms
of the attitude and the sense

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to find real
common understanding--

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
somebody asked
[INAUDIBLE] what's

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:84%
the best Islamic
country in the world?

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said without
question, the United States.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
template that I think

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
we need to create really for
the world and B'ezrat HaShem

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and with God's help for
the Middle East, as well.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the other part
of what I do is in public.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I write, and, of
course, I'm out there.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to you now.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:90%
This helps move the ball along.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You have so
much wisdom to impart,

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and I would love to
get you back on again,

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
obviously, soon, because
it's a real pleasure speaking

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:90%
We could go on for hours.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Absolutely.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But I think we're
going to be seeing what

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:84%
happens in the Middle East
in the coming year I think

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:84%
it could be very interesting
with the new administration

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll have to
keep our eyes open--

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Definitely.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: --and speak
further at that point.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: Critical times.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.163 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah, thank you so much.

00:30:33.163 --> 00:30:34.849 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Jerusalem Jones.

00:30:34.849 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. HANSON: A pleasure.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.420 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure, Sean.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.753 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And there you go, folks.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:39.045 align:middle line:90%
Great insights from Ken Hanson.

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:41.294 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:30:41.294 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge you to
check out his web site,

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:10%
treasuresintime.org.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.529 align:middle line:10%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:30:47.529 --> 00:30:48.570 align:middle line:10%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It requires constant
reassessment.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:02.699 align:middle line:90%
