00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.784 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:10%
Tricia Twyman is
joining me today.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
She's a non-fiction writer on
esoteric history, mythology,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.156 align:middle line:10%
occultism, and other odd topics.

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
Her most well-known books
include "Clock Shavings,"

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:10%
"The Merovingian Mythos,"
"Solomon's Treasure,"

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:10%
and "Money Grows on
the Tree of Knowledge."

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:10%
Her latest book is "Baphomet,
the Temple Mystery Unveiled,"

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:10%
co-written with Alexander
Rivera of the theaeoneye.com.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Twyman has appeared on several
radio shows, television shows,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
documentaries, and
today she joins

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
me to discuss the esoteric
imprints of the Knights Templar

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:90%
from the past to the present.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by talking
about these Knights Templar.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.681 align:middle line:90%
Many people have heard of them.

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
We know that in the 14th century
that they were persecuted

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:90%
all across the Catholic world.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
But why were they persecuted?

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:10%
>>TRACY TWYMAN: Well, it
had to do with accusations

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:10%
of heresy and
blasphemous rituals

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:10%
that they were
accused of performing.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So of course, it was a
order of crusading knights

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:90%
chartered by the church.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, if this
information came out,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:90%
it was bad.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It all came from a person who
had been a member of the order

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%
and got kicked out.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he went to actually
the King of France

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and told him-- well, it wasn't
him necessarily, but someone

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in his administration--
and told him these facts,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
or what he alleged
had occurred when he

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:90%
was a member of the Templars.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
He said that they had a
blasphemous initiation

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
ritual that involved denying
Christ, spitting on the cross,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and then engaging in
bizarre sexual behaviors.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So during initiation,
supposedly you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would have to kiss the
behind of another Templar

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%
while you were there.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And then he actually also said
that they would take oaths

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to instead of having
sex with women,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
they would have sex
with each other.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:90%
That was somehow purer.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
even worse accusations

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
as well that sometimes
they did have

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:90%
sex with female prostitutes.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But when they did that,
they would actually

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
either abort and kill the
fetus, or let the baby be born

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:90%
and kill it also.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
All of these really
nasty things--

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
so basically, they were
accused of witchcraft.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And the King of France
put them on trial.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.242 align:middle line:84%
And they were tortured into
confessing all of these things.

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing,
though, is a lot

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of the confessions
were really consistent.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't necessarily
because of the torture

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that they were saying
what they were saying.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the Pope also
interrogated them.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
They confessed the same
things to him without torture.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they were actually

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
executed by the
French government.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.217 align:middle line:90%
So it was--

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: ---First get it
across the Catholic realm.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It was also on the wave
to Spain, I believe.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And they ultimately, some of
them, apparently found exile.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And they say they found asylum
in Scotland, for example.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.927 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
persecution beyond France.

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, the French King
actually-- not just him,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
but several kings
before him, too.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
France had had a great
deal of influence

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:90%
on the papacy at the time.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
seat of the papacy

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:90%
had been moved to France.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So they were really in
control of the pope.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And they made him
disband the order

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and have all of these knights
arrested all over Europe.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So it was across
the Christian world,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:90%
these knights were arrested.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And not all of them were killed.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that they
all got burnt at the stake,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
but only a few of them did.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.506 align:middle line:90%
But the leader did.

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Jacques de Molay got
executed and several

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:90%
of the other leaders.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest just--
they had to do penance.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
even joined some

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:90%
of the other knightly orders.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's the story
in history where

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks of it as
this wrongful, like you said,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
persecution.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.287 align:middle line:84%
So it's been fashionable
for a long time

00:04:54.287 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to think that they weren't
guilty of these things.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But I found some evidence
that actually they were.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that necessarily they

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.769 align:middle line:90%
were false accusations.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:06.143 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they should
have been burned at the stake.

00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What would
the evidence be

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.726 align:middle line:84%
that you would say that you
think that they actually

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:90%
were guilty of these heresies?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: Well, we have a
600-page book really all about

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
But just one of the
most striking examples

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is that in 2001, someone
working for the Vatican--

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
her name was Barbara Frale--
she found a document that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
dated from those times.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It was in the Vatican archives.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And it is the records
of this trial.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I said that the pope gave them
also the second trial, which

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
nobody knew about until then.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is new information.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, they weren't
tortured by the pope's people

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
when they were interrogated.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.754 align:middle line:84%
So again, there's no
real reason to think

00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:90%
that they were making it up.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
They confessed the same things.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.349 align:middle line:84%
They confessed not as
much the ritual sacrifice.

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They didn't deal with that
topic for some reason.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But they did confess
to the homosexual acts.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They admitted that it was
part of their initiation

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:90%
and their oath when they joined.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, they would vow
to not have sex with women

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and specifically, to not deny
their brothers sexual advances

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
if they were
presented with them.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like they were
guilty of those things they

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:90%
confessed.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:90%
Here's the interesting thing.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican put this
information out.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
This woman found the
document in 2001.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2007, they started
talking about it publicly.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
In 2011, she put
out a book about it.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And there were press
releases about it.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
This was a big event for the
Vatican to announce this thing.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Now they presented it as though
the Templars had been absolved.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.865 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the
headline in newspapers.

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And not just
absolved, but innocent

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
is what is being described as.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The pope found them
to be innocent.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you read newspaper
articles about this,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
they don't mention really
what they confessed to.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's been presented as though
the Templars were never guilty.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And what the Vatican
was trying to do

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
was put the blame for the whole
thing on the King of France

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and say their man,
the pope at the time,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.606 align:middle line:84%
was just manipulated
into doing this.

00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think also
they just wanted

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to make themselves look good,
because these were their guys.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
They chartered the Templar.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's always been a
mark on their history

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
that they fostered and
allowed these people

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to be at the forefront
of the Crusades

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
for 200 years with all
this stuff going on.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.605 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the truth
is that that's not

00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:90%
what happened at all.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
They weren't innocent.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:90%
They confessed.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were
absolved by the pope.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
They were forgiven, not as
though they were guilty.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just, say some Hail
Marys and you're forgiven.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.442 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't take away
at all from the truth

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:90%
of what they confessed.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So now one of the major
confessions and breakthroughs

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that most people,
I think, prefer

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.943 align:middle line:84%
to think about when it
comes to the Templars

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
is this worship of
something called Baphomet.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:10%
And Baphomet has been
portrayed by Eliphas Levi

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:10%
as this goat-headed, half human,
half goat with reptilian skin.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:90%
And what is this thing?

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
If people think it's a demon--
but what does your research

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:90%
tell you about Baphomet?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: Well, so Baphomet--
just to fit him into the story

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
here, this is this demon
that they were accused

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of worshipping during
these blasphemous rituals.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's one of
the most consistent things

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to come out of all
of their confessions.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
In the confessions, they're
describing it as a head.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's various
descriptions.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So some people seem
to be describing it

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
as an actual,
mummified human head.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Some people said it was a skull.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people said it was
like a bust, a sculpture.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And then of the sculptures,
there were described

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
heads that were
like a Janus head--

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:90%
two heads, sometimes three.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So what they said was that
they used it for divination.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of their
god, their patron god.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:90%
They spoke to it.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It gave them, they said, wisdom.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It made them rich.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
It made their crops grow.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
They basically
worshipped it as a god.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
After the trials, the subject
got forgotten for a while,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.551 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.419 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
1800s, some people

00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:90%
started writing about it.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
One of them was this guy named
Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He wrote this book
that was in Latin.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But it was all about-- he had
found some artifacts that he

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
said had come from places that
had belonged to the Templars,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:90%
like churches and stuff.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And by artifacts, I mean there
were caskets, bowls, coins,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and also actual idols.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.316 align:middle line:84%
And also, there were
depictions of the idols

00:10:26.316 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:90%
on some of the other items.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So it got several
different pictures

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of this idol that
has horns, and it's

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
like a humanoid with horns.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's hermaphroditic.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:90%
But he said that this Baphomet.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he
said it was Mete

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%
was the name of the figure.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.184 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
like Cybele, he said.

00:10:55.184 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the pictures,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
it looks very much like
the typical depiction

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess Cybele.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
She's got a crown
with towers on it.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But Cybele's not
normally hermaphroditic.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is a variation on that.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So he thought that
they were-- they

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
have a syncretistic
religion that they've

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:90%
made up themselves.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But it includes Gnosticism
and these Cybele rights

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I was telling you about.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
Baphomet was basically

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
a hermaphroditic
creature, not just a head.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But he had some of the head
idols in his pictures also.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So he contributed this
idea that Baphomet was

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:90%
a hermaphroditic goat creature.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then that got picked up
by several other writers,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:90%
like Eliphas Levi.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That was probably 30 years
after this book came out,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
references it in his work.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.915 align:middle line:84%
Eliphas Levi was
an occult writer.

00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:04.994 align:middle line:84%
It would seem like the
most popular tarot deck--

00:12:04.994 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
the writer way of
tarot deck-- a lot

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of that stuff is
inspired by Eliphas Levi.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And the devil in
that deck looks a lot

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:10%
like Eliphas Levi's
depiction of Baphomet.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:10%
The way he depicted
Baphomet became iconic.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I would say when people
think about the devil,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
they think about
Eliphas Levi's picture.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So this figure that
wasn't necessarily

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
the devil in the
beginning became the devil

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in Western occult literature
from that point on.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And Baphomet became
the patron of a lot

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Western occult orders.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's Baphomet
influence in the Freemasons.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And definitely there's this
group called the OTO now,

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
started by Aleister Crowley,
and Aleister Crowley

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:90%
called himself Baphomet.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
He basically felt that
he was an incarnation

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.042 align:middle line:90%
of Baphomet in a way.

00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's not
really necessarily

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a Satanic tradition.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's more about, what you
mentioned, Gnosticism.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me like this is
more of Gnostic tradition.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So what is the Gnostic
tradition as we understand it?

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And how perhaps
were the Templars

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.530 align:middle line:84%
influenced by this
Gnostic lineage?

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: Well, Gnosticism
is kind of a broad category.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
was that there were

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
interpretations of it.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the
most consistent thing

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
is that they all thought
that the God of the Bible

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:90%
was not the highest god.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And the creator god was
not the highest god.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
thought we were

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of a prison made
by that false creator god.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a higher
reality beyond that

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that he's keeping us
from and a higher god

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:90%
beyond that that nobody knows.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So basically the
serpent in the Adam and Eve

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
story, for example, is actually
a liberator in that sense.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Yeah.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of the darker, I would say,
Gnostic groups really-- to me,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like Satanism or
what Satanism became later,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's a complete reversal
of Judeo-Christian belief.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And so like you just mentioned,
the villains of the Bible

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.646 align:middle line:90%
became their heroes.

00:14:33.646 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it
gets even darker.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Many of those groups were
described by the church

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
fathers, writing about all
the different heresies that

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
existed at that time, they
said a lot of these groups

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
were engaging in these
same kind of sick rituals,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
like I was just describing
the Templars doing.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly the ritual
kissing on the behind,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
it shows up over and over
again in these groups.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's an animal,
like a goat or a cat.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And then all of these very
deviant sex rights involving

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
children-- some of these
groups have this idea that you

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't procreate through
sex, because that's like locking

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
a soul into this prison.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so they want to deny
the creator that victory.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So some of them would
basically do a ritual sacrifice

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of a child if it happened to
result from their sex rituals.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
they were basically

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
scoring a victory on the
creator god by doing that.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
this stuff does show up

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
also in the artifacts that
Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:03.467 align:middle line:90%
wrote about.

00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: The sex rituals meaning.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> TWYMAN: Their sex rituals
are all over these artifacts.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:90%
You see people engaging in it.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Men with each other,
men raping boys,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
men having sex with
animals-- and then

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
there's this very interesting
inscription that showed up

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:90%
on several of the artifacts.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And remember, he said that Mete
was the name of the goddess

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and Baphomet was--

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Is it M-E-T-E?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Yeah.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so Baphomet means baptism
of Mete, Mete being wisdom.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So the interpretation
of Baphomet

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
as being baptism of wisdom has
been around since the beginning

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, on these artifacts,
there's this inscription.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And it says this-- the
distinguished charity of Mete

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
uproots the enemy.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Now distinguished
is like peculiar.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
That's how I interpret it.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And charity, the word that
was translated from that,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
it just means love basically.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And it can be interpreted
as both brotherly love

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:90%
or sexual love.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
Hammer-Purgstall is right,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.512 align:middle line:84%
which I think is quite possible,
then the Templars saw both

00:17:22.512 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
of those types of love
as being the same,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that you should have sexual
love with your brother.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So when they say
distinguished charity of Mete

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.745 align:middle line:84%
uproots the enemy, they're
saying the strange love

00:17:34.745 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
of Mete uproots the enemy.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:90%
The enemy is the demiurge.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And they also saw the
planets as being his--

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
they called them archons--
his minions basically.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.205 align:middle line:90%
They control our fate.

00:17:48.205 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So demiurge
being the Jehovah,

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:90%
the Judeo-Christian god?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Right.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And the planets,
his minions-- a lot

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of people who are into astrology
think the planets and stars

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:90%
control our fate.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.815 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
common in the old world.

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It was something that everyone
would have understood.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So on one of those caskets that
Hammer-Purgstall wrote about,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
you actually see Mete
standing there naked.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:90%
She's holding these chains.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're hooked
up to the ceiling.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%
They're going up.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling
these two-- there's

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
a sun and a moon on either side.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So the chains are pulling
the sun and the moon down.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You can tell, because
they're upside down.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:90%
She's pulling them down.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And you got this
inscription there.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
that this is saying

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that there is a way
to actually destroy

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:90%
God's creation by doing this.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might have
been one of their overall goals

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.378 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So essentially,
what we're saying

00:18:52.378 --> 00:18:55.062 align:middle line:84%
is these blasphemous
practices, and obviously, I

00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
don't think it's
limited to the Templars,

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.936 align:middle line:84%
because we've obviously
seen very similar activities

00:18:58.936 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
within the church itself--
pederasty and homosexuality

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what
other activities beyond.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you
mentioned Crowley

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and the Gnostic
tradition thereafter.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that this
Gnostic tradition is ultimately

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to negate the physical,
natural order, natural laws,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
natural boundaries for purposes
of spiritual liberation

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that the idea?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Yeah.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to believe.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
a lot of scholars

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
who write about
Gnostics have thought,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
these charges can't possibly
be true, because how could

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
anyone think that raping
children and killing babies

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:90%
is spiritually enlightening.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the mindset behind it,

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
you can see how it
sort of makes sense

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.515 align:middle line:84%
if you're crazy enough
to believe that.

00:19:50.515 --> 00:19:52.489 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.489 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Obviously the
Templars were very powerful

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:90%
in their time.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.314 align:middle line:84%
And they did have this
massive banking network.

00:19:58.314 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem that
they may have even

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
had an influence
to the present day

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
in the formation
of these banking

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.167 align:middle line:84%
apparatuses-- the
banking structures,

00:20:06.167 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
let's say-- for the
modern world even.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So what can we learn about how
they were banking and perhaps

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
what it might indicate for
the esoteric nature of finance

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and how perhaps there
is a Gnostic component

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.245 align:middle line:84%
to the financial system that
we are now still functioning

00:20:21.245 --> 00:20:22.045 align:middle line:90%
within?

00:20:22.045 --> 00:20:23.465 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Hm, maybe there is.

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll just go
ahead and tell you

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about how they
started the banking system

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and how I think it might have
affected even modern times.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
When they were
chartered, they were

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
created to supposedly
protect pilgrims

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:90%
going to the Holy Land.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:90%
That was their first job.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they later became the
special forces of the Crusades.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
But here's how they did that.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
They had preceptories,
as they called them--

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.176 align:middle line:84%
like little walled, almost
their own cities basically.

00:20:54.176 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Garrisons---

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Yeah.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
They had them all over Europe.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually
travel from wherever

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
you were in Europe to the Holy
Land and hit one of these sites

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
all along the way.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And they created
this thing where

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:84%
you could deposit your
money at the beginning

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and just have what they
called a chip, which

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
was just a coded parchment that
said how much you had put in.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.044 align:middle line:84%
And then every
stop along the way,

00:21:23.044 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
they'll take a little
bit out of your account.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, you can
take your money out.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So they invented the
banking system basically.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And everyone acknowledges this.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now I've written a couple
of books about what

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.965 align:middle line:90%
I call economic alchemy.

00:21:37.965 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who knows about
how modern banking works,

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:84%
they have something called
fractional reserve lending.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually just create
credit and give it to people

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
without anything behind it
or anything backing it up.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I just saw this is as kind
of analogous to alchemy,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
creating gold out of lead.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I started
researching this stuff,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I found that actually there
was a great deal of influence

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
in the development of money
over time by alchemists.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you can actually
see an indication

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
of this when you look at some of
the symbols that are on money.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
alchemical symbols on money,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
even the stuff we use today,
and especially the dollar bill.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I actually spent a lot
of time decoding that.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that whether
these people are necessarily

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
aware of what they're
doing, and whether they've

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
been perpetuating secrets
from Templars, I'm not sure.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like some
of the people that

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
have made very important
decisions in regards

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:84%
to the development of money
were interested in alchemy.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:84%
There's even some
historical examples,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
like Isaac Newton was the
Comptroller of the Currency

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
for a while in England.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
practicing alchemist.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
John Maynard Keynes,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
the economist in
Britain, ended up

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
buying his alchemical
manuscripts from an auction,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
because he was interested
in that subject, too.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.195 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:23:10.195 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, you mentioned you
studied the dollar bill and all

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
the esoteric symbols.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
As we know, the great pyramid
with the all-seeing eye

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
at the top-- there's a hidden
owl in the corner of the 1.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.520 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of esoteric
symbols on the bill itself.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you talk
about what those represent

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and how it could indicate
obviously something more

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.064 align:middle line:90%
of a magical purpose behind it.

00:23:33.064 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: Well, I think
with the dollar bill,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to
jazz it up a little bit.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So this design on the dollar
bill came out at the time

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:84%
when they had just
taken the dollar off

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:90%
of the gold standard.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I think they
wanted to do something

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to instill people's
faith in it, because that

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
was the only thing that was
bringing it any value anymore.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you see all these
messages like e pluribus unum.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
from American history,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
but you put them all
together in a way

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to make people feel like
this is uniting us together.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you're meant
to believe in the dollar

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
the same way you
would believe in God.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.672 align:middle line:90%
Put your faith in this money.

00:24:21.672 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And another interesting
thing-- they've got all

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the 13's all over
it, because I think

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I counted 13 examples of
the number 13 on the dollar.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.267 align:middle line:84%
That's a number that's
associated with alchemy.

00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And also the
Templars, because

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:84%
of Friday the 13th being the
day that Molay was killed.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: There's that, yeah.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure-- I
think there might

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
have been several reasons
why 13 was sacred to them.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think that is definitely
connected with alchemy.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And Baphomet has,
subsequent to the Templars,

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
been interpreted by
Western occultists

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
as being representative
of the power that

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
allows alchemy to happen
and magic, in general--

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that this is the force that
transforms magically one

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:90%
thing into another.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that,
to a certain extent,

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:20.534 align:middle line:84%
that's the power that's still
operating in economics today.

00:25:20.534 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, we talk
about magic and alchemy.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
All this indicates a spiritual
situation, basically,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:84%
on the planet-- a spiritual
being, non-physical reality

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
to the world that people
either can believe in or not.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But based on your experience
in studying these groups that

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
have practiced these
rituals for a reason,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
there are entities,

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it be like Baphomet
or other entities that

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
are non-human,
non-physical, that

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
do exist that do have influence
and power that can help groups

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
like Templars and other
practitioners of ritual

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
magic in their quests, for
example, in their endeavors?

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: I do think so.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course,
just my opinion.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But I've had some
experience myself.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I've contacted some entities
on the Ouija Board before

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and had some other
experiences that made

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:90%
me think this stuff is real.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think once
you start looking

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
at that story from
that perspective--

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the story of the Templars--
it all comes into perspective.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Like how is it that this head
gave them wisdom and made

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
them powerful?

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, because there
really is a demon there.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's still
operating in the world today.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that Baphomet
is still in contact

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.369 align:middle line:84%
with some of the people that
are making decisions today.

00:26:42.369 --> 00:26:44.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you think
Baphomet is a real demon?

00:26:44.285 --> 00:26:45.118 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:26:45.118 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
He matches up with
this entity that's

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
described in the Zohar,
this cabalistic book,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:90%
as being the other god.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's an hermaphroditic
serpent combination

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.410 align:middle line:84%
of Lilith and Samael,
these two demons.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But they describe him
as being the other god.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like this
is the other major power

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in the universe besides, I
guess, the Christian god.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.342 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I think he's real.

00:27:20.342 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The other thing they described
him as in Masonic literature

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is the sun of suns
and the moon of moons.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:84%
This is viewed by a lot
of Western occultists

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:84%
as being the most important
secret really and the biggest

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I think it's--

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.051 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, we talk
about how the Templars were

00:27:42.051 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:84%
disbanded, technically,
by the Catholic church.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But would you say there are
indications of the Templar

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
order actually still
survived in different forms,

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it be through Masonry
and other occult techniques?

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Crowley earlier.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.435 align:middle line:84%
But if, for example, if their
teachings survived, then

00:27:58.435 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
there are those who potentially
are in still positions of power

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
who are practicing
the same techniques,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:84%
the same sexual rituals, the
same bestiality and potentially

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
blood sacrifices as what
the Templars were doing.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: Well,
there's the OTO that--

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to accuse them
of doing anything illegal,

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely
do practice sex magic.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And they call themselves the
Order of Oriental Templars.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the Freemasons who

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
definitely try to tie
themselves in with the Templars.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And scholars argue about whether
there's a real connection

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But again, they're not thinking
about the supernatural aspect.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the way I see it.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I think all of these orders
have, at one point, someone

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
contacting a spiritual
entity and making

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.194 align:middle line:90%
a contract with them.

00:28:45.194 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how these
orders get started.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you do that-- you talk
to Baphomet and contract him

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.922 align:middle line:84%
to be the patron of
your order-- then I

00:28:54.922 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
think you are continuing
the Templar tradition.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.963 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have a
charter from the Templars

00:28:58.963 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:90%
to prove that.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think that any of these
groups that are doing that

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
are a legitimate
continuation of the Templars,

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:84%
because they're in contact with
the legitimate head, the Outer

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.485 align:middle line:90%
Head as they call him.

00:29:09.485 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, obviously
it's a very dark path

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of your research
has taken you into.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But would you say that
ultimately your research

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is helping people to
understand the essential power

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
structure of how the world works
and can actually empower people

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:90%
by that knowledge and awareness?

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: I think that yes,
definitely to realize that

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:84%
people in positions of
power are contacting demons.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And even if they're not
directly in contact,

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:84%
they're maybe in part of an
organization that is receiving

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.330 align:middle line:90%
energy from a demon.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:84%
This is an important
aspect to realize.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And people should really
look at, like I said,

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:90%
the supernatural aspect.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.951 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
looking for conspiracies

00:29:54.951 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure
out how something was

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:90%
engineered by the conspiracy.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
it from this perspective

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and realize that there might
be spiritual influences that

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
are really in control,
inspiring people

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to do certain things
on a grand plan

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they even don't know
where it's leading, if nothing

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
else, it gives you
an understanding

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know how
to fight the injustice

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.060 align:middle line:90%
of the current power structure.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, someday
someone will learn what to do.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what to do,
but hopefully someone can.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But you can also resist
the initiation or the overtures

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
if, for example, if you're
interested in questing

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.236 align:middle line:84%
and to the forms of magic,
it's not only black.

00:30:48.236 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not only dark
side, it would seem.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
practice the negative

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.084 align:middle line:84%
if you want to enhance
your being as a person,

00:30:55.084 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
let's say, and you're
interested by the nature

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.583 align:middle line:84%
of the supernatural,
you're interested

00:30:58.583 --> 00:30:59.774 align:middle line:90%
by the spiritual quest.

00:30:59.774 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:90%
There's obviously two paths.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can resist the
temptations and the darkness--

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
the opportunities that are
offered by the dark side, that

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:90%
can be resisted as well, no?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: I'm sure.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And even Baphomet,
interestingly,

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:90%
has a light side.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
They basically describe him
as being a combination of God

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and the Devil, a combination of
the heavenly and the infernal.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So this has always been
referred to in Western occultism

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
as the big secret is can you
somehow balance the greatest

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:84%
powers in the universe, the
greatest conflicting powers,

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and tap into them
both at the same time

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:90%
without being destroyed.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there are some
people that do that and go

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.340 align:middle line:90%
the bad way, the bad route.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And then some people do that
and retain their morality

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and are good people.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.695 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I definitely think
that there's two paths.

00:31:52.695 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I even think that the Gnostics,
like I was saying before,

00:31:55.070 --> 00:32:00.232 align:middle line:84%
I think there were nice
versions and mean versions.

00:32:00.232 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But I think that's a
fascinating way to explain it.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:84%
In the day, there are always
going to be two options.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:84%
But the middle path
might be actually

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:84%
the sanest, the
safest one possible

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
where you're not trying
to pretend to be something

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:90%
that you're not.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, when you try
to be too good, as you end up

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:84%
with these orders
like the Catholics

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.497 align:middle line:84%
and others who appeared on
the surface to be all-knowing,

00:32:21.497 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:84%
all-wise, all-loving,
and then they're

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:90%
practicing things in the dark.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're saying
the middle path is actually

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful, the safest,
the most pure and true, no?

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> TWYMAN: That's
been my estimation.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm so confused, at this
point, after looking

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:90%
at all this material.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who to pray to.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
the real god is.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think the safest
thing is to, like you said,

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
stay in the middle and hope
that it all clears itself up

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Balance being the key.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Yeah.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
joining me today, Tracy.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> TWYMAN: Thank you very much.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.284 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I really
appreciate your time.

00:32:57.284 --> 00:32:59.491 align:middle line:84%
Well, there you go, folks--
some fascinating insights

00:32:59.491 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
from Tracy Twyman.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with
or believe everything

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that she has said
here, but I really

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.479 align:middle line:84%
urge you to check out her
books, because they're

00:33:05.479 --> 00:33:06.514 align:middle line:90%
full of details.

00:33:06.514 --> 00:33:08.180 align:middle line:84%
As she mentioned,
"The Baphomet Mystery"

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is 600 pages, really
well worth the read

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:90%
if you want to explore more.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The road to truth
is a perilous path,

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.340 align:middle line:84%
but that's why we walk
the edge of the Buzzsaw.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you are
the revolution.
