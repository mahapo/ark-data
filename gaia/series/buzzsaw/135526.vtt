00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Could "Avatar" be
based on a true story?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And is it happening
right in front of us?

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.404 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:08.792 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:18.925 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:10%
And with me today
is Jordao Souza.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
Jordao is the grandson
of Padrinho Sebastiao,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.145 align:middle line:10%
a known spiritual leader within
plant medicine traditions.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.224 align:middle line:84%
In 1985, his father,
Paulo Roberto Souza,

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
led the scientific
commission that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
convinced the Brazilian
government to legalize plant

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
medicines for religious uses.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the first from
outside the Yawanawa tribe

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to complete the year-long
intense spiritual initiation

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:90%
of muca.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And today, Jordao joins
me to discuss all of this,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as shamanism and the
importance of the Amazon.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start by
asking you about, really,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
what is the Yawanawa tribe
and their spiritual tradition

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:90%
that you were initiated into?

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:10%
>> So the Yawanawa, they come
from the [INAUDIBLE] trunk.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
They are in the
north part of Amazon.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And they hold an ancestral
knowledge [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced by
them through my father

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
when I was 15 years old.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And there, I was able
to fully experience

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
a new way of existence,
a new way of connection

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:84%
to nature, our relatives,
and the creative force.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I mentioned in
the opening that "Avatar"--

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is basically, I
think, an accurate portrayal

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%
of their existence, right?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's completely divorced from
modern science, technology,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
and ways of living, right?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They're very much in tune
with their environment

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and, as you say, their ancestral
traditions and techniques.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a bit about
the spiritual initiation

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
you had to go through.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So a little before that, I
was born in Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The connection that I have
with indigenous people

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
was much more through my
school, or the history classes,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:84%
where the indigenous
people, they

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
seemed something from the past
or something that does not even

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:90%
exist anymore.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I was able to
meet them and see how real

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and how developed
they are, it started

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
awakening in me many
gifts and abilities for me

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
to develop that in
the city, I did not

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
have the right situation
or conditions for it.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So it was when I started
seeing the communication

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:90%
of the whole tribe.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But two people
specifically, they

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:90%
caught a lot of my attention.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
The two people, the two
shamans, they're still alive,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and is the holders of the
whole ancestral knowledge

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Yawanawas.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
One is called Paje Tata,
and other, Paje Yawa.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Paje is the Portuguese
word for shaman.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so for me to go
there and experience

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
the clarity they have in their
mind, the energy they have

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to go on with
ceremony and rituals

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole night,
and be over 100 years old,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:90%
it really shook up my attention.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:90%
So over 100 years old.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And this goes against
the whole notion

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.724 align:middle line:84%
that, well, you have
to have modern medicine

00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and be in modern society
to have a long life, right?

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It was when they visit our
community in Rio de Janeiro

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that my father had many
surgeries on his back.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.965 align:middle line:84%
And so me, as his
son, I accompanied

00:03:55.965 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
his whole procedure, how it was
for him to take heavy stuff.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And they went there and
did a healing on him.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm snowboarding with
him in double black diamonds

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:90%
tracks.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So this really caught
up my attention.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the
healing procedure?

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Is only through
the Western drugs?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something
else around there?

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the
shamanic tradition,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.715 align:middle line:84%
because obviously
it's a global thing

00:04:26.715 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:90%
from the ancient cultures.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it means,
basically, like a medicine

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
man or a healer, right?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So describe how do
shamans practice

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and what is the work they do.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole stance of the
shamans is directly to the path

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
They start first with
the self-knowledge.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And once you are able
to know yourself more,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
you are able to connect
with the forest.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So the shamans, they are able
to interchange with the forest,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
not only in the physical
aspect, but also the spiritual.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But in order for you to do this,
you need a spiritual authority.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And this authority,
you can only get it

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.537 align:middle line:90%
through this initiation of muca.

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
So what is muca?

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Muca is a medicine that
you can take only once

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:10%
in your life.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.195 align:middle line:84%
It's a root,
similar as a potato.

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It does not have
any psycho effect,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
but it contains
the spiritual part

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
of the forest in that potato.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:90%
You don't even eat it.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
You just chew and
swallow the juice off it.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Very, very bitter.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
By doing this, you're entering
a whole procedure of planting

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:90%
a spirit inside of you.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So once you're
planting a seed, you've

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
got to create the
right conditions

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
so it can die, and
grow, and flourish.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And these right conditions is
the renunciation of many things

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that, for them, really
cause the disconnection.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's one year
renunciation of any type

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:90%
of sweets, any type of fruit.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
They say that
water is too sweet.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's from water on.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So for one year, you do
not drink pure water.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be bitter or sour.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
There's the whole thing
about the blood too.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot eat
any type of meat.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
You just eat some
type of small fishes.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
There's also
different renunciation

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
of sex for this period of-- so
you get something more inside.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
perspective of yourself.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And these are just
the standards.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
This is just the platform
so you can really

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.231 align:middle line:90%
develop from there on.

00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is basically what
you have to go through in order

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.813 align:middle line:90%
to become a shaman, right?

00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.045 align:middle line:84%
>> You've gone
through this process.

00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure in this experience,
you started to see things

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
beyond the normal
realm of understanding.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.251 align:middle line:84%
Did you encounter
beings, entities,

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
things that people
would call alien,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, or angels
and demons, basically?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:90%
But this type of reality beyond?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because these platforms
open you to get in touch with

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
a new realm, with
a spiritual realm.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
That is where the spiritual
presence of the forest

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:90%
inhabits.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a shaman.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I was initiating
the shaman path,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a lifetime study.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.235 align:middle line:84%
>> So together with this, I
was able to fully renounce

00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
for everything-- the
diet in the beginning,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
there is a very strict with the
quantity of food and drinks you

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:90%
can have.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.835 align:middle line:84%
So the first week, I did not
have energy at all to move.

00:08:09.835 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the death
process you talked about.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.575 align:middle line:84%
So it puts you in an
introspective mode.

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you cannot even
count of your own body,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
you've got to dive inside.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So in this process, it is very,
very deep into the forest.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And for you to
have a brief idea,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
from Rio de Janeiro,
my city, I got

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
to take two planes,
two flights, to Rio

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Branco, the capital of Acre.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a nine-hour
car drive, and then

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
a seven-hours boat drive, and
then you arrive at the village.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual
center is even deeper.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So for four months, I
was there with contact

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:90%
with only four people.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And these four people was--
the main one who was best known

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to me was Paje Tata.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And he started sharing
with me a little bit

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:84%
about their tradition and
how you get that connection.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a strong
process, because this can only

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
be confirmed, the development
of your diet or your initiation,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in your dreams.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.969 align:middle line:84%
That's why the dreams are
so important for us humans.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we've forgotten
how important these

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
are to expressing maybe where
our spiritual mindstate is,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But it seems to me that
when connecting to the entities

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and the force itself,
the spirit of the forest,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.737 align:middle line:84%
people always say Mother
Earth, the earth is bountiful

00:09:45.737 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and giving, and it's good.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lot of
darkness inside the earth.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We see this in the
nature of everything

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:90%
eats something in our reality.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's feeding.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
There is also the
dark side to it.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So did you experience
this in understanding

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit of the earth
is both dark and light?

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
That there is also
what people might

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
call demonic and scary
forces that you have to face,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
as well your fears,
as well as the light?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, for sure, because
for me to experience the inner

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
light, you've got to go
through the darkness.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So the earth spirit is showing
me the creation and destruction

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
process that happens
on the earth,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and how you need to find your
balance and alignment to be

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
at the right point right there.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So I had big encounters
with the forest itself,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
because there's many experience
you have that you can limit to,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
oh no, this was a
experience from my mind.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But once I was able to be
in the center of the Amazon,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and I would get that
feedback from the forest

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
as I was going through a
big process in the middle

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of the diet, and suddenly,
I was thinking about going

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the other direction.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I was having some doubt,
not clarification.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then a huge green
shooting star just crossed.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I was sleepy and had a
very, very intense dream.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was awakened by a bird.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And this bird looked
at me and started

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:90%
guiding me through the forest.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I would go near him, he
would fly to another tree,

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and so on, until I found
a very, very sacred space.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So once we are able to
fully clean ourselves

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
from the impurities
that we put, we

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
are able to get that sync,
that through connection,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously the
indigenous tribes know this,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that we live in societies
that are very disconnected.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the ways that we've

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
disconnected as human beings
in our modern society,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through addictions
and maybe drug abuse,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
television?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.216 align:middle line:84%
I mean, tell us
some of the things

00:12:09.216 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that were talked about as far
as how we are being hypnotized,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.185 align:middle line:84%
even, by maybe dark forces
that want to keep us hypnotized

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and disconnected.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I think a little
bit about that is the whole

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:90%
separation that happened.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the main difference
about the native nations

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and us as modern civilization.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a big disconnection
from Mother Earth

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
as understanding
that we are part

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:90%
of a system that is going on.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And by creating a
different system,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
we open to a lot
of possibilities

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to harm ourselves.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So this separation going many
levels, from the level of cause

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
more awareness, where
you can see the sun

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can sleep
together with that,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and you get your time
based on nature's cycle,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:90%
with the electricity.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.685 align:middle line:84%
We see this already when
[INAUDIBLE] in big cities,

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you cannot see the stars or
get oriented by sun and moon.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about
the healing process,

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
because this whole
separation and system

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are right now, together
with our transportation,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
the way we feel-- all this has
created many, many diseases

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
that comes from the separation.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So once we understand
that and we're

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
able to seek through
this connection again,

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
there's many things
that'll be left behind.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.552 align:middle line:90%
Most certainly many diseases.

00:13:46.552 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And also gives the
clarity of the path--

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
the path that we as
humankind are training.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So once we are
disconnected from it,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
we start losing a little bit
the sense of what's going on,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:90%
why we're here.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where many drugs
come in as a matter of escape,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of destruction happen.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, the main
separation that came

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:19.589 align:middle line:84%
was the lack of respect and
gratitude for the forest.

00:14:19.589 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And so let's talk about
that, because, I mean,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:84%
we've seen it in
stories like "Avatar,"

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
where basically it's talking
about how indigenous tribes

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
like the Yawanawa are basically
targeted because they are

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
of the protectors, the
guardians of the forest.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And here we see these
massive corporations

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
going in to build dams, and
mines, and cut down the trees.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a, how bad
is their designs?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:84%
How bad is it really
affecting you know the forest?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And are the tribes being
targeted because they're trying

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.505 align:middle line:90%
to keep the corporations out?

00:14:52.505 --> 00:14:53.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
The rate that we are facing,
specifically with Amazon,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
is getting insane.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, the
rate of deforestation

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
was about one football
field per minute.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is already
big, big numbers.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, depending
on the season,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
we can get to 20 to 30
football fields per minute.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So this, it comes
by a lack of respect

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.124 align:middle line:84%
and also a little
bit of ignorance,

00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
because most of the forests-- I
always say all besides Amazon--

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
they came after our
last glacier era.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Amazon is based on
2 million years old.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It survived the
last glacier era.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So it was a Pleistocene refuge.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:84%
All this time gave a lot of
time to life to proliferating

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:90%
to a huge biodiversity.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
That is the main importance
of Amazon being that old.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And the native people
that inhabit there,

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
they have the knowledge
of all that plants

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and all the material.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So they are guardians
not only of the forest,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
but also from the practical
use of the medicines

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:90%
and the plants.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And by moving them away, you
cannot expect they will keep

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
their tradition
without their plants,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:90%
without their whole culture.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So by doing this, it's
creating a real problem,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
not only with the
deforestation, but also

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
with the situation
of the Amazon.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Amazon, for me, what
it's facing right now,

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of
Alexandria Library, who

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
contains a lot of precious
knowledge from antiquity,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
but is being burned,
or was burned.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.415 align:middle line:84%
And the forest is
being burned right now.

00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:10.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:10.215 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So the big corporations,
instead of wanting to study all

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that-- because for
all native tribes,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
they say our Mother Amazon
is our main drugstore.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't need
anything else from it.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
>> But it seems to me that
the corporations basically--

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
like the story
"Medicine Man," right?

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Either they don't
have any care--

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.018 align:middle line:84%
because remember
in "Medicine Man,"

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
he found this plant that
could cure-- I think

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.616 align:middle line:90%
it was cancer in the story.

00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:38.906 align:middle line:84%
But the point was that there's
all these medicines that

00:17:38.906 --> 00:17:39.867 align:middle line:90%
are in the Amazon.

00:17:39.867 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And the corporations
just go in there,

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.386 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking to mine
and destroy the ecosystem,

00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:90%
and they don't consider it.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.859 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, there's
this tremendous ignorance.

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But then we're also seeing
the pharmaceutical companies

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
basically taking possession of
the drugs and patenting them,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and processing them,
and basically making

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.619 align:middle line:84%
them more toxic than they
would have been if they were

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
actual plant medicine,
if we actually

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.599 align:middle line:84%
went back closer to the
earth for our drugs.

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It seems that corporations
have two fronts.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
One is, let's control
and patent the drugs,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and then let's destroy it so no
one else can access it, right?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why we were talking
about the separation,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.290 align:middle line:84%
because by separating this,
they have all the control

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:90%
of the healing.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But once you synthesize, also
for our indigenous tradition,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
you take the spirit
of the plant itself,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
so its healing purpose can
have other effects as well.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we have been
seeing with many Western drugs

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
how they can heal something,
but at the other side,

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
unlock a whole new chain of
reaction concerning diseases.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the indigenous tribes
being targeted, basically,

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:90%
for murder or relocation?

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it a real war against
the indigenous tribes currently

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
going on in the Amazon?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
The Yawanawa, they are a
very, very good example

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
about the alliance
being made, because many

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous people
who had that encounter

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:84%
with white people, they
were really damaged.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.185 align:middle line:90%
So they closed themself.

00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So once they closed
themselves, they are easy,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
easy preys for the logging, the
ranchers, the soy plantations.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:90%
They'll come in.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, they shrink,
shrink, until they disappear.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But the Yawanawa, they had
a different stance for it,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
where they opened seeking
alliance and allies that can

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:84%
understand the process more than
them and help them in what they

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:90%
cannot understand.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's many tribes that are
facing this problem right now,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:90%
mainly with dams.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about
the electricity to-- they

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
are moving a lot of
indigenous people out

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:90%
of their natural place.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's something-- because
you can move them and think

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
they will keep the tradition.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
really fine theme,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.142 align:middle line:84%
as how you keep the
tradition of the Japanese

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
if you take them to a
place where there's fish

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:90%
for them to cook sushi.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's something similar
that is happening.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
the danger that

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
is growing with the
indigenous people,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
but also with the
environment as well.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you build dams, the whole,
we call [INAUDIBLE] salmon,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
where the salmons that do
go upriver to proliferate,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:90%
these all got [? squashed ? ].

00:20:54.730 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And once you mess with the
fish, in the food chain,

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a big, big, big
damage that happens.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain
sense, I would say

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that the Yawanawa are very much
representative of us as humans.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.695 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have to
take this-- there's an evil.

00:21:16.695 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There's an evil
out there, right?

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the evil in this
case is oftentimes

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:84%
represented by these
corporations that have no face.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And they just go, and they
take, and they consume,

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:90%
and they try to control.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And they disconnect us from our
roots, our ancestry, our plant

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
medicines, and our healing
abilities, and each other.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So is this the spiritual
journey of us here on earth?

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this basically
what it's about, is us

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:84%
waking up to realizing that
we are being manipulated,

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and controlled, and
hypnotized, and abused,

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and we have to wake up if
we're going to stop this?

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because there was
something that we cannot judge

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
so much the white
people, the civilization,

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:84%
because there were many
good things created.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And going on the
path, on the past,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
we see the need for survivors.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But now it's important
for us to understand

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:90%
that this was already past.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
We are reaching now a different
area, where our technologies

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
influence us and
help us in a way

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need to
accumulate, accumulate,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
accumulate.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the native
people have a lot to add.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
It's to bring back.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the reconnection
that for many, many years,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
there was that path
going straight.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen where it's
going-- towards the destruction

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, towards the
whole imbalance between people,

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the lack of respect and love.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So I believe the indigenous,
they still carry that.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're the
guardians of the forest.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And they have lived in
there for 10,000 years

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and keeping the sustainability.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have a lot to
teach us, most certainly.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Our real path here is to
get to know ourselves.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
How can we be living here
together as one big community

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
in this planet?

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And how can we always push
through humankind development?

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ways it seems that
people are starting to wake up

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
is one of the plant
medicines like ayahuasca,

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:84%
where we're seeing many people
in the United States now

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Western world are
taking it for the first time.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.596 align:middle line:84%
10, 15 years ago, no one
knew about ayahuasca, right?

00:23:40.596 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So do you think this
is a positive sign

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.803 align:middle line:84%
of people awakening, that they
are taking this plant medicine?

00:23:44.803 --> 00:23:46.505 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think
there's also a danger

00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that maybe people
are abusing it or not

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
understanding the
healing process entirely

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:90%
before taking it?

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca is not so
much my field of expertise.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But talking a general place
about the plants' medicine

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
is I feel this is already
a great awakening sign.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But with everything now, you've
got to be really careful.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So the plants' medicines
now, they have the power

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to really show us, based
on our own experience

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and our own path, how can
we seek for disconnection

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and how can we attain
a more pure connection

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in all areas-- horizontal,
vertical, and the environment.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
it's important to keep

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
in the tradition.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's already many,
many good and positive cases

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of-- one that
happened in Brazil.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca was
taken into the prisons.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And the people
there who took were

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
fully able to understand, repent
from what they did, and they

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
were having the higher rates
of behaving-- you know,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.705 align:middle line:90%
behaving well.

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And many of them
were even leaving after.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So once, with the help
of the plants' medicines,

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:90%
we can get that connection back.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that when
people take a plant medicine,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and even going back
to hallucinogens,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that they're ultimately
seeing through the veil?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
That there are like I asked
before, entities-- you know,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:84%
aliens, spiritual beings, that
are beyond the third dimension?

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.236 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just showing
us our own mind?

00:25:47.236 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a big difference
in the plants' medicines about

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the term hallucinogenic
and the entheogenic.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The hallucinogenic came
first when they did not

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:90%
know how to communicate.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, why do it
happen when you eat that?

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Or what's happened
when you drink that?

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And the native people started
drawing many patterns.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So then they hallucinate,
because the hallucination's

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
the perception without
the object, right?

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So the plants' medicine,
after a French researcher

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:84%
did a deeper study, they are
called entheogenical plants.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
That gets you the connection
with the creator force.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And by this, there's
a big difference,

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
where once you are in
a hallucinogenic state,

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:84%
you lose completely notion
about time, space, your identity

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:90%
reference, and all this.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.064 align:middle line:84%
So it puts you in a
very dangerous aspect.

00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Sort of out of your mind.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So once you enter in
the entheogenical,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
you can have visions, insights,
revelations with your eyes

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the point
you open your eyes,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you are good to drive a car,
to start a conversation,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:90%
to talk about yourself.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's this big
differentiation on those terms.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the entheogenical, what
the indigenous people taught

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
us is you seek the connection
with the greater force,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
with the creator force they
believe that created all this.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was a main
channel for them

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to receive insights, revelations
in this path of knowledge

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.624 align:middle line:90%
that is the shaman [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:50.624 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you optimistic,
ultimately,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.026 align:middle line:90%
that people are waking up?

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
That our consciousness
is rising?

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:90%
That we're connecting to self?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
That we can actually
basically save our planet

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:84%
from destruction from
the continued destruction

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
by the corporations
and whatnot that

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:84%
keep gobbling up our
connection to the earth,

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and the resources of the
earth, and pollution,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
all these consequences
of their actions?

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.785 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that we have hope?

00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:16.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes.

00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:17.385 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:21.445 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe on
that, because it

00:28:21.445 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is about what I'm seeing
not only in my daily life,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
the children, the awareness
that already come,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:84%
the connection that comes,
the new generations that

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.545 align:middle line:84%
are bringing, but also
the system itself,

00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
it beneficiates just a
very little percentage.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So for very little
number to be very--

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a big mass that is
living under a great suffering.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I truly believe that once
we are able to fully understand

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
what is going on, the path
that people are taking us,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and that we have the
choice, and we can choose

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:84%
to go in one
direction or another,

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
big change is coming.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
it's not something

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:90%
that can be like a explosion.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
gradually happens.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.985 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual
evolution of humankind

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:84%
grows in a different rate than
the technological evolution,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot of hope that
many in the new generations,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:84%
because I as a
young people can see

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that we can look back and see
many good things that happen,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
but I also see many things that
is not in the right alignment.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So once we feel that and
understand that being young,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
it's easier for us, once
we get into a older age,

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.522 align:middle line:84%
to pass down that to
the young generations.

00:29:57.522 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I appreciate
your insight.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I really commend
you for your work.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And keep spreading and
raising that awareness

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and celebrating the
indigenous cultures,

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:84%
because we obviously
need to protect them.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:90%
They are our link to the past.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for joining
me today, Jordao.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks so much
for the opportunity.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And there you have it, folks.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.335 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Jordao Souza.

00:30:18.335 --> 00:30:20.709 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything he said here

00:30:20.709 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge you to
check out his website,

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:10%
indigenouscelebration.org,
for more details on his cause

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:10%
to help save the Yawanawa tribe
and their ancient traditions.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and you are the revolution.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:44.182 align:middle line:90%
