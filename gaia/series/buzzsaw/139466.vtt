>>SEAN STONE: Is there
a purpose for humanity?

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.072 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the buzzsaw.

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:07.516 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.516 --> 00:00:17.912 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Welcome to
"Buzzsaw," where

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.995 align:middle line:84%
we cut through the
mainstream narrative

00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:22.300 align:middle line:90%
to explore the hidden truths.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:10%
is Regina Meredith, host of
"Open Minds" here on Gaia.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Regina began her
career in journalism

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.526 align:middle line:84%
as one of the first women to
enter the world of television

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:90%
sports broadcasting on NBC.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
She co-anchored weekly
coverage with Bryant Gumbel.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Taking a break to raise
family, she moved to Sacramento

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and started her production
company, LuminArt Productions,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
where her first projects
began to educate people

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
on environmental issues
that aired on PBS.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
As her career progressed,
so did her exploration

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
into the world of esoteric
and hidden sciences.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Today she joins us to open our
perspectives on human evolution

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:10%
So I want to start by
asking you would you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
consider yourself a
psychic or a channel,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.942 align:middle line:10%
or are those not
the right words?

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Well,
those are probably not

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:10%
the right words because I
don't exhibit those traits

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:10%
in a classic sense.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people I interview
and know in my life in Sedona,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.614 align:middle line:84%
obviously, are highly intuitive
where they can't turn it off.

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So moment in and moment
out, they're looking at you.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes are wandering.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
These little sounds
of alarm going on

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
because they're
seeing all the time.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It's wide open.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like that.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
My primary mode of
accessing information

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
comes from a very deep
sense of just kind

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:90%
of knowing and feeling.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm very attuned to that.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So if something doesn't feel
right, I do not go there.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But if I have to be
cast into a situation,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
like in a workshop or an
experiment or something, where

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you have to use your
intuitive capabilities,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:90%
then the gates are wide open.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I've even studied a little bit
with military remote viewing,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, and been able to
get the targets and so forth.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's there.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:90%
It's intact.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.475 align:middle line:84%
But it's only when
I call upon it.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of
convenient, so I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.987 align:middle line:84%
don't have to see dead
people around other people.

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you have
psychic abilities.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But you have had contact
with some beings or entities.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Lots.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: OK.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And so are these--

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:90%
would you consider them alien?

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.246 align:middle line:90%
Interdimensional?

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: A little
bit of everything.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all people are
surrounded with these entities.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody who doesn't have
some contingent around them,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:84%
of guides, whether they're
from other dimensional realms,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're ETs
that are able to kind

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
of phase in close enough
to be able to get contact.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The human being is a really
interesting, complex in

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that probably the hardest thing
for us to be able to access

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is ourselves, to
get to that really

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
fine, fine, beautiful,
highly intelligent, highly

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
creative aspect of
self that continues

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
beyond physical death.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
That part-- some call it the
soul, some call it spirit,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
soul development, whatever
you want to call it--

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is much harder for us
to be in direct contact

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
with than it is for these other
beings who kind of intercede

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:90%
on our own behalf.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The soul will have a
directive, for example,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:84%
but then it will
take a go-between

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of sorts that can reach into
this dense, conscious mind

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
complex of ours,
knock us on the head,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
put in a vision or
a word or a feeling

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then hear
the message of our own soul.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I'm reminded of what
Socrates called his demon.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.234 align:middle line:84%
That was the concept of this
messenger, this being that

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
was essentially an entity that
was with him, that gave him

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
inspiration and insight,
his personal genie, genius,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.854 align:middle line:90%
but it also could be a jinn.

00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly, it could
be a jinn, which, of course,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
we know would be more toward
the demonic realm in some cases,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
in terms of putting people
at odds with themselves

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than making
more congruency inside.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So I rely very
heavily on my ability

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the beings that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
surround me and my own
feeling because a lot of times

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
the way to work
best with me is just

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
zap a feeling right through
and I'll get it instantly.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.517 align:middle line:84%
And then it helps put
pieces together, too.

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So in terms
of your experience

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
with these various
entities, what

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
do you take away from the
nature of the dimensionality

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:90%
of our existence?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We obviously know
we're four dimensions.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is in who
knows how many dimensions

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%
beyond imagination, beyond it.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:90%
So what do you--

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
what do you take away of
that, about the number

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of intersecting dimensions
that are influencing

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and impacting us at any moment?

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I think there are
numerous dimensions we're not

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
even aware of, and
there are subtle nuances

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and subdimensions within those.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But by and large,
I think all one

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
needs to be aware of is that
they are multi-dimensional,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and that the goal
of this journey

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
is to reintegrate with the
highest aspect of self, which

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.057 align:middle line:84%
is in a much finer frequency
range than this part,

00:04:39.057 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind,
which is the least

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:90%
conscious part of our being.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
One of my beings said one
time somewhat jokingly,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
it didn't go the way it
was originally planned.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that the full
consciousness of the being

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
would be there to essentially
create, and create the life,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
create the events, the
experiences, create the day.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And instead, because
we are trapped

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
in this physical matrix, which
has mortality attached to it,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.956 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind, what we call
the conscious mind, took over.

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, the
conscious mind was

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
only to keep you from
bumping into things.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: That simple.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.826 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: We've forgotten about
the power of the unconscious

00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and the magical
reality of our world,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and we focused instead on
this limited conscious logic,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
scientifically discernible
within three dimensions

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:90%
physicality.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we're oriented
towards survival.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're
oriented toward survival,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to have only
that which can be proven.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the materialist
scientific materialism

00:05:39.457 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're trapped in right
now sees to it that we

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
don't look beyond that.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.101 align:middle line:84%
And that's what gets you into
a lot of other conspiracy

00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.685 align:middle line:84%
theories, is why is
that, for example.

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:47.484 align:middle line:90%
You can go on.

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But I really like to stick
more with what we actually are,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
which is this very
interesting experiment.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding of it is
a little different than most

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:90%
people's.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.656 align:middle line:84%
I've been exposed to a lot
of the different theories

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of
humankind, and the one

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that I seem to
resonate the most with

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is one that does not have
this as a conspiracy,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:84%
does not have us
as a slave species.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It has us as a species
that through circumstance

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
had to integrate
with an animal form,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:90%
and thus the problems began.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.669 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: OK.

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So our being is essentially
nonphysical in its true sense.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: If you look
at the human being,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:84%
you could if you wanted
to for ease's sake,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
divide it up, you
would say the be-ing,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
the higher aspect
of ourselves that

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
transcends physical reality
where literally it exists for

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:90%
experience itself.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:90%
It has no fear.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, some
people, you've met

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
some people that actually
live in closer association

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.004 align:middle line:90%
with their true self.

00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Have you met some
of those people,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.347 align:middle line:84%
where they don't have the normal
fears that other people have?

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:55.305 align:middle line:84%
Some might even call them
careless or reckless.

00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
self-destructive people.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about people that
don't see boundaries and see

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:90%
the capability in all things.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.948 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: They just
have to wish to go there.

00:07:04.948 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
You're from L.A.
You see a lot of it.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
You probably grew
up around a lot

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of people that had this notion
that they couldn't be stopped.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The sky and beyond
was the limit.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, that is
actually living truer to what

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:84%
we really are than the other
kinds of lives where we put

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in little boxes,
separate our desires,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
the sparks that really
juice us up in life,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:84%
separate those out and put
them to the side as frivolous

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get on with
our day and pay our bills--

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that's the animal
mind way of living.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But we ultimately
had to incarnate

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
into this physical body.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.535 align:middle line:84%
And describe to us a little bit
what that process of evolution

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:90%
actually looked like.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
At what point did the
human consciousness

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.967 align:middle line:84%
enter the physical
body, physical form?

00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, that gets
us into this alternate story

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.175 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of
human kind, which I have

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:90%
been doing lectures on lately.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And initially, I didn't
speak about it for 30 years.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The simple reason is because
look how many stories exist.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that seem to
have a law of attraction

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that have
been repeated over time.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have anything
to do with logic.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And what struck me was
that I'm supremely logical.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And going to these various
conferences, even ones

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that I've participated
in as a speaker,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:84%
you'll see this
split in the psyche

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
where you have the rational,
scientific mind that

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is the intention
of the conference,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
for example, trying to meet with
on some level consciousness,

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
And where that happens,
there is a huge schism

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
in the psyche of
a lot of people.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, this
has to be rational.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Your story needs to be rational.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, why?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Why does it?

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It has to feel-- you have to
feel the congruency of it.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
If you can't feel that,
then the story has no value.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
No matter what story you're
being told in the world,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't feel
congruent within your being,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:90%
you should discard it.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And I can say from a very
early time in my own life

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:90%
in organized religion--

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I was raised kind of a Dower
Lutheran, Missouri Synod

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Lutheran--

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.075 align:middle line:84%
there was no magic
there for sure.

00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot of stories
that made no sense to me.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So I started checking out
on that by the age of five.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They were ans-- I
would ask questions

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and it had no basis
in logic, the answers

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:90%
had no basis in logic.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So as I go through, I'm seeing
these conferences that where

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
the organizers and the speakers
might be into the Vedas,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
all creation comes out

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of a lotus blossom from the
tummy button of the creator.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And you look at that and
say, is that logical?

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.453 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, it's like
saying all the universe is

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
on the shell, on the
back of a tortoise.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And then, well, what
is the turtle standing on?

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.541 align:middle line:84%
Well, the turtle, the
turtle is all the way down.

00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.866 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: That infinism.

00:09:46.866 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So if
you look at it,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
all religions, all of these
fables about the origins

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
of the species have
been passed down usually

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
from an inspired
source to a receiver,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
a recipient of some kind.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This story is no
different in that way,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that it was passed down to
a woman who lives basically

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:90%
in obscurity.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
She's a channel that does
not really choose to channel.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to
channel to begin with.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
So no one can reach her.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They can't get a
channeling from her.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.516 align:middle line:84%
But it was the most
profound information

00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:15.197 align:middle line:84%
I had access to for 30 years
that I've been exposed to.

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And what was that story?

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And that story was
that as the Earth was forming--

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:90%
no big bang, first of all.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
They cut that right out.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't no big bang.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That the development of
things like planetary systems,

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos itself happened in
a much more orderly fashion.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of first,
there's the blueprint.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can argue about who's
the provider of the blueprint.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it the gods?

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it a god head?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But a form of intelligence
or vast forms of intelligence

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
can create capabilities
levels that we

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:90%
can't at this point in time.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We're vastly
creative, but can you

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
conceive of the beauty
and intricacy of even

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
a simple blossom like a rose?

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring that out
of nothing and create that?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So there is some kind of
intelligence that was going on,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and you might say multiple
intelligences that

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
create the universe, that
create the planetary systems

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%
and the planets themselves.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth was no
different in this story.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It could
frankly be strings.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
A sense of the string theory
and the idea of resonance

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and vibration once you have--

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
once the string is
plucked, it resonates

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and everything finds its
order, its natural harmony.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: That's part of it.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Vibration, whatever the
natural gases or particles

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that are available in that
quadrant of the universe that

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
are available, intension,
time, and movement.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:90%
A lot of movement and spin.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We all know about that
word from Stuart Hameroff.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
on a macro scale,

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that as the Earth
was forming, there

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
was an area with beings who were
in a dimension of Earth that

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.665 align:middle line:90%
was beyond the Earth.

00:11:51.665 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
What was beyond-- it was
not physical any longer.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:84%
The beings were at very high
levels of consciousness,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
very high levels of creativity.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.292 align:middle line:84%
They could create at
the speed of thought.

00:12:03.292 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we'll see in
the nominalist situations,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.749 align:middle line:90%
that happens in our own lives.

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:90%
That's our capability.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:90%
That's our innate capability.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
They were more-- this
was a species that had

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:90%
no need for conflict or war.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:90%
They're nonphysical.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They would look like a shimmer
to your eye passing by.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And these beings were
able to simply peer in

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to the dimension of Earth itself
as it was developing with all

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:90%
of its complex life forms.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And that part takes a
very, very, very long time,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything we can
comprehend on time frames,

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I think, when you're looking
at the formation of a star

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:90%
or planet.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.505 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, we know this
planet's at least, what,

00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:90%
five, six billion years old

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: At least.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Even the Vedas would put
it way older than that.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And so as this was
forming, these beings

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in a higher dimension of what
is Earth were able to peer in.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They were only able to do
this because there was--

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
as they explained to
us, the thing that

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
makes Earth Earth was
this anomaly in that

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
other dimensional beings were
able to not only peer in,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, start
kind of traversing back

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and forth between the
forming Earth, which

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
was in a much higher
frequency range

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
before it started slowing
down, slowing down, and coming

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
into the full third dimensional
density that we know.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.791 align:middle line:84%
It took we don't know
how-- we won't even

00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:84%
put a number of years to it,
but over a long period of time.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:90%
These are nonphysical beings.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They have all the
time in the world--

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
were able to go back
and forth and begin

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
looking in on experiencing
the developing lifeforms.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Now when Edgar Cayce
talks about the formation

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
of Earth and the
original people,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%
his story is very similar.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
This channel and Edgar Cayce
go back historically together.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
They're both very clear.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
As this was going
on, they started--

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
this process was known that
the Earth would ultimately

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:84%
come to a point
where it would settle

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
into a third
dimensional frequency

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
range with all of its
occupants, animals, flora, fauna

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:90%
fully developed.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
There was-- it was
known among these beings

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
that there would come a point
in time where they had to stop

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:90%
this traversing back and forth.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.979 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was
just simple vibration.

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So it's almost like
they were coming and spying

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.434 align:middle line:84%
on it trying to enjoy
the show, but saying,

00:14:15.434 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:90%
hey, no more free admission.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:90%
You have to now participate.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, they were
blending with the show.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.645 align:middle line:84%
They were-- I have
remembrances from Lemuria.

00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We blended with
things back then.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.604 align:middle line:84%
You could blend with
inanimate objects.

00:14:28.604 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You could blend with a tree.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You could blend with a bird.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I used to fly around in birds.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was, again,
being supremely logical when

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:84%
these things came
up, I would think

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I was making these things
up, and they'd say, oh,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.594 align:middle line:90%
let me show you a tape here.

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Someone else having the
exact same experience.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.218 align:middle line:84%
So I started learning
over time there was

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:90%
a lot of validation for this.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if it sounds a
little wild, it's not.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.089 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have experienced it.

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So they were coming and they
were merging nonphysically

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
with a tree or
whatever it is just

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
for the pleasure of
feeling physicality.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But what was known was that
there would come a time when

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
this wouldn't be possible
because if they kept traversing

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
over here, their frequencies
would ultimately over time

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
become lower and lower just to
blend with this environment.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And they would--

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Their consciousness
is of a higher,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:90%
a much higher dimension.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: They would not able.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't by judgment.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
They would not be
able to traverse back

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
into their home environment.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to
make a decision.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Keep playing the game--

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
for some they played it
knowing the time had come.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, I could
compare it, for example,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.318 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to go scuba diving
and you say, OK, well, I'm

00:15:32.318 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:90%
going to put an oxygen tank on.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.988 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go scuba diving.

00:15:34.988 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
go to truly deep,

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.742 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to great depths
miles deep into the ocean,

00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:84%
you have to basically
take on a whole new body.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: You do.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because you have
to breathe like a fish.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.514 align:middle line:84%
You can no longer keep
your oxygen tank on.

00:15:45.514 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not going be able
to carry enough oxygen.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Do it
at your own peril.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what we did.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: That's what they did.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Some chose to stay.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Some were already stuck.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And the problem came not
with those who chose to stay.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:90%
That was a choice.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.882 align:middle line:84%
It came with those who had
already overstayed their time

00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and their frequencies
were damaged,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:90%
and did not want to stay.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Now they're in
physical reality here,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
means of expression

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.922 align:middle line:90%
as nonphysical beings.

00:16:12.922 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: These are the fallen?

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the essence
of the fallen angels?

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: No,
they weren't fallen.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:90%
It was just like you or me.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
We just didn't
listen to the alert.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Run, the water's
coming, you know?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I think it's going to be OK.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They just stuck around
too long and then

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
did not have the
capability to merge back

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:90%
into their original home field.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.732 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Then where did the
mythology of these demons

00:16:35.732 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:90%
come from, essentially?

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Every culture speaks of
the ones that are basically

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.679 align:middle line:84%
of a lower energy
density frequency

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that are more manipulative,
that are darker forces that

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
are looking to basically
use mankind either

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
as leeches, as
parasites to attach to,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:90%
to experience through.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Where does that
energy come from?

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.376 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, you've got
a confluence of events there.

00:16:58.376 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there are
beings from many dimensions

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that express themselves
here on this planet.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are not in
physical form, but we feel them.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.890 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel the darkness.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel these dense
pulls, this mass movement

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
toward something dark.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Those lower realms are
here for a purpose.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
They're just looking
to do what they do.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity for the human
is to distinguish the difference

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and make the choices
between interfacing

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
with that realm of
energy and those beings

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
versus the opposite, because we
have amazingly beautiful beings

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.784 align:middle line:90%
here to lift us as well.

00:17:34.784 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Because of what
happened with the human,

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
they became very
easy to exploit.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.107 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes.

00:17:40.107 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: We lost
our consciousness.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.415 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Only a few
had the consciousness,

00:17:44.415 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
a few that chose to stay,
and the rest, wiped.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Now they're in a body.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They're in a physical, fleshy
body that's going to die.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
They have no means of
contending with this.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.205 align:middle line:84%
And so, precisely, they
lost the tools, basically,

00:17:58.205 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:90%
of keeping that connection.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: They lost
all their memory.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
The longer it went on,
the more they incarnated,

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the further away they
were from whatever memory

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
they had of their home place
and their capabilities.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So speaking of this
idea that lower entities,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
demonic entities attaching
parasitically to humans,

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:15.925 align:middle line:84%
Alex Jones went
on a show recently

00:18:15.925 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and he said that based on his
research and conversations,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
he said there are beings
from lower dimensions that

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
are basically working to use
human energy to essentially

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.755 align:middle line:90%
hijack us to raise themselves.

00:18:26.755 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And they also,
ultimately, working

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to create a breakaway
species, which

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
may be the cybernetics
concept of more

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
robotic, transhuman concept
that essentially, that's

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.689 align:middle line:84%
the demonic forces trying to
find a new body, basically,

00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:90%
to experience and live through.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Doesn't
it make perfect sense?

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
If you limit the human
understanding to the fact

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that you're meat
and maybe something

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.501 align:middle line:84%
transcends that when
you die-- maybe not.

00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You won't know big surprise
till you get there, right?

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
If you can inculcate that
thought into society, then

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
society is very controllable.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have no
understanding of the soul

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
complex, the transcendent
quality of what you actually

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
are, then wouldn't you
be very tempted to buy

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.829 align:middle line:90%
into transhumanism?

00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
you have to have

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
another silicone-based
vehicle in order

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to continue your experience
in this plane or any other,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to
buy into it because you

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
have a fear of death.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
You have a fear of
your own mortality.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.838 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But we can actually
carry our consciousness forward

00:19:22.838 --> 00:19:23.712 align:middle line:90%
if we die properly.

00:19:23.712 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's
what I'm saying.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all naturally laid out.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful as it is.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to live in the same
body for 1,000 or 2,000 years?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Although we used to.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.589 align:middle line:84%
In old times, very,
very ancient times,

00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies were different.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
People lived very
long time spans.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.589 align:middle line:90%
But time passed differently.

00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
As it is right now, with
everything going on right now,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
this year 2017, would
you like to live

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years in the same body?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe try something new?

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.023 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I'm all about
cashing it in and trying

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%
another one, you know?

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:90%
When the time comes.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But there are those who
would say that it gets tiring,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that there is, frankly, there
is a feeling of redundancy

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:90%
to the human journey.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is the
purpose of being here?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Are we ultimately
going to find, to be

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
able to have an opportunity
to reconnect to our higher

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:90%
selves and our higher purpose?

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to have to
just keep repeating it over

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.055 align:middle line:90%
like Groundhog Day?

00:20:13.055 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: We are repeating
it like Groundhog Day.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been doing it for many,
many, many thousands of years,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:90%
millions of years.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we're doing now.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
does a person choose--

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having done
this kind of work

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing
for so many years,

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and then many years before
that, I've kind of come,

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I've come to a place
of understanding,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
which is look at the
dark forces all you want.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Study it.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.496 align:middle line:84%
If it makes you feel like you're
in the know and you somehow can

00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:90%
contend with life better, cool.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of men, especially
younger men, conspiracy, boom,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
takes them right
into it, and you

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.416 align:middle line:84%
start evaluating humanity
and our reality differently.

00:20:53.416 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But once you have a
grip on it and say,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
ew, those kind of creepy beings
who are just doing what they do

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:90%
have had their effect.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to choose
to live in that?

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you think
about it, the more you research,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the more you go
into it, the more

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:90%
you resonate with that force.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yes

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Or do
I want to go back

00:21:12.248 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:84%
into the capabilities
of my own being

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and maybe lift myself
out of this matrix?

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
That's the opportunity
for everyone.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But not until, you
know, the classic know

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
thy self comes true,
which takes a decision

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and it takes some effort on
our part to start listening.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fine process
of just listening

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to the subtle voice, which
is happening many times a day

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.264 align:middle line:90%
all day long.

00:21:34.264 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If you start listening
and following it,

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you start becoming in tune and
start speaking more clearly

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's where intuition
comes in, right?

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
follow that, you

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
start seeing you're
given even more and more,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and life starts looking like,
wow, they have a magical life.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:90%
They're just listening.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.781 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: There's a lot of
paths to go on because frankly

00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
the question is,
with the aliens--

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:90%
many people experience aliens.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And are these also
physical beings?

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.324 align:middle line:84%
So they also have
the same issues

00:22:00.324 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:90%
that humans do in the sense?

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.656 align:middle line:84%
They could be tricksters,
they could be lying to us,

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
they could be conveying
misconceptions

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.892 align:middle line:90%
about the universe to us?

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.447 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So that's the question
is, how do we basically--

00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is it through our intuition
that we can figure out

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
which entities are
basically attached

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.506 align:middle line:84%
to us, that are
parasitic, or that

00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:84%
are just trying to
keep us in a loop,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to those
that are actually

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
helping us free ourselves?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: There is only
one path in my opinion,

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.856 align:middle line:90%
and it's going vertical.

00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Once we go into that
part of ourselves,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:90%
you really can't be lied to.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.842 align:middle line:90%
You can discern truth instantly.

00:22:31.842 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You know which path to
follow in terms of where

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.355 align:middle line:90%
to place your energies.

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And then where you
place your energies,

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:90%
as you know, this world--

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
some people, Tom Campbell
calls it a collectively

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:90%
rendered reality.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
If enough people are
doing that and following

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the higher and more creative,
more divine part of their path,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
what does that collective
reality start looking like?

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.482 align:middle line:84%
So look at all the
disrupters in our world.

00:22:56.482 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
You and I have
interviewed enough people.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
We already know,
every institution

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:90%
is a disrupter, right?

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people in it are
doing it for the right reasons.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Some are doing it for
positions of control.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter if
we're talking about media.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.375 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
for talking out

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:11.816 align:middle line:90%
economics, finance, politics.

00:23:11.816 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Manipulators.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.731 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Manipulators.

00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:90%
The manipulators.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We can either react to that,
freak out, draw more drama

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves, and go on
a downward spiral, which

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are
doing right now.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Or we can say, aha, I see
what this opportunity is.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
This is really the great cluster
f of them all right now, right?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And we can respond
in a different way.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So speaking of that,
I see the situation currently

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and I say, if people predict
the new age is coming

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
as one more of unity,
of transcending

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
the polarized
conception of reality,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
the binary systems of left,
right, Democrat, Republican,

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:84%
female, male, it's like
a lot of opposition

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:90%
in terms of these concepts.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We're also moving towards a
more unified consciousness

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
holistic nature of things.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I see what's taking place
as basically a test,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the final test
where everything is

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
polarizing so dramatically that
you can't really escape it.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.827 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ultimately
transcend those polarities.

00:24:06.827 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
we're going through.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:90%
So I pose it to you.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
posed from Eva

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
in Estonia has
asked this question.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Is 2017 going to
be a special year?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that speaks into
this overall question of what

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:90%
we're going to through.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.473 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I think
it's a very special year

00:24:21.473 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
in that astrologically it's a
year of tension and revolution.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And these years have
happened in times past.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But somehow the stakes
seem to be a lot higher.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a lot
more energy behind it.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:84%
People are angrier than ever,
more disappointed than ever.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look at
it over a period of time.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
If we look back to the
Bush era when all of this

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
really kind of, the
dark agenda really

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.822 align:middle line:84%
started exerting itself
fully once again.

00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It crystallized
around 9/11 forward almost,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.574 align:middle line:90%
or even 2000 forward.

00:24:51.574 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to really clarify.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
That gave us an opportunity
to make choices.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
As a culture, we
voted for Obama who

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
was representing something
different, something better.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Hope, change.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, Obama was destined
to fail, and he did.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.945 align:middle line:90%
He failed.

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Good man in some ways but in--

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:84%
everyone's a good man
in certain ways, right?

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
We all have this
duality within us.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:90%
But the reality is, he failed.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Left people so disheartened
that they would do anything.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You just start lashing
out to create change.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And politically, we
knew that we didn't have

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.374 align:middle line:90%
any good choices in the end.

00:25:28.374 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We knew that one meant
the same old, same old.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Just this stayed,
rotting condition.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.645 align:middle line:84%
And the other meant we don't
know what's going to happen.

00:25:34.645 --> 00:25:35.561 align:middle line:90%
Throw a grenade in it.

00:25:35.561 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And people voted for
that for a reason.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
This internal thing
in them is really,

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
deeply desiring a
catalytic event for change.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Even if it's chaos.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Even if it's chaos.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll do anything to shake it
up and start growing again.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
We stopped growing.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And it's essentially
a necessary chaos.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.265 align:middle line:84%
It's a chaos that's going
to basically catalyze us.

00:25:53.265 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
we are entering

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
a more multidimensional
understanding of our existence?

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Is that what this new age is
supposed to really be about?

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
I would offer this.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going into
deeper polarization.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
going into a period

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
where those who have
nuanced minds, those who

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
have good hearts and
they're willing to roll up

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:84%
their sleeves a bit, do a
little work on themselves

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to go into a much
more integrated level of being

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:84%
with true self, with all
the dimensions of our being.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I do think that
that is happening.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And we can see it even in
little children being born.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It is happening.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.352 align:middle line:84%
But then look to the
rest of the world

00:26:32.352 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's going the opposite
way because they've

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
gotten sucked into
that downward spiraling

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:90%
vortex of drama and fear.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to have both.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
different worlds.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We might be residing
on the same planet.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are completely
different realities.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, I feel like, I
feel a fracturing of reality

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: It's
epitomized, for example,

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
by the internet in
a sense of you're

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
getting the feedback, a feedback
mechanism of showing you

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
kind of the perspective that you
have, the world you want to see

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
is coming through
clearly in that sense.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps it represents
the fact that each of us

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.144 align:middle line:90%
has to focus within, right?

00:27:10.144 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: There is
nowhere else to go.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:90%
I call it our final frontier.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We keep thinking that space
is the final frontier.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
We've all been there.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Those guys are here, too.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Whoop-de-do.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.004 align:middle line:84%
But what is that doing
for you personally

00:27:24.004 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
to be aware that there are
beings from other planets here?

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And they have been here
from the beginning.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:90%
This isn't anything new.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're reptilian,
whether they're offshoot gray,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
creations, or whether
they're the most sublime type

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of beings, they've all been
here from the beginning.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They also came to
help in the beginning

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
when we had this
lack of integration.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even know how
to procreate back then.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine this blissful,
angelic being stuffed

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
into this reality physically?

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.465 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was
a lot of confusion.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And the beings did come to help.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.419 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I think we're at
that level all over again.

00:28:00.419 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: We're at
that level over again,

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
being exploited and
being helped if we wish.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so do you think that
we're going to see in any sense

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.722 align:middle line:84%
more involvement
from these beings?

00:28:13.722 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Many people, obviously, are--

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.055 align:middle line:84%
I think more people are
awake looking to the stars,

00:28:17.055 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
looking to aliens to
reassure us and say, look,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:90%
you're not alone here.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.247 align:middle line:84%
Do you expect that
that might be coming?

00:28:23.247 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It will.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
remember, any beings

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.457 align:middle line:84%
that come here telling us they
are the way, they know the way,

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're taking
us there are false.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And
that's a lot of beings

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that can be sound-- they
can sound like angels even.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:90%
They're not the way.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Any respectful being
understands we already are that.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
We need to have the interference
blocked so that we cannot be

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
interfered with as
deeply as we are.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
block it, right?

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And we need to develop
our sensitivity

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.470 align:middle line:84%
enough to be able to reach
in and listen to those

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:90%
who are here to help us.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And they would never
claim to be the way.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Those beings never
would do that.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And how do you think
that the work you're doing,

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.755 align:middle line:84%
the teachings you're
doing are helping people

00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:04.436 align:middle line:84%
to get back within that
centered self of, you know,

00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
tapping into their
own intuition?

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: That's a
really good question.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It is very complex, and
it's a confused answer

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:90%
that I'll give you.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this for so long
and was at the very beginning

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:84%
base of media and
conspiracy and all

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that, which that was
part of my own journey

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
is that shock and
awe of realizing,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, we have been
lied to across the board.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I had to find out myself.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went through those periods
of, kind of takes you down

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
into anger and
then helplessness.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:84%
But I pretty much bounced
up quickly from it.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's where I
was in the media.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm still doing
conspiracy stuff.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: True.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.576 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So
what I try to do is

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
look at common threads,
these little golden threads

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
within the conspiracy
and say, aha.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is our opportunity?

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a word being
said here that's actually

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
an entree to a much
higher understanding

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and greater empowerment for us?

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I try to take every
show I do and bring it

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:84%
into that realm of
possibility, even

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.907 align:middle line:84%
if it's a statement
that may sound

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:84%
like a throwaway at the
end of the show, it's not.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just the first time
I really could get around

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:90%
to it in that show.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't like putting out the
dark and the conspiratorial

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN: It's not about vibrating
at that same level of anger,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:10%
fear

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: I don't
vibrate at that level.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of OK,
recognizing it and transmuting

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Yet I know a lot in that
area and I'm skilled in it.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:10%
So I'll probably be called
upon to continue doing that.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:10%
But again, if we can
take that and say, aha.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:10%
See this little hole
in the story here?

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
This is where we come in.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And don't let these people--
this is one thing that

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.520 align:middle line:90%
is misunderstood.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
People tend to give
their power away

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.020 align:middle line:84%
to anything that seems to
have more sophistication,

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's technologically,
whether they can use their eyes

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and their mind to stun
you, get inside you in case

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.190 align:middle line:90%
of abductees, and so forth.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is,
the sublime nature

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.090 align:middle line:84%
of what a human being is, none
of these species come close to.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.157 align:middle line:84%
They're very undeveloped
in those ways.

00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that takes us there

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible sense of
compassion, love or no reason

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:84%
at all, just the
ability to merge

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
with something
beautiful or an emotion

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:90%
or a person in a beautiful way.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
These species don't
have these capabilities.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:84%
If we focus on those little
moments, those are our in point

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.256 align:middle line:90%
back to the soul.

00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Unconditional love.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.671 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Unconditional love.

00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:28.297 align:middle line:84%
And then we transcend
out of this game.

00:31:28.297 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
This three dimensional
reality is just

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.290 align:middle line:90%
a place to learn for a while.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.172 align:middle line:84%
We transcend back
into our truer state.

00:31:34.172 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Then we can choose
what kind of adventure

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:90%
we want to go on from there.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Groundhog's Day is starting
to feel pretty boring here.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: At the end of the
day, we can't take any of it

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.950 align:middle line:90%
too seriously.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:46.366 align:middle line:84%
Keep that sense of humor in
the sense that, like you said,

00:31:46.366 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
it's all just play, experiment,
suffering, but also joy.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And we will be out
of it eventually.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.848 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Absolutely.

00:31:53.848 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all an
opportunity to learn.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.647 align:middle line:84%
It's all an
opportunity, no matter

00:31:56.647 --> 00:31:58.479 align:middle line:84%
how painful it gets,
to keep the heart open.

00:31:58.479 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.578 align:middle line:84%
When the heart starts getting
crusty and closing down

00:32:01.578 --> 00:32:03.660 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
stresses, you're

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
losing your own game there.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:90%
At least until it changes.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Beautifully put.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: It's been fun.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.322 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:32:12.322 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it, folks.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating insights
from Regina Meredith.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:10%
today, so I urge you to check
out her show on Gaia, "Open

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:10%
Minds," for more of her work
and to keep on studying.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
It requires constant
reassessment.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.
