>> Who wrote the Gospels?

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Was Jesus really Caesar?

Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:18.951 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:10%
And joining me today
is Joseph Atwill,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
who has studied extensively
the origins of Christianity,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
including the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Atwill's books include
"Caesar's Messiah: The Roman

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:10%
of Conspiracy to Invent Jesus."

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:10%
It has become the basis for
a fascinating documentary.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And today we discuss
his fresh perspective

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
on Christianity and
government control structures.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start
by asking, obviously,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
about your main theory or
thesis of "Caesar's Messiah,"

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is the idea that
the Roman court actually,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:90%
essentially, wrote the Gospels.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.486 align:middle line:10%
And even though it's an
idea that a lot of people

00:01:01.486 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:10%
have hard time getting
their head around,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:10%
it's very, very logical.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, at
this point in history,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Rome was engaged was a
Messianic movement in Judea

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and a war that lasted
over 100 years.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And so Christianity
basically was a response

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to the literature
and the religion that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:90%
was promoting this rebellion.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.692 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to start by
just asking how you were led

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
in your own
discoveries, obviously.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
What led-- yeah, what led you
into this-- to this conclusion?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had studied the
Gospels in my childhood,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I attended a Jesuit
school in Japan,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of indoctrination
and study of the Bible.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.732 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always
curious about it.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though I kind fell away
from the faith as I got older,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I retained the interest.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the Dead Sea Scrolls
sort of became popularized,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I began studying them.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed that there
was a militarized messiah.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And this made perfect
sense historically,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because the son of
David, you would expect

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to be a military warrior.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to question
the character in the Gospels.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to learn
more about the history

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.131 align:middle line:84%
of this era that had
produced, purportedly,

00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:90%
the character of Jesus Christ.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to study
the only real historian

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.382 align:middle line:90%
of the era, Josephus.

00:02:21.382 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
He was the only one
who was on the ground

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
during this period who wrote
history we can look at.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I began
to study it, I saw

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that there were very strange
parallels between events

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that he would
describe and events

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.417 align:middle line:90%
that appeared in the Gospels.

00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that
was all I was studying,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
was just the
relationship between what

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I saw as these parallels between
the Gospels and Josephus.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And then one day it occurred to
me-- they're all in sequence.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
All of these parallels
are occurring

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:90%
in this vast sequence.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew I was
dealing with more than just

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a lampoon of a
military victory that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:90%
found its way into the gospel.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was dealing with,
like, an overall genre.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I started studying
the Gospels as a genre.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I eventually
was able to realize

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that the history of the war
with the Messianic movement that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:84%
was written by Flavius
Josephus was actually

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
the typologic link
to the Gospels,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
so that all of the events
that Jesus was experiencing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and predicting would actually
occur during the war.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And this was done as
a kind of legacy piece

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
for the Caesars, who
produced the Gospels.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to record the
fact that this new version

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
of Judaism that
they were creating

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
had this relationship to
their military victories.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the
victors write history.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
With the Gospels,
this was the case,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
except it was written
as prophecy rather than

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%
after the fact.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.254 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea is that
there was no Jesus figure.

00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've heard you
mention Josephus, obviously.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
He mentions Jesus,
the brother of James.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So are there any other
reports that would have been

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
relative to that time
period that have anything,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
have any reference to Jesus
as an historical figure beyond

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Josephus?

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Josephus was the only
individual in the first century

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
that actually was writing
about the character Jesus

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Christ that has any
connection to history,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
other than the Gospels.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Tacitus, Suetonius-- they wrote
about this after the fact.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They were writing material about
the character of Jesus Christ.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But once you're able to place
the Gospels inside the Flavian

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
court, once you can show,
just point by point--

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and in my book, I don't
present conjecture I actually

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
simply lay out the documents.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I lay out the Gospels, and
I lay right next to them

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:90%
the text from Josephus.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a different
quality of evidence.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And once a reader goes through
that, they can see that,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
well, in fact, the
character Jesus Christ

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
is completely artificial.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is that those
historians, Tacitus, Suetonius,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.664 align:middle line:84%
and Josephus himself-- you
know, the question is, well,

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
where do they get
this information

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
about this strange
character Jesus Christ?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we can
answer it completely.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
It came from the
fictional history,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
basically, that the
Flavian court was creating.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there have been a
lot of allegations about Jesus

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
being, obviously, a very
clear parallel to previous

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
mythologies, things like
Osiris and Horus from Egypt,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
or Addis in the
Middle East, Dionysus.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Even in Rome, they
had Mithraism.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So what was it about
this mythology,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.882 align:middle line:84%
this Jesus being a Jewish
messiah figure, that would--

00:05:38.882 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:84%
what would motivate the
Romans to actually want

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.482 align:middle line:84%
to create this mythology
around him, drawing

00:05:43.482 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
upon a lot of these
other, it would seem,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
these other mythological
figures as a model?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
know, all of those gods

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
are basically Roman gods.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the thought world
of the authors of the Gospels.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why many people see
reflections of those deities

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.046 align:middle line:90%
in the story of Jesus.

00:06:05.046 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the Romans
wanted specifically

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
to create a Jewish
character is because this

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
was the problem that Rome was
experiencing at this time.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
They waged a war
that lasted over

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
100 years with a
Messianic movement,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
a movement that was
inspired by its literature,

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
by the historical and
reported historical stories

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of a messiah.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And so Rome wanted to create
a messiah that was Romanized,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that would turn the other cheek,
that would give to Caesar what

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:90%
is Caesar's.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why they
created the Gospels.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
They created the Gospels
simply as a version of Judaism

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that could exist inside
of the Roman Empire

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and would not promote rebellion.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Rome was facing a
problem, which was

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that the Zealots in Judea
that were waging the rebellion

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
were attempting to expand
the rebellion to the Jews

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Roman Empire.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Jews were dispersed
throughout the Roman Empire.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
They were perhaps as much as
10% of the entire population.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And so Rome was
very worried about

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:90%
the missionary activities.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this was really the
purpose of the character Jesus

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Christ, was basically to stop
the missionary activities

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Zealots.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They would have their literature
with a particular version

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
of a militarized Christ.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But in between that individual,
that militarized Christ,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:90%
would come Jesus Christ.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
He would be the one that would
be supported by the empire.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
But he is seen, I think,
by a lot of people

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
to be a revolutionary.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
He's basically throwing the
moneylenders out of the temple,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Now isn't that-- basically,
the moneylenders,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.295 align:middle line:84%
aren't they actually working
under Roman rulership

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:90%
and collecting money?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus is seen
as a revolutionary

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
because he--
basically because he

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
rebels from the authority
of Jewish leaders.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the Pharisees
and the Sadducees

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:90%
are given a hard time by Jesus.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
The moneylender story is
actually about thieves.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.077 align:middle line:90%
This is how he calls them.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you have
to go into the typology

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.245 align:middle line:84%
to understand what the
story in the Gospel

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
is actually relating to.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
If you work through
the Gospels compared

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to the history of
Josephus, you'll

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
see that at the point that Jesus
throws the moneylenders out,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
this is the point that
Titus Flavius comes

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
into the exact physical area and
throws out those who had stolen

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:90%
things from the temple.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
So he's drives the thieves out.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is not a revolutionary
figure in the sense

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that he did not promote
the rebellion that

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:90%
was in existence at that time.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
He didn't take a stand
against the Roman Empire.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was
very much someone

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
who was advocating his
followers to get along

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:90%
with the Roman Empire.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
He stated that you
should go the extra mile

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:90%
when you're conscripted.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
statements in the Gospels.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
What that's referring to is
that a subject of the empire

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
could be forced to carry a
Roman soldier's backpack for one

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
mile.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And this was why
they had milestones

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
throughout the highway.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:84%
What Jesus is
saying is don't just

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:90%
cooperate with the Roman army.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Go the extra mile.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
So, no.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
He is seen as a revolutionary
character, but he is not.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, he is
supporting the forces

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to fight
against the rebellion.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.245 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's very clear
that Pontius Pilate, who

00:09:35.245 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
is the only Roman
agent in the story,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
is actually very clear
to wash his hands of it

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and basically say, OK,
know we're turning it

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
over to the Jews.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the Jews,
the Sadducees and Pharisees,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
you're responsible
for this man's blood.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very clear
indictment in that regard.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
He says-- what Jesus
says is that-- well,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and the Jews are
claimed to have said

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that his blood will
be on our hands

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and on our children's hands.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a vicious
piece of anti-Semitism.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it had
historical power.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously untrue.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just think about
the logic of the statement,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
just shows, well,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
who benefits from this
bizarre perspective?

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's Rome.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Rome.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.079 align:middle line:84%
>> So is there any tradition
of Roman god-building?

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes,
empires-- historically,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.536 align:middle line:84%
I can think of, for
example, the Persian

00:10:28.536 --> 00:10:30.735 align:middle line:84%
Empire having their
Temple of Apollo,

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
for example, even though it
was a Greek Temple of Apollo.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a place where they would
collect taxes from the Greeks,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.396 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:36.396 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.068 align:middle line:84%
>> So is there a tradition
in Rome of that kind

00:10:39.068 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of god-building?

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there were so many gods
that basically every single day

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of the year had one that
was given sacrifice to.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The Caesars realized that there
was tremendous political power

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in being gods themselves.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the largest
bureaucracy at this time

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
was the imperial cult, tens
of thousands of priests.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And they all administered to
the idea that Caesar was God.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of god
building, absolutely,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
god building was going on.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was the individual Caesar
who was alive at that time.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He would be building
up the case that he

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
would be basically able to
be deified after his death.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
There were-- at the time
of Suetonius's writing

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
"The Twelve Caesar's there had
already been five Caesars that

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
had been deified.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So the character in the Gospels,
that is the most significant.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And the one that is really
the hardest for people

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.792 align:middle line:84%
who hear my theory
to understand is

00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that there is a character
called the Son of Man

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus projects
will come in the future.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And he gives an exact
time, or at least he

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
gives exact events
that will occur.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
He says that the Galilean
towns will be crushed.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem will be
encircled with a wall.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
The Temple will be raised.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And the abomination of
desolation that Daniel predicts

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
will come to pass.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are all
military victories

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Flavians, each
one of those things.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Son of Man
that Jesus predicted

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
didn't show up, if
people think it was him.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Jesus did not come
during that period.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
record of Jesus Christ.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.314 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, that
would have been noticed.

00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus Christ
did not come back,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:90%
so who is it referring to?

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Roman court
historians flatly

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
maintained that the Jewish
Christ, that all the prophecies

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that people think foresaw
Jesus were actually

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
about the Flavian Caesar.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So you see, there's a
perfect logical construction

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
between the Gospels, Jesus
saying the Son of Man

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
during the Roman war,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and the Caesar, then, in
the imperial cult saying,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I am the Jewish Christ.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:90%
So the Son of Man is Caesar.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting,
because ultimately,

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that Caesar because, in
a form, the new pope,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
the Pontifex Maximus.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And so in a way, you know the
Holy Roman Empire was the Roman

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Empire continued, made holy,
so the transformation by this

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Christian religion to perpetuate
the Roman Empire to the present

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just preposterous.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.946 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tragedy of
history that this really

00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:90%
hasn't become common knowledge.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Look, the pope has, as his
official title, the Pontiff

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Maximus.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
That title was an official
title of the Roman Caesar.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It meant the head of the
Roman College of Priests.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a title that the Caesar
held during that entire era.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Where the Vatican
exists today was

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the site of imperial
buildings and structures.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the Holy Roman Church,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing is
the empire of the Caesars

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that has changed
the name of Caesar,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and changed the
name of the building

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that he lives in, but
kept the power, you see?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Because there is really
no discontinuation

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
from the power of the Caesar and
then the power of the Pontiff

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Maximus as you enter
into the feudal system.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's this one long trajectory
that goes for 1,500 years,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
until you have the Renaissance.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
The public were
fooled into believing

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.585 align:middle line:84%
that there was a new
political reign, basically,

00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
a religious one that was
headed by the Pontiff Maximus.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't the case.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It was always just
Caesar by another name.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.299 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just
mentioned how Jesus

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
was said to have predicted
all these events that occur,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.215 align:middle line:84%
including the
destruction of Jerusalem.

00:14:31.215 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, it makes much more
sense if this was all written

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:90%
in the Gospel after the fact.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So of course, such words
could be ascribed to Jesus,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
because it's occurred already.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But yet we do have certain
historians, like Tacitus,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
who refer to the Christians
burning Rome, for example,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in 64 AD, being responsible
for the great fire.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So what are we to make
of these allegations

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that Christians existed before
the so-called construction

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Gospels, after this war?

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are very lucky
that we have the typology

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Gospels and
it's now decoded,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.167 align:middle line:84%
because we have a really
clear answer for that.

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is a question, I
think, that has confused

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Christians for two millenniums.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad we're
able to answer it now.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The Romans had a
stroke of genius

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
when they named the
religion Christianity.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Because basically, they
took over, semantically,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
the concept of what it
is to be a Christian.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.989 align:middle line:84%
The fact is there was another
movement, a real Christianity,

00:15:27.989 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
a Christianity that sprang
from the Jewish people

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
that was rebelling inside
of Judea from Roman

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
colonialization at this time.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But when the Romans named
their organization Christians,

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
they basically took
on some of the history

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
of the real
Christianity in order

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to fool people in the future,
to blur the histories.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the Gospels,
at the conclusion,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
we have Jesus predicting
to Simon and John

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that Simon will be taken
where he doesn't want to go,

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
bound, and given a
death to glorify God,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and that the other disciple,
John, will be given, basically,

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:90%
kind of a pass on this.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:90%
He will not be executed.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
This concludes the
Gospel, John 21.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
conclusion of the Roman war

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that is the basis
for the Gospel,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Simon and John are captured.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
They're brought,
basically, to a tribunal.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Simon is given the
sentence of execution.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
He's told he's
going to be bound,

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:84%
taken where he doesn't
want to go, which is Rome,

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:90%
and executed.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
John is going to be
given life imprisonment.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have this--
what Jesus predicted,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:90%
the historian Josephus recorded.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
The two are completely
wired together.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But what this shows
us is that what

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
we have as the history
of Christianity

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, in many
cases, the history

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:90%
of the real Zealot movement.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
Tacitus recording

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that the Christians
of the Roman type

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
may have been responsible
for the fire in 64,

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:84%
now this is not even
plausible as propaganda.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all,
these are supposed

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to be pacifistic Christians,
turning the other cheek.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be the
ones to burn Rome?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the real
Zealot Christians

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, rebelling from
Rome at that very moment.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is the group
that actually--

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
if the Christians were
involved in the fire at all.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Because remember that Tacitus
is basically ascribing

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
bad leadership to Nero.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have to bear
in mind that Tacitus

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is from the Flavian Court
the Flavians had a propaganda

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
problem, in that they
replaced the Julio-Claudians.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The Julio-Claudians had
been Caesars and the living

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
God for over 100 years.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So when the Flavians deposed
them, they had a PR problem.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when you look
at this slurring of Nero, which

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
occurs in the passage, you have
to think, well, wait a second,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
you've got the slurring of Nero
and this curious historical

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
ascription to the
"Christians" that we

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:90%
know the Flavians produced.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can now see that
this is just propaganda

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:90%
that the Flavians put out.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It gives a fake history for
this religious organization,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and it also slams Nero.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very convenient
piece of propaganda.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this time period
of 64-- really, the campaign

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
begins around 66-- but the
campaign against Judea, right?

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> A massive Roman
war against Judea.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.314 align:middle line:90%
>> But Rome had to respond.

00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:33.386 align:middle line:84%
But there had been-- if
you look at Josephus,

00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
the history of the
whole first century,

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
it had rebellion
after rebellion.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.515 align:middle line:84%
>> The war in 66 was special,
because they drove Rome out.

00:18:40.515 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was special,
because they established

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:90%
their own nation-state.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.372 align:middle line:84%
But there had been
rebellion after rebellion

00:18:46.372 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
after rebellion, throughout
the entire first century.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So the event in 64 that
Tacitus writes about

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
is-- I mean, just logically
was from that religious Zealot

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's this, obviously,
this Roman war that

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
also leads to tremendous
persecution and slaughter

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Jews, and you
know, the massacring

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
of them in Jerusalem--
basically first forcing the city

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.370 align:middle line:84%
into starvation, then burning
it down, exiling the Jews

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:90%
from Jerusalem.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine that
there would be, I would think,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
some Jewish literature
that would recognize

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
if these gospels were not true,
that would say, wait a minute,

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.917 align:middle line:90%
this is propaganda.

00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Has there been-- was there
no Jewish literature to say--

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, really good question.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, this Christian
movement is really not true.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Because there was no Jesus here.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I could imagine
something like that.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, why isn't there at
least some oral tradition about

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean the first
thing is Rome wiped out all

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
the literature.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was
actually a theory

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Jews of this era
had become illiterate.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Because until the Dead
Sea Scrolls were found,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
there hadn't been a single
scrap of Hebraic writing

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
from this era, not
a single scrap.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can see Rome
was very thorough.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, the written
documentation of the Roman

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Christianity was like every
other piece of paper that

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:90%
had Hebraic literature on it.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
It had been wiped out.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The oral traditions, some of
which may end up in the Talmud,

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
actually have some
possibly cryptic references

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:90%
to the character Jesus Christ.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into them, but
they're very derogatory.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
But the rabbinical
Judaism, which

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
was established following
the series of rebellion,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
from which you would have had an
oral tradition that might have

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
produced this kind of awareness
of a Roman-origin Christianity,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
well, unfortunately, Rome
also controlled that.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
foundational pieces, the Targum

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Mishnah, the people
who authored those documents

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:90%
were recorded and cited.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Onkelos, who
authored the Targum,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
he was the nephew
of Titus Flavius.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Meir, who authored
the Mishnah, well, he

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:90%
was the nephew of Nero.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
the academy at Yavne

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that then produced
rabbinical Judaism

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.275 align:middle line:90%
was very tightly controlled.

00:21:01.275 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had
imperial family members

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:90%
basically in charge of it.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:11.934 align:middle line:84%
So this, over that period of
time, then, created a vacuum.

00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you didn't have what
I think would have been,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:90%
kind of, at least a curiosity.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
However, when we start
talking about Shakespeare,

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see that,
in fact, many Jews were

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
aware of the real
origin of Christianity.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.721 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't really
bring it to the public,

00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
because this would
have been a death

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
sentence during the period
where the divine right of kings

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
was completely dependent upon
the veracity of the Gospels.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:90%
But they knew it.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And as I maintain, the
Shakespearean literature

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
shows that they were well
aware of the real origin.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But this was hundreds
of years after the fact.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it really raises
an interesting question,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
which is that if Christ was
a concocted figure by Rome,

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
why would the Holy Roman Empire
be so committed to the region

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem and that area,
obviously of the Middle East,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
as being so important that they
had these Crusades to conquer

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:90%
this region?

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately you
have Israel as potentially

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in the same basic
boundaries as what

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
was then a Crusader kingdom.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, to this
very day, we still

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.015 align:middle line:84%
see these religious
wars going on,

00:22:19.015 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:84%
whether between Jew
and Muslim or between

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:90%
various Christian faiths.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The point is that to
this day, this region

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is still a very hotly
contested and important region.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What would the Roman Empire,
the modern Holy Roman Empire,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the Catholic Church, care
so much for this region,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:90%
if it was just a concoction?

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the popes wanted
to reconquer it from Islam

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
because it basically brought
into question the divine

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%
provenance of the Gospels.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that was pretty much
what they were concerned about.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
always been a worry

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the
Vatican that people

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
won't take the story seriously.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they lost control
of the Holy Land, I mean,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
it was sort of a
natural thought.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, wait a second, why didn't
God help us to take it back?

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they had
crusade after crusade.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And the reason, I think, is just
because they had this concern.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
They've always had
a concern about

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the Gospels
were taken seriously.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm just thinking more
in terms of the geopolitical

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
conception, of how important
the Mediterranean has been,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
as a lake, for
shipping purposes.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously going
through the Dead Sea,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, and moving,
all the way, your ships

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
all around to the East, for
example, why that would be

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:90%
an important region to control.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I mean,
militarily, it's essential.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Because basically, it
would relate to Egypt,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:90%
which was Rome's bread basket.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
the Jewish rebellion

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.761 align:middle line:84%
was that Rome was basically
a prison of nations.

00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at the Roman
Empire, what it really was,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
it basically was a
prison of nations

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:90%
and ethnicities and religions.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Jews established
a nation-state inside the Roman

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Empire, they were
minting their own coins.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
They actually were
representing to the world

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that we are here to stay.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
This was the basis
of Rome's response

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:90%
to it, why it was so fierce.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And people really
don't understand--

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
it's not well-known,
and it should

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
be-- how ferocious the
war was between Rome

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.574 align:middle line:90%
and the Messianic movement.

00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Because there were three
different rebellions.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just
this one in 66, 73.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.292 align:middle line:84%
There was one in 115
called the Kitos Rebellion.

00:24:33.292 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
famous Bar Kokhba Rebellion,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
which led to the Diaspora
that you referred to earlier,

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:90%
in 135.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The Kitos Rebellion,
just to give you

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
an example of the ferocity,
as to the military reason

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
as to why they wanted
to control this region--

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
the Messianic movement
gained control

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:90%
over the island of Cyprus.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And they genocided
all 240,000 Gentiles.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
That's recorded by
Roman historians.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
They then gained
complete control

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
over Cyrenaica, which is now
Libya, a very important colony

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:90%
of Rome.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:84%
They drove Rome
out of Alexandria,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.400 align:middle line:84%
which was the
headwaters of the Nile,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.692 align:middle line:84%
where all of their
grain production

00:25:16.692 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:90%
was basically coming through.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
80% of the grain,
according to some reports,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
were coming right
through the Nile.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually letters
found of the Roman magistrates

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
fleeing down the Nile away
from the Messianic movement.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So even though the
Roman history doesn't

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
record how existential this
threat was, it is a fact.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you have-- when the
Bar Kokhba Rebellion occurred,

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
now in order to basically
control these rebellions,

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
Diaspora came from.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It was the idea that by
taking away the land,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
they were hoping the religion
would then quiet down.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So now when you look at the
Crusades, this is the context.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the
Vatican doesn't forget.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It has a long memory.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It wants to control
the region, I think,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
because it knew that
ultimately, it could become

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
a source of rebellion again.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:12.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:26:12.866 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, we're
looking at Christianity

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
as something that was a
co-opting of, as you say,

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
the Messianic Zealot zealotry
of the Jewish faith that

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.272 align:middle line:84%
was opposing this Roman
imperial politics.

00:26:24.272 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But towards that end, there
were also many real spiritual

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and mythical traditions that
were obviously put together

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in a hodgepodge fashion
into this new religion.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But you also talk about
the second coming of Christ.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.716 align:middle line:84%
And you, in your book, say
that that has already occurred.

00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.405 align:middle line:90%
How does that fit in?

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, again, it's just
a very important concept.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Jesus has a character
that is greater than him.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And he actually talks
about the great power

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that this individual have.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
He gives the point in time
when the individual comes.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be during the
Roman war with the Jews.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And he predicts his coming.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, Christians
have seen this as the claim

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that there will be a
second coming of Christ,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that he'll come
back to the planet.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this
is Roman humor.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:84%
This is not a serious
religious position.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It is completely
transparent, when

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says this generation
will not pass away, that he's

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
referring to the Roman war.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:90%
A generation was 40 years.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Now just-- this is something
that any one of the people who

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
listen to this can do.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:90%
This is so simple to do.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Jesus dies in 33 CE,
if you figure out

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
using the details
that the Gospel gives.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:90%
He dies on Passover 33.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the Passover
lamb of the new covenant.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The term New Testament
actually means new covenant.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It's replacing the old covenant.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
The old covenant had
a Passover sacrifice.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Jesus now becomes the
new Passover sacrifice.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The old covenant
had a 40-year period

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of wandering before you had
the Israelites able to gain

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
possession, a change
of ownership of Israel.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Jesus then dies at Passover 33.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The Roman war concludes
on Passover 73.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect 40-year cycle for
the new Passover lamb leading

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
to the new date of
the new covenant

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and the new change in ownership.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the date that Rome
then owned all of this land,

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and now the new Judaism
owns the new Israel,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
which is, of course, all
control of Roman literature.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, look, this is fake.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is done
back-calculated.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
This is someone
who's, back in time,

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:84%
looking backwards, and
working it all out.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.301 align:middle line:84%
And now this is an
interesting thing,

00:28:44.301 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
because what this means
is all of our date,

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
our entire calendar
structure, actually

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
stems from the destruction
of the temple, 70.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because they take the
war and they make it

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
into what's called the
Daniel week, basically.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.740 align:middle line:90%
It would be a seven-year period.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So the war begins at this
date in 66, and it ends in 73.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's roughly these
seven-year periods.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the midpoint is the
destruction of Jerusalem.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And so our history, to
this day, doesn't actually

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.729 align:middle line:90%
stem from Jesus.

00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:16.270 align:middle line:84%
That's a fiction that these guys
came up with after the fact.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It stems from the destruction
of the city of Jerusalem.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to look at, again,
this notion of the creation

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of a mythology as a
religion, it would

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
appear that overall, the
Catholic Church is not

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the powerful instrument that it
once was over people's lives.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.573 align:middle line:84%
It maybe doesn't
have the same effect.

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are coming
into a new understanding.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Could you see, for
example, the potential

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of a new religion
forming, whether it

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
be from the new age or
some sort of merging

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:90%
of the various faiths?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Or could you imagine a
new conception of faith?

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the moment in time.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have been crushed
by the oligarchs, who

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:84%
have studied us and use
weaponized anthropology.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They keep these
structures of religion

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and financial
oppression in place.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:90%
We get nothing, basically.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:90%
War after war, right?

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Just crushed.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, now is the time.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Because finally there
is, with the internet,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
there is the capacity for
the common man and woman

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:90%
to exchange information.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And with the internet, there is
the capacity for fact-checking.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, we can help one
another defend ourselves

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
against the sophistry and
the weaponized anthropology.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And so when I say
that the people who

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:84%
are putting out the new
media, the alt media, man,

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:90%
they are doing God's work.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:84%
They are really,
really finally doing

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.520 align:middle line:84%
something that has a
real religious basis.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:84%
After 2000 years
of being crushed

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
under oligarchic sophistry,
we have a chance, now,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to use the internet to
communicate to one another

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and to gain some
real understanding

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of our political reality, of our
spiritual reality, of what life

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:90%
can be, you see?

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, I mean, I just
tell people, don't be shy.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to lose.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.609 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to last forever.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to use this opportunity
to get information out

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
about what has happened to
us, about how they control us.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:84%
There are researchers
now-- look at,

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.460 align:middle line:84%
for example, like MK Ultra,
that is now being exposed,

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:24.600 align:middle line:84%
the vast operation that it
had of weaponized anthropology

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:90%
against our people.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is now
something that's

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
being exchanged on a mass scale.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is the time.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are
really good at organizing

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
the mass media, selecting
guests, getting these ideas

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.932 align:middle line:90%
out-- so I'm not exaggerating.

00:31:39.932 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it might not be you,
but it'll be someone like you,

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.870 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps a whole group of
people, that will actually

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
be the leadership of what
can be, really, finally,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
an honest religious
context to our life,

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and an honest financial
context to our life.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I would call
it the assertion of our own

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:90%
self-sovereignty, right?

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great expression.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And recognizing
our own power.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that-- that's
actually the way to say it.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:90%
It potential.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
talking with me today.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, thank you, Sean.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.224 align:middle line:84%
Well, there you have it, folks,
some fascinating insights

00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:09.209 align:middle line:90%
from Joseph Atwill.

00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:11.500 align:middle line:84%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
but I do urge you to
check out his book,

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:84%
"Caesar's Messiah,"
which is packed

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:90%
with detailed information.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:90%
along the edge of the buzzsaw.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Sean Stone.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you are
the revolution.
