>>SEAN STONE: How do
we discover and unlock

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.540 align:middle line:90%
dormant codes in our DNA?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.064 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the Buzzsaw.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.546 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:22.455 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to Buzzsaw, where we
cut through the mainstream

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore the
twilight zones of reality.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
And with me today
is Kaia Ra, who

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:10%
has survived multiple
near-death experiences,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and has been able to channel a
high council called the Sophia

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Dragon Tribe.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Her mission is to educate
people on the Divine Feminine

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.262 align:middle line:84%
and help change
the human DNA code.

00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Kaia, I really want to
start by asking you when you

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
began to channel these beings.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And according to you,
they helped, basically,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
you survive when you
were a young girl.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KAIA RA: I started working
with the ascended masters,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
and my guardian angels, and the
archangels at the age of three

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:10%
consciously.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
They began appearing
to me to guide me

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
between the realms of reality
through these experiences

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:84%
safely and then to come
back to the earth plane

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:90%
safely back into my body.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And also, to help me maintain
a sense of connection

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
to my humanity for the
first half of my life.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They were really guiding me
through some difficult times.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Do you know why
you were able to see them

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
when most people, let's say,
may never have this experience?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
What was it about you
in terms of your soul

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and your past lives that
allowed this to happen?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: I've trained many
lifetimes in the oracular arts.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But I also experienced so
many near-death experiences.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, NDE is the
"clinical" term for it,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
but it was really
like dying completely

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and being escorted into
the light multiple times

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and coming back.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So I always knew the pathways
back to the source light

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%
from dying so many times.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And they really became
my friends and my allies

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to help me stay sane,
really, until it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
was a different time for a
different chapter in my life.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.515 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I know the book
references Mount Shasta--

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:90%
"The Sofia Code" book.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Mount Shasta is
fascinating for a lot

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of people who are interested
in the potential history

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
with Lemuria, for example--
this ancient civilization

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:84%
that Mount Shasta is
supposed to be sort

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:90%
of a remnant from that time.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And also, the legend has it that
it opens to the inner earth.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.192 align:middle line:84%
So what have you found to be
the power of Mount Shasta?

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: Oh, Mount Shasta is one
of my most favorite places

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.300 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It's such an incredible
sacred site, truly

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
a home to the ascended masters,
the archangels, the star

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:90%
nations.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well-- so
tell us about-- what

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:90%
is the Sophia Dragon Tribe?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.517 align:middle line:90%
Where do they exist?

00:02:58.517 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Yeah.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:90%
So the Sophia Dragon Tribe--

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I met them when I was living
on the site of Mount Shasta.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into the light
in a very unexpected moment.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:90%
In that moment, all of reality--

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.614 align:middle line:90%
physical reality was gone.

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I was just sitting
there with my laptop.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And out of the
source light, a voice

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
came and called herself Sophia.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was just in shock.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.575 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, the
Greek goddess of wisdom?

00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't see a form.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said no, I am the Divine
Mother Creatrix of All Life.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we had this very poignant
conversation about sovereignty

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and humanity's divinity, and
that she had a high council

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
of ascended master beings.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
There were exceptional teachers
on the sovereign divinity

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and how to
activate the reconciliation

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and remembrance of that
sovereign divinity,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
within humanity's
collective consciousness.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So I had been working with the
ascended masters and angels

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
individually for my whole life.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But when I met
this high council,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
there were so many faces,
and they were so advanced.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And they came from really
the highest spaces and places

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:90%
in the multiverse form.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I had
come home to the council

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.988 align:middle line:84%
that I was meant to work
with for the rest of my life.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And why are they
called the Dragon Tribe?

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do they actually
look like dragons?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: Well, that's because
of the Sophia Dragons.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.704 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
in the Kabbalah--

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
when they talk
about the seraphim,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
they talk about them as
the fiery creatures of God.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually give
them an exact definition.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They just call them
these fiery creatures.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in the
light with Sophia,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
there were these
incredible white dragons

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.955 align:middle line:84%
that were spiraling
like DNA helixes

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%
within the center of the light.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And their scales were singing.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They had eyes that would open
and all of these angelic wings

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:90%
that would whirl in and out.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't see where
they began or they ended.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I kept hearing the words holy,
holy, holy, over and over

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
They were singing.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
was at the throne of God

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- would be parallel
to those prophetic stories

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that you would read about
in the Old Testament.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.495 align:middle line:84%
But this was another
version of that.

00:05:18.495 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them,
who are these beings?

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said these
are the Sophia Dragons.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're responsible
for birthing

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the immaculate conceptions
of the Divine Mother Creatrix

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:90%
through their heart wombs.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So the cosmology of the Sophia
Code is quite extensive.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what I was
getting myself involved

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
in when they presented this
opportunity for me to speak

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
on their behalf.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a
while to integrate,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
but these are the highest
seraphim of the Holy Mother.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So they represent the highest
teachers of being able to birth

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.506 align:middle line:84%
as creators, and
create as a creatrix

00:05:58.506 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:84%
here in physical
reality, through

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:90%
your sovereign divinity.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Because here are these
most magnificent beings

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're committing
their free will

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to the divine will
of the Holy Mother,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
or Holy Father, whatever
you want to call God,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that one source light, to be
in service to the creation,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
birthing species, or
planets, or star systems

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.179 align:middle line:90%
through their heart womb matrix.

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It's stunning to see how
the universe is actually

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:90%
born through their perspective.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the Sophia
Dragon Tribe came from.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, because in the
journey of our self-mastery,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
multiple cultures around
our planet, especially

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times,
ascending to the mastery

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
of the golden
dragon was when you

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
were able to create
in the worlds of form,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
beyond the laws
that govern form.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So you achieve full
mastery over both planes

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of heaven and earth, to
live beyond all of that

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and the totality
of your divinity

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
as an unlimited creator.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big part of
what we are walking people

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
through with the Sophia
Code cosmology is,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
can you reconcile with
that much creative divine

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.332 align:middle line:90%
power within you?

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And it strikes me.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
If I think about the Sophia
in the gnostic tradition,

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
she is basically the
creator goddess as you say.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:90%
The source.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, her
creation was sort of

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
hijacked by the blind
son, the Yaldabaoth,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:90%
or however you want to term him.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Was that part of the
lesson that they're

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
teaching us is that
basically we've lost

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
touch with this direct
connection to source?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: Definitely about the
direct connection to source.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The Sophia Code is all about
initiating and mentoring

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in your direct
communion and connection

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
with your higher
self and your source.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
As far as the gnostic
tradition, thank God

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything about
it before Sophia showed up.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Because after this
happened, I went and looked

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
to the Nag Hammadi,
and I started studying

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:90%
different ancient texts.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, this
isn't the Sophia I just met.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:10%
I just met the One Divine
Mother of All Life.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a
creator Ayan goddess.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, this is not
a singular entity.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the light, and this
is the black womb of no thing.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
was fascinating was

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
some of that storyline that
is in gnostic scripture

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
about the Fall, and Sophia
descending into the world,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and her creation being corrupted
by whatever dark forces,

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.149 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
was that whatever--

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:84%
everything that was
coming through me

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.155 align:middle line:84%
was a healing for
the weirdness that I

00:08:45.155 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
was going through with all
these ancient texts that

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:90%
were confusing to people.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
People were looking to reach
out to Sophia's source energy

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to empower themselves,
to heal themselves,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
to experience what was really
happening in the early church,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
which was direct communion.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Mary
Magdalene, Mother Mary

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
were teaching direct
communion with Sophia god.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
the Sophia Code

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is a return and not just
for gnostic Christianity,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
but also, we represent Tibetan
Buddhism, Egyptian cosmologies.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
There's multiple cosmologies
represented in the Sophia Code.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Precisely.

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.725 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
the book was written,

00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:84%
basically to give the codes,
basically the keys, right?

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So we can awaken within
us our divine qualities,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and we can have that
direct connection

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
again to the council, to
source, and the whole cosmology,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
beyond just the
Sophia Dragon Tribe.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.707 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there
are many others.

00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: It's a mentor.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a modern-day
mentorship program

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to work with
ascended masters that

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to guide you to
exactly your direct connection,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
your own high councils,
your own relationship

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
with the ascended
masters, as well

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
as other beings
from other realms

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that are in your
highest and best good.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Why is it that
the codes are oftentimes

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
associated with numbers?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: Well, the Keycode
mentors go in order

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:90%
of the chakra system, actually.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So every initiation
that you walk through

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is building from
the root chakra up,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
a foundation so that you
are actually awakening

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.274 align:middle line:90%
the temple of God with it.

00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
You are the temple
of God, but you

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
are awakening your
consciousness and reconciling

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
with that belief system, as
you walk through the Keycode

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
initiations all the way
to the crown chakra.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And so will people--

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, will they find a
whole cosmology as far as--

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
if this is the Sophia
Dragon Tribe speaking to us?

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I'm
communing with them.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean they are
some of my ascended masters?

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But then might there
not also be others

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that might be more directly
connected to my soul's lineage?

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: So the
ascended masters that

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
are represented in the
chapters of "The Sophia Code"

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
are individual
stand-out Keycodes

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that have been selected as
a very specific blueprint

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
for awakening the collective
consciousness of humanity

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
With that said, the
Sophia Dragon Tribe

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
has countless
ascended masters, both

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of Divine Masculine and Divine
Feminine Christ consciousness,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that speak as a unified
voice as Keycode 333.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So we get initiated by these
initial Divine Feminine Christ

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
mentors.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.194 align:middle line:84%
But what that's going
to open you up to

00:11:19.194 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
is like what you're saying--

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.605 align:middle line:84%
your own additional
relationships

00:11:23.605 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that you have with different
ascended masters as well.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so you
say the Keycode 333.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
777 you talk about.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, personally,
I've associated with 555

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.760 align:middle line:90%
all my life and the number 5.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But does each one
have a certain power?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know 666--

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
people feel like that
must be the devil.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I've heard, actually, it's
more about the physical reality

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, because
of carbon being a 666 code.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So what is the meaning
of each of these codes?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: So when people
start to see 333,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:84%
often it means that they
are being either directed

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to mentor with the
ascended masters,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.293 align:middle line:84%
or that they already are,
and the ascended masters

00:12:00.293 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:84%
are congratulating them, so
encouraging them to keep going.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're in
a pathway of mastery,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
soul initiations

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
where we can get down on
ourselves and want to give up.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
to see 333, it's

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
encouragement to keep going,
and that you're on your path.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:84%
777 is the Keycode
for the Sofia Dragons

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:90%
in this particular cosmology.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's initiating humanity
into accepting and reconciling

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:90%
with its own angelic light.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
If we cannot accept that we
are angels in human form,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
we will not have the empowerment
and the grace within us

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to overcome what we're facing
right now on a global scale.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.981 align:middle line:84%
So we have to accept
that we're sovereign.

00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:10%
We have to accept
that we're divine.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we accept the
angelic light within us,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
we will also reconcile why
we were originally created,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.842 align:middle line:84%
which was to be stewards
of the earth, caretakers.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so
these number codes--

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
they are meant to
basically activate our DNA?

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that how it works?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Yeah.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
exciting about-- well,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.591 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of exciting
things about the Sophia Code.

00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in seclusion,
channeling this cosmology,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
they showed me what we
call the motherboard, which

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:84%
is a motherboard of
crystalline chromosomes

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the subatomic
universe of each--

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:90%
in our DNA.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.914 align:middle line:84%
And these crystalline
chromosomes interface with

00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:90%
the carbon-based DNA--

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
the biological DNA of your
electrons and everything

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that's making up you
to look like you.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you consciously
do these initiations,

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
it's building
bridges of light that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
activate your
biological DNA, to begin

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to operate from your
divinity's perspective, not

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:90%
your earthbound perspective.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So the Sophia Code divine
genome is always there,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
whether you activate it or not.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But part of stepping into your
mastery as a sovereign creator

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is to use the
power of your voice

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.377 align:middle line:84%
to command that this
activation occurs within you.

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is also what
we're initiating people

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
into with the Sophia
Code cosmology--

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is use the power of
your "I am Presence,"

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:90%
embody your higher self.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.075 align:middle line:84%
Embody your sovereign
divinity, command

00:14:15.075 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:90%
that it is so and is so.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And you will remember
your true self.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that journey of
embodying those energies

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and increasing
frequencies and levels,

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
you learn how to become a really
kind, loving human being that's

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.156 align:middle line:84%
also a master
creator of reality.

00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:34.292 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so that's
the point of basically

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
going through the
meditations and the practices

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:90%
within "The Sophia Code" book.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not as simple
as saying 111,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
222, 333 and
activating that way.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: I mean, everybody
has their ways.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You will become a
very different person,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
far more the person
you want to be,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.512 align:middle line:84%
the person that you came here
to be in your highest potential,

00:14:54.512 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:90%
especially those initiations.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Those are ceremonies.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:90%
When you step into--

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
you read those
initiations out loud--

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
you are stepping
into ceremonial space

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
within the seventh plane
consciousness of Sophia's

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Christ light.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.246 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are going
into a holy of holies space,

00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and you are claiming
that space for yourself.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
And you're saying I'm this holy.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose to leave
this U-Haul of old beliefs

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
here now and drop this off.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start picking
up the truth of my divinity,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
flipping on all my switches,
and living this now,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
from this space within me.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so in terms of your
initiation within the book,

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.445 align:middle line:84%
to my recollection, it's
like the first initiation

00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is basically starting
with the root chakra.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:90%
That was the Isis.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And it goes Isis, Hathor.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: Green Tara, Mother Mary,
Mary Magdalene, Quan Yin,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:84%
White Buffalo Woman, and
then the Sophia Dragons.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so each one is
associated with a number,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
essentially, as you move
up the chakra system.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Yeah.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're not-- it's
not to say that Hathor

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is exclusive to
the sacral chakra,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because her Sophia title is
She of a Thousand Voices.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So she is also activating your
throat chakra simultaneously.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But we have Mary Magdalene
coming in at that space,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
too, mentoring our
generation, how

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to speak the truth
of our angelic light.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I'll
release a book on how--

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
it's a channeling
healing modality book

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:84%
on how all these numbers
and the chakra systems

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
work together with mentoring
with the ascended masters.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
What's so beautiful
about this transmission

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't
have to understand

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how it's working for it
to be totally working

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
on you day and night.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Exactly.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
start to do the work,

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and meditate, and read
through the prayers--

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I would call them
prayers in a sense--

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
you're basically already
invoking the ascended masters

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to come into the space
and to work with you.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Very much so.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And what the promise is
in the Sophia Code-- what

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
they promised me-- this
is why I committed my life

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.759 align:middle line:90%
to working with them.

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I kind of-- chosen
to work with a lot

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:90%
of other different councils.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They promised me
that anyone who works

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:84%
through these
initiations-- that if they

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.761 align:middle line:84%
want to be mentored by them
for the rest of their life,

00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:07.969 align:middle line:84%
those ascended masters
will stay with them

00:17:07.969 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
for the duration of their life.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
They are committing
to you, because you

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.491 align:middle line:84%
are making a commitment to
embody your higher self.

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Going to
that chakra system,

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
if we go back to the root,
you call it the Keycode

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
1 in the book, and that's Isis.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when she activates,
is there something

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that people would notice, for
example, upon each activation?

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: So Keycode 1 is Isis,
She of a Thousand Names.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And she's activating us at the
root level and our root chakra,

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
a foundational place where we're
looking at our belief systems

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
from patriarchal
programming, and religion,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and different aspects that
come from an old paradigm, that

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
may be holding us back from
the truth of reconciling

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with our own divinity and
our sovereign empowerment.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we start out
of the gate with Isis,

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
it's an intense
initiation to really

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
let go of about 300,000 years
of patriarchal conditioning,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
so that we can truly
embrace, as Isis

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
did in her lifetime, the
truth of our royalty,

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're all made in the image
and likeness of Sophia god.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're all daughters
and sons of the Most High.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
important place

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to start to set yourself
up for this journey

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:90%
that you're going on.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing to me how
much that initiation really

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
impacts people when
they start out there.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.689 align:middle line:90%
And Isis is a ceremonial leader.

00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
she was for her nation.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she just loved
the pageantry of ceremony.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful that she
wanted to be Keycode 1.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So Keycode 2 is Hathor,
She of a Thousand Voices.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And when she
arrives, she arrives

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
with her entourage
of angelic, embodied,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
extended angelic beings,
the Hathor Star Nation.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And when Hathor lived on
Earth, her mystery schools

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:90%
spanned about--

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:90%
across at least half the planet.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
She was an incredible
woman who taught

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:84%
very high arts of
ascension and magic,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and opening stargate portals
and interdimensional travel,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and being highly conscious
in parallel lifetimes

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously,
how to shapeshift

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:90%
within your own physical DNA.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was extraordinary.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And she represents
where we want to go

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
as a species, what we
want to remember that we

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
can do through our own bodies.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
As miraculous as
it may seem, she's

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
here to mentor us in our
unlimited divine consciousness.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:10%
So part of her
mentorship is teaching us

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:10%
about the power of
our voice to command

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:10%
miracles, the power of our
voice to activate our own DNA,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.569 align:middle line:10%
and to flip on the switches
of the Sophia Code,

00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:10%
and begin to embody
our higher selves

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:10%
through that crystalline
light consciousness,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:10%
to be able to use the
power of your voice.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the Divine
Feminine movement right

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:90%
now, it's so important.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
women and men who

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
have been shut down
throughout the ages

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
for speaking up on behalf
of their direct communion

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
with the source.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what Divine Feminine
Christ consciousness is about--

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:09.646 align:middle line:84%
our direct sovereign
connection with our source.

00:20:09.646 --> 00:20:11.945 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Yeah, no intermediaries,
getting rid of those--

00:20:11.945 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the churches, and the
mosques, and the places

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.861 align:middle line:90%
that are basically like--

00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
tell you this is
how you practice.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
This is how you pray,
saying no, we all have--

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:90%
our temple is the body, right?

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And nature is a
reflection of God,

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and we already
have God within us.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Yes.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And further-- well, Hathor
teaches us in initiation.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Your body is the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an unlimited
Merkaba field that

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
can do extraordinary things
through the betterment of all.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.502 align:middle line:84%
So when we meet Green
Tara, Keycode 3,

00:20:42.502 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:84%
we're coming into
the solar plexus.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're learning
how to liberate our own.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Green Tara is the saviorist
in Tibetan Buddhist cosmology.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.685 align:middle line:84%
But what she is
initiating us into

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
is how to be our
own savioress, how

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to be our own
savior/savioress within us.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
lot of illusions

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have to work through
in our journey of awakening.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It can be very convincing.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we meet Green
Tara, she's initiating us

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
in how to use all of this
creative sovereign power

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that Isis and Hathor is helping
us to remember that we have,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you have this much
sovereign creative power,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
divine power, the next step is
learning how to be responsible

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.752 align:middle line:90%
with it, right?

00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
We've seen what happens when
we're not responsible with it.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:90%
And that leads us to Keycode 4?

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Yes.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because once you are willing
to let go of your attachments

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to suffering with
Green Tara, take up

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the mantle as a
creatrix or creator,

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
now it's time to open
your heart and soften

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to the possibilities
of that you're not here

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
to create alone.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
You're here to create in
communion with your source.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We call the source
Sophia in this cosmology.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
All names of God
are welcome here.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But the point is you've been
gifted a creative free will.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's all
great, but if you're

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
in communion with a
divine will, everything's

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:90%
going to turn into magic.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you're simultaneously
birthing creations through you

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that not only bring blessings
to you, but blessings to all.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like a perfect
orchestration.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So Mother Mary is
mentoring us in Keycode 4,

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
She of a Thousand Roses.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like all of
these rose petals

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
celebrating your
sovereign divinity.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, what are you
going to do with it?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
reconcile with what

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%
you want to do with it?

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when Mary Magdalene
comes in at Keycode 5.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if you activate your
heart, what also happens

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is your throat
starts to open up.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And you start to wonder,
what am I really here to say?

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
What's my message?

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
be seen in this--

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And speaking the truth.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.631 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: --higher self embodiment?

00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So Mary Magdalene is
kind of the indigo

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.715 align:middle line:90%
child of the ascended masters.

00:22:45.715 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
She is the darling of the
ascended master world.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's such a role model
for women around the world

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I get so many emails
about people's interests

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.650 align:middle line:90%
in Mary Magdalene.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Who's the real Mary Magdalene?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The Mary Magdalene that we meet
in the Sophia Code cosmology

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:90%
is dazzling.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Everyone likes to think
about her in connection

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:90%
to her journey with Jesus.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.420 align:middle line:90%
But she in and of herself--

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
exceptional role model
of diamond light.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And so she's here to
mentor us, and how

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.035 align:middle line:84%
to truly step forward,
and be seen, and be heard.

00:23:22.035 --> 00:23:25.906 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow
that to happen,

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:84%
it simultaneously opens up our
multi-dimensional awareness

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:90%
to all that wishes us well.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:10%
All of our guides, and angels,
and our own higher self

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:10%
that wants to continue
to communicate

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:10%
through our third eye--

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:10%
pituitary, pineal gland to
communicate that information

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.902 align:middle line:10%
through our third chakra.

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that when

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you start to speak
up and really be

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:84%
seen in leadership through these
energies, a lot of your stuff

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
starts to come up
at the next level.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of inner child
healing needs to happen.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of reconciliation
of different parts

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:90%
of your subconscious.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Different aspects
of ourselves that

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
are kind of stranded
across the universe

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that we need to bring home,
what the ascended masters call

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:90%
a zero-point calibration.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where Quan Yin,
She of a Thousand Waters,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
comes in and helps
us soften to how much

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
we're mentoring, being mentored
in, and what we're being seen,

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and to have compassion for
ourselves, which then allows

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:84%
for all of this power
and all of this creation

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to be relevant and
compassionate for others.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.482 align:middle line:84%
Because who cares if
you're hyperintelligent

00:24:29.482 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're spouting a bunch
of metaphysical knowledge

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.249 align:middle line:84%
if it's not relevant,
and helpful, and kind?

00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And is that
the last Keycode,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.165 align:middle line:84%
or is there
something above that?

00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: So at the seventh
chakra, the crown chakra,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
we have White Buffalo
Woman initiating us.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The crown chakra is where
we lay down the cross,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
really, our attachment
to suffering,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can't have a direct
communion with Sophia or God.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are initiated by
White Buffalo Woman into how

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to become a full-body miracle--

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
miracle makers,
really, commanders of

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
miracles through our direct
connection with our crown

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:90%
chakra with our source.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to work
in the energy of miracles,

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that's a whole other
level that we mentored

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and how to ground that.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
energy of lightning.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
energy of star nurseries

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
birthing new stars,
downloading through your crown

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
chakra of Divine
Feminine wisdom truths.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is a lead-up
to, I am this worthy.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I am good enough to embody
this much pure source energy.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So I'm just curious,
because you've basically

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:90%
channeled to these levels.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.227 align:middle line:84%
And I think people struggle
with this question,

00:25:44.227 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
because we live in
the physical world.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.518 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
say, well, if I'm just

00:25:47.518 --> 00:25:49.289 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the
spiritual all the time,

00:25:49.289 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not having anything--

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.204 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing anything
in the physical world.

00:25:52.204 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to basically have
to deal with-- still, bills

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.602 align:middle line:84%
and paying for foods, and
goods, and housing, rent.

00:25:59.602 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:84%
What does that balance look
like when you're actually

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
able to manifest in the
spiritual realm, that abundance

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
you can live happily on earth?

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: So one of the reasons
why I believe so much in this

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
cosmology is that it actually
helped me move from being--

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
living so far in
the spirit world,

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to having to find that
balance that you're talking

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:90%
about in a very real way.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.595 align:middle line:84%
Embodying your higher
self on a day-to-day basis

00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:31.051 align:middle line:84%
is something that happens
one step at a time.

00:26:31.051 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
believe in working

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
with these ascended
masters, because that's

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
what they're interested in.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.285 align:middle line:84%
That's why we talk about this
as a modern-day mystery school.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Because what
they're promising is

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
mentor you in those moments

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.693 align:middle line:84%
when your kid is screaming
and you're driving them

00:26:43.693 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to the soccer game,
or when you're

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a
fight with your partner

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and you want to say
this, but what--

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.904 align:middle line:84%
something that isn't going
to be kind or helpful.

00:26:52.904 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But then they mentor you on
how to choose something that's

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
constructive, and loving,
and opens the space

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:90%
for clear communication.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like this is how much help
we need as a moment by moment

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
relationship with beings
that are resonating

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:84%
at such a high frequency
of Christ consciousness,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that they can lift up
your own vibration.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what we find
in this cosmology--

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:84%
it's not about having to
remember things or figure

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:90%
things out.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:10%
It's about trust,
and letting go,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:10%
and allowing, asking for
help, being humble enough

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:10%
to ask for that much help,
trusting that it's there.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it's there whether
you want to accept it or not

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that
grace to come through.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of teaching
the 2018 curriculum-- but this

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
is the journey we went on in
the foundational curriculum

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
last year-- is
like, how are all of

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
these high
metaphysical teachings

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:90%
applicable to our daily life?

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know for a fact that every
single one of those masters

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.164 align:middle line:84%
has made my daily living reality
really a dream come true.

00:28:00.164 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Because all of a sudden,
we know we are not alone.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And we really have that support
and that spiritual sustenance

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.205 align:middle line:90%
and guidance at all times.

00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:10.002 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: And that they can
continually rearrange reality.

00:28:10.002 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
They can't do your
journey for you.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: No.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RA: But they can
continually, divinely intervene

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and orchestrate miracles.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can
stay on your path.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: That's beautiful.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.704 align:middle line:84%
Kaia, thank you so
much for joining me.

00:28:21.704 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been a wonderful time
discussing this with you.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RA: Oh, thank you, Sean.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It's been an honor to be here.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: My pleasure.

00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:10%
That is all the time we have
for this week's "Buzzsaw."

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:10%
I urge you to further your
understanding of the Sophia

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:10%
Code and the living transmission
of the Sophia Dragon Tribe

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:10%
at kaiara.com.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you
are the revolution.
