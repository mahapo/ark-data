>>SEAN STONE: What's the
connection between 9/11

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.477 align:middle line:84%
and the missing
Malaysian flight?

00:00:03.477 --> 00:00:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.053 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:18.497 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw" where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean
Stone and with me today

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
is Field McConnell, the
career military and airline

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:10%
pilot who is closely linked
to the flying events of 9/11.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
He currently hosts
abeldanger.net

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and today, he gives
us his perspective

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
on 9/11 and the missing
Malaysian flight.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:10%
So now, Field, I actually
want to start by asking you

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:10%
just a very basic
question about 9/11, which

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:10%
is that on that day, four
airliners were hijacked

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:10%
and apparently, they were
hijacked for over an hour

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:10%
without any type of military
and Air Force response,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:10%
scrambling of jets.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.575 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FIELD MCCONNELL: It's
impossible with the absence

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
of one document and
the document is written

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:90%
on the 20th of August of 1999.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It was an agreement between
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:84%
General Henry Shelton of the
United States and Major General

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Maurice Baril of Canada that
any time that Canada asked

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
for control of US airspace,
we would surrender the control

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
of the US airspace to Canada.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is what enabled
the attack of 9/11.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question, it's

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
impossible that the
United States Air Force

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.562 align:middle line:90%
couldn't drop those targets.

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So the
point was that there

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
must have been some
type of stand down

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
orders in order for there not
to be a scrambling of jets

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.692 align:middle line:84%
within 10 minutes, I would
assume, of a hijacked aircraft.

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: They would scramble
them even faster than that

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:90%
but there was an agreement.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The agreement was signed on
the 20th of August of 1999,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
which in my mind
demonstrates foreknowledge.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
rocket scientists.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The people that
did this-- it's not

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
difficult to undo
9/11 if you come

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
from a background in
air defense and you know

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about airliners.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's impossible that we
could not have stopped 9/11.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:90%
We certainly could have.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.945 align:middle line:84%
Well, then what is this-- the
argument that has been made

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
was that the
transponders went off

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
on the planes that were hijacked
and so that's why the Air

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Force couldn't find them.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Oh, that's
not-- the transponders

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:90%
probably did go off.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's examine
why they go off.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a device called
the Boeing Uninterruptible

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Autopilot.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
When it's remotely
triggered, the first

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:84%
two things that are shut off
or the communications radios

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.186 align:middle line:84%
and the transponder
and the ACARS.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But what is this
uninterruptible autopilot?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: It's a mechanism,
which the patents go back

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:90%
to 1953.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
It should really be called
the Boeing Honeywell

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Uninterruptible Autopilot.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
From 1953 to 2013,
Honeywell worked with Boeing

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and with the military community
to develop a fail-safe system

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
so that if any airplanes
were ever hijacked

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
they could be recovered
electronically and flown

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to a safe landing at
108 different airports

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
during the original version
of the Boeing Uninterruptible

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Autopilot.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, they could be landed
at virtually any airport

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
worldwide that has instrument
landing system, ILS.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But they're your
intellectual property.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: There's people
that think that because I'm

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the one that first
exposed it and I delivered

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:84%
that intellectual property to
my own sister whose name is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Kristine Marcy.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And she shared it
with some people

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
in our government who
appear not to have our best

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:90%
interests at heart.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: So what was your take?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what did you add to it?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.611 align:middle line:84%
You said it was invented back
in the '50s by Honeywell.

00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:37.804 align:middle line:84%
So what did you add
to this technology?

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, I am
aware of the patents.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I've got them all and I can
forward them to you later,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but the patents
from 1953 to 2013

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
document the development
of a safety device

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed to be used in
the event of a human hijacking

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
of an airliner to make sure
that the airliner would not

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
fall into the control of the
human strong arm hijackers,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that it could be saved
and landed safely,

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
thereby protecting the airframe,
the passengers, the crew,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and the cargo.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So what you're
saying is that there

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:84%
could be a remote piloting that
takes place of a craft that's

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:90%
been hijacked.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Absolutely.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.441 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And that's
what was turned off.

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Absolutely.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And this is not my speculation.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Boeing, itself, commented
in writing, publicly,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:84%
on the 3rd of March of 2007 that
they had deployed the Boeing

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Uninterruptible Autopilot
And they went further

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to say in their document that
had it been available on 9/11,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
9/11 would have been impossible.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Those are Boeing's words.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And yet,
isn't it possible

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that instead of those planes
being hijacked and piloted,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
actually the
autopilot was enacted

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and that these planes
were remotely controlled

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
at that point that
we were told they

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.795 align:middle line:90%
were hijacked by terrorists?

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes, that's
absolutely possible.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely what happened.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They were
electronically hijacked

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about four airplanes,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.315 align:middle line:84%
those airplanes being American
11, American 77, United 93,

00:05:06.315 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and United 175 and
they were all replaced

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
by full-scale drones
painted to look

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%
like the original aircraft.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And those four drones were
also remotely flown, obviously,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
because by definition, a
drone has no human crew.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, and as far as
the argument has always been,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
well that's absurd.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't make planes
disappear like that

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
to the passengers?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're proposing that
the actual original planes were

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:84%
landed at that point at some
type of secret military base

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and replaced by drones that
were then flown into the towers,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes, that's
what's commonly believed.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
There's people who say the
airplanes landed at ABC or XYZ.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The airplanes-- three of
the airplanes, all three

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
of the airplanes,
excluding United 93,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
which was 41 minutes
late and therefore,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
it was destroyed over
Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
The other three airliners,
American 11, American 77,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and United 175 were taken into
a military airspace, the name

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of which is Whisky
386 Alpha airspace

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and the aircraft, the crew,
the passengers, and the cargo

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.634 align:middle line:90%
was destroyed.

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Now, how do you know the
location where they were taken?

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL:
Because the military

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:90%
has records of all this.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
military has not

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
shared them with the public
or the media, that I know of,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
there's people in the military
that want the truth to come out

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and they've wanted it to
come out a long, long time

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and they have either
communicated directly

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
with people that they
have confidence in

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
or they've put
recognizable hints

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
into the official narrative.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And a perfect example is
there's four E4Bs, which

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
are doomsday machines,
the flying command posts.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:90%
There's only four of them.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
On the morning of 9/11, three of
them were airborne but they had

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
four call signs, the call
signs were Venus 77, VIVI,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
V-I-V-I 36, Word
31, and Sword 31,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
they had four call signs
for three aircraft.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Therein is a huge hint that some
white hat in the military left

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
for people that have discernment
and could read the tea leaves.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Why was
United 93 shot down?

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
seem to have been

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.747 align:middle line:84%
a part of the operation
in some capacity

00:07:30.747 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and yet, all of a sudden,
it gets destroyed.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
reasoning behind that?

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.439 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: It was
41 minutes late,

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:38.160 align:middle line:84%
departing Newark's
Liberty Airport.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And because it was 41 minutes
late, the US Capitol, which

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
was the target of the drone
replacement for United 93,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
the people on that morning in
history, all of the Senators

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and all of the Congressmen
were in session in the Capitol

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
building and they were targeted.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were
targeted by a group--

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and I do not like
to use these terms--

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
but most of your listeners would
be familiar with the shadow

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The shadow government wanted
to kill the elected government

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and if they can get
them all in one building

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.082 align:middle line:84%
and hit them with a drone,
our history as a nation

00:08:14.082 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
would have been
different beginning

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:90%
on the morning of 9/11.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank God that they did
not hit the fourth target.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you're saying
because Flight 93 was late,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that essentially, they could no
longer get the targets in one

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:90%
location?

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Absolutely,
because it was 41 minutes late,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:84%
the warnings that there is
another aircraft inbound

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.485 align:middle line:84%
got the Capitol building
evacuated and the Congressmen

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
and the Senators left and now
there's nothing to accomplish.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
You can destroy the
building but you did not

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
destroy the government
because the government has

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:90%
left the building.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But that's
actually what happened.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:84%
The government did leave the
building and they checked out

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.506 align:middle line:84%
and they signed everything
over to the Patriot

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Act and the Homeland Security
and this massive executive

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:90%
apparatus of power.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So it just seems to me, if
the Congress and Senate had

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:84%
been targeted and they,
at least, had some sense

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.547 align:middle line:90%
that they were targeted--

00:09:02.547 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: They were targeted.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Why would they not
have tried to oppose the shadow

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:90%
government at that point?

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: It's an
open question to how many

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
of our congressional delegates,
whether their Congress

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.411 align:middle line:84%
or Senate, how many
of them even know

00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%
about the shadow government.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.762 align:middle line:84%
I think very few
of your listeners

00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:84%
would ever have heard of the
United States Senior Executive

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Service.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:10%
My sister, Kristine Marcy,
started that in 1979.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I refer to that organization,
which is a government office--

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and anyone can google
it and read about it--

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I refer to them as Treason,
Inc. because I truly believe

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:90%
that's what they're all about.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And when they attacked my
country and yours, Sean,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of 9/11, they
didn't have their brightest

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
people on the job as it pertains
to the flying events alone.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So let's talk about
the Senior Executive Service.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have
an interesting background

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You went to the same high
school as Barack Obama,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
the same college as
John McCain, right?

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this
all coincidence do

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.399 align:middle line:84%
you feel or you happen
to be at the right--

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe perhaps because
of your family,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
at the right locations
at the right time?

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: I truly believe that
I've been put in this position.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not a position I
could have influenced.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not a position
anybody in their right mind

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
would want to be in but
for whatever reason,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this unique position.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But let me make that less vague
and more easy to understand.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Just as it pertains to
the flying events of 9/11,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I have three direct
connections, my sister,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to whom I delivered the
intellectual property

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
of droning airliners,
Captain Chic Burlingame,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the Captain of American 77
was my college classmate,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and the F-16s that
responded to the Capitol

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of 9/11 was my
Air National Guard flying unit

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
from North Dakota
Air National Guard.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't control what
my sister would do.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't control that Captain
Chic Burlingame would write

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:84%
the exercise called Amalgam
Virgo 01 and then be killed

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:90%
in the exercise.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't control
why the North Dakota

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
F-16s were in Langley, Virginia
on the morning of 9/11.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But all three of
those things happened

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm closely related to
all three of those things.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And so here I sit.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Right.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
What was that exercise you said
that Burlingame wrote, drew up?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: The exercise
was a flying exercise

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:90%
that he was tasked to write.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
He was serving as a Navy
Captain in the Pentagon

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
in the war gaming
department and he

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
was tasked to write a exercise
where air-breathing flying

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
vehicles would be launched
at iconic targets in New York

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and Washington and
they would attempt

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:90%
to strike those targets.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But because it's an exercise,
the air defense community

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
would protect the
targets and all this

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
would be done by exercise
with no live munitions.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
However, unbeknownst
to Charles Burlingame

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
he was patsied and
killed and his exercise

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
went live on the morning of
9/11 and there was live ordnance

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and there was about 3,000
deaths in New York alone

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.280 align:middle line:90%
and there's multiple wars.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
suspension of many

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of our civil liberties, all
because of 9/11, all of which

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
was an exercise gone live.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.839 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Absolutely,
and one of the things,

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I think to me always has been
most striking about the notion

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that these planes
could not have caused

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:90%
the devastation that they did.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Impossible.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: To the towers as
well as the Pentagon, as A,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.385 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon cameras have
never shown actual planes

00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
hitting the Pentagon.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Even when they disclosed
that the plane hitting it,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
it was really just
an explosion you saw.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
You did not see the actual plane
hitting the building probably

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:90%
because there was no plane.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And with the World
Trade Center, people

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
say, well, we saw planes
hitting the towers

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but isn't it
impossible for planes

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
to actually penetrate steel
towers at that altitude

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.644 align:middle line:90%
and speed?

00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes,
it's impossible.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But what's even more impossible
and more easily proved

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is the steel used in the
erection of those World Trade

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Towers, one of which
was 1,362, one of which

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
was 1,368 feet tall,
that steel, by design,

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
was guaranteed to withstand
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Jet fuel, if it's optimized
in its relationship

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to fuel to oxygen, can
only burn at 1,200 degrees.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no way in the world
that burning jet fuel could

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:90%
cause the buildings to fall.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And going one step further,
if they were to fall,

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:84%
they'd never fall in
their own footprint.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Pancake like that.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Well,
9/11 is a terrible joke

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:90%
and I don't think it's funny.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: You don't think that
United 93, that fourth craft

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that was shot down,
that could have possibly

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
been aimed towards Trade Center
seven, the third tower to fall?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
That everyone, to this day,
points to as the smoking gun

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The third tower that no plane
hit that really just only had

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
fire damage and all of a
sudden, imploded and collapsed

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
the way it did.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't think that would
have been a target for 93?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.798 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Well, one
cannot prove a negative.

00:13:51.798 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
argument that could

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:90%
prove that not to be the case.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And we know that World
Trade Seven, which

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is the Salomon Brothers
building, I believe,

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:90%
came down in its own footprint.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a BBC
reporter, whose name

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.197 align:middle line:84%
was Jane Standley, discussing
the fact with a live camera.

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:10%
The live camera is
looking over her shoulder

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:10%
at the building,
which is standing,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:10%
and she says and now we have
reports that Salomon Brothers

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:10%
as fallen.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So it may well
have been targeted.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
There were documents
in building seven

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that were not helpful to the
United States government.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
But the way these
aircraft, the drones,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
were flown, they could
put in ad-hoc waypoints

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and change the destination,
therefore, change the target,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
at any point right up until
the target was impacted.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But you say that
the shadow government was

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
behind 9/11 but I've also heard
you say that the United Kingdom

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Crown Agents are the main, sort
of, the critical conspirators

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:90%
of the operation.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Who are they and what
role do they play?

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Well, I would
always encourage your listeners

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and anyone listening to me
to verify the information.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's easily googled or
searched or read in a library.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
The Crown Agents were tasked
long ago, hundreds of years

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
ago, of protecting the
financial and the hard assets

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of the crown, whether it's a
King or the Queen of England,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:90%
the United Kingdom.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
However, in the 1800s,
the Crown Agents-- I

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
believe it was in the 1800s,
that's yet to be proven.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe they went rogue
and they started operating

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:90%
for their own benefit.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They operate out of
the City of London,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
which most of your listeners
think has 10 million people

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.265 align:middle line:84%
and it's a city of
England and it's not.

00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a one-square mile sovereign
territory within England that

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
even the Queen of England
cannot enter without permission

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of the mayor of
the City of London.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's three
sovereign territories

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
that were involved in 9/11.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.714 align:middle line:84%
There was the Vatican City,
which is sovereign territory,

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
there is the City of London,
which is sovereign territory,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's the
District of Columbia,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
which is sovereign territory
and has been since 1871.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
That's 1871, when the
Organic Act of 1871

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.814 align:middle line:84%
turned what we believe to be
our nation into a corporation.

00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: And so what role does
the Senior Executive Service

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:90%
play and your sister's role?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Are these basically serving
under the apparatus of the City

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
of London, the Crown Agents?

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: And the Vatican as well?

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The United States Senior
Executive Service,

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
which came into being
in 1979 overnight and I

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know if your
cameras can see my cut,

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
but overnight they
put a bureaucrat

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:84%
on top of every
existing bureaucracy

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
we had the day before so that
no matter how much experience

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and how dedicated the
people-- and I'm just

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
going to pick one bureaucracy--
but the Department of Defense,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
no matter how good the
Secretary of Defense was,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
no matter how good the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:84%
was, overnight they got
a civilian bureaucrat

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
on top of them that could
suppress information going up

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and could flood
information going down.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And we lost-- we, as
American citizens, who

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
believed at that time that we
were a free sovereign nation,

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.734 align:middle line:84%
we lost any semblance
of it overnight in 1979

00:17:11.734 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:84%
when the United States
Senior Executive

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:90%
Service came into being.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I find it remarkable
and also distressing

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that in 2016, so
very few people I've

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
ever talked to have ever
heard about this branch

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.026 align:middle line:84%
of our government, even though
it existed for 37 years.

00:17:26.026 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, that's the
nature of the shadow government

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.394 align:middle line:90%
and secrecy itself.

00:17:30.394 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump to a
more recent event,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.577 align:middle line:84%
which is the Malaysian
flights disappearing-- well,

00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%
one disappearing,
one being shot down.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.822 align:middle line:84%
And I think the irony of the
first 370 flight disappearing

00:17:40.822 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
was that people were shocked
that a flight could disappear.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, people who
argued that those were not

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.582 align:middle line:84%
the original planes that
flew into the towers on 9/11

00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
had said that the flights could
disappear because they said

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
they had grounded them
at a military base

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.901 align:middle line:90%
and people said that was crazy.

00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But here, you know, the media
admitting a flight disappeared,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
which is obviously impossible
because it went somewhere.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's admitting to
the point that flights

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
can be made to disappear
or can be subverted

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
or-- how do you say-- taken
to a military facility

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
or some location and
basically disposed of.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So is that what happened with
the Malaysian flight 370?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCONNELL: Malaysia 370
took off on schedule right

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:10%
after midnight on the
8th of March of 2014.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And it flew its
flight plan to a point

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
called BITOD intersection.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
At BITOD intersection,
the aircraft

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
was maliciously interfered
with using the Boeing

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Uninterruptible Autopilot.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It initially reversed
course 180 degrees

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and resumed a course direct
back to Kuala Lumpur.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It was taken a second time
and it's my allegation

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm betting my
life that I'm right,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that White House and
the United States military,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
who were involved in
two different exercises,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Cobra Gold and Cope Thunder,
I think they saw the aircraft

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
turn around and after
asking a very few questions,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
they determined that that
aircraft was being used

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
as a weapon and so the United
States Air Force took control

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
of the airplane and they flew
it to a safe landing at 0651

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of 8 March 2014
at what I'll describe as FJDG,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
which is the ICAO, International
Civil Aviation Organization,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that's their identifier for
an island in the south Indian

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Ocean called Diego Garcia.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
aircraft landed.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that?

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:90%
The aircraft was a Boeing 777.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It had a pair of
Rolls-Royce Trent engines.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Each Rolls-Royce
Trent engine had

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
its own self-generated
electrical reporting device

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that gave regular inputs of the
condition of all the operating

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:84%
parameters of that
specific engine

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and the location and the time.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:90%
That aircraft was never lost.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter to me what
Malaysia, Australia, the United

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
States, China, Singapore,
Vietnamese, Vietnam,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Thailand, none of them can prove
the aircraft was never lost.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It was ever lost because it was,
in fact, tracked all the way

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to a safe landing
at Diego Garcia.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And once again, the safe
landing occurred at 6:51

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
in the morning 8th
of March of 2014.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: So you're saying
that the entire idea

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.416 align:middle line:84%
that it was a missing
plane for months

00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and frankly, the media
focus on it for months

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and frankly, it's
never been found.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:90%
That's all false?

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It actually, it landed and the
people were safe and continued

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.646 align:middle line:84%
with their lives
or what happened?

00:20:31.646 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Half and half.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The airplane was landed safely
at 0651 at Diego Garcia.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The people on board
were dead and they

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
had been killed by one
of the two mechanisms

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I've shared with Malaysia, the
United States, Russia, Germany,

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
France, Australia,
China, Singapore.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I've shared the technologies.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I have
an official position.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just someone
who is close to this

00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
by my true history
and the two, I

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
call them illegal
modifications-- they certainly

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
were not illegal because
they were installed

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
with the blessings of
the Federal Aviation

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Administration.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
What renders them
illegal is the crews

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
of the aircraft were
never told about them.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
The maintenance personnel
in the world's airlines

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:90%
were never told about them.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And the dispatchers, who share
the responsibility for each

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and every flight, it's 50-50.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The captain of the
flight and the dispatcher

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
share the responsibility for
the safety of that flight.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.325 align:middle line:84%
The dispatchers
never knew about it.

00:21:28.325 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But how
were they killed?

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.659 align:middle line:90%
What was the mechanism?

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: It's called the
ATI, the air tranquilizing

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:90%
injector.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I can provide you with
the patent number.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
People can google
it and find it.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
If they were to search
for Malaysia 370 plus BUAP

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:90%
plus ATI, they'll find it.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is, the cabin
pressure on an airliner--

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use my
hand as an airplane--

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
as it goes from where it
takes off to 35,000 feet,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
they have to keep the cabin
pressure below 10,000 feet

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
so the humans don't need
supplemental oxygen.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:10%
OK, so the same system
that conditions the air,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:10%
whether it heats it or
cools it or dries it,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:10%
that same system can
introduce any type

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:10%
of a colorless,
odorless, tasteless gas

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:10%
into the cabin and the
cockpit of an airliner

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:10%
because if-- ostensibly, it's
a wonderful, safe mechanism.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
If there's a strong
arm hijacking,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
well, then the passengers
are going to be upset.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the flight
attendants would be upset.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the pilots would be upset.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They can calm the passengers
and flight attendants down

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:90%
by introducing this calming gas.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
alcohol as a metaphor,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
only because everyone
understands it,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
whether they've
ever had any or not.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
If you give a little bit
of alcohol to somebody,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't change
anything immediately.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.514 align:middle line:84%
If you give six ounces of
straight alcohol to somebody,

00:22:55.514 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
it's going to change
their behavior noticeably

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
within some number of minutes,
depending on their metabolism

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and their body weight.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:84%
If you give them a gallon
of alcohol in one setting,

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:90%
you're going to kill them.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:90%
The same is true of the ATI.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a dial a yield
or dial a dose.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: My point is, but who
would have released this gas

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:90%
to the people?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it the pilots?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: No,
whoever controls

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:84%
the uninterruptible
autopilot, which in all cases

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:90%
is an external agency.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:84%
In the case of a
US-registered airliner,

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
it could be the dispatch
function of-- I used

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to work for Northwest Airlines.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be Northwest
Airlines dispatcher.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They see an airplane
going off course,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
if they can't communicate
with the crew,

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
they could push a
button and take--

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: They could
put you to sleep,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.498 align:middle line:84%
take control of the plane,
make sure no one's harmed.

00:23:39.498 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you're saying that
the plane was being taken off

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
course to be used as a weapon?

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But what
was the purpose?

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
What would the purpose
of that have been

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.525 align:middle line:90%
with this Malaysian flight?

00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what were they
trying to do with it?

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.272 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: You mean, in
the case of Malaysia 370?

00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Yeah.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.586 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: That
question's unanswered.

00:23:55.586 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It's my opinion they were
targeting the Petronas Towers--

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
P-E-T-R-O-N-A-S--
pair of towers,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:84%
just like the
World Trade Center.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Petronas Towers are 191
feet apart where their walkway

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:90%
goes between them.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
The wingspan of a
Boeing 777 is 195 feet.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So just using those
numbers, you'd

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.736 align:middle line:84%
think you couldn't fly
between them without damaging

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:90%
the airplane or the towers.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the three feet, the
outer three feet of both wings

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is composite material that's
neither structural nor

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:90%
load-bearing.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, if 195 foot 777
went between those towers,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.700 align:middle line:84%
you'd introduce a whole
lot of shock and awe

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to everyone who saw it live or
even better, everyone who saw

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:90%
it an hour later on the news.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: But it seems
to me that once they

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:84%
took the plane off course
and it disappeared,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:84%
they could have
replaced it with a drone

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.719 align:middle line:84%
and attacked the towers just
like they did with 9/11.

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:49.551 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes, they
certainly could have.

00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:50.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe they did that.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: No, apparently
they didn't do it

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:84%
because the Petronas
Towers are still standing.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes, and
but-- I don't like politics

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that's all a deception

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
but there was a
wonderful man that

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
used to run Malaysia that was
responsible for that nation

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:84%
really gaining the
position it had in 2003.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.759 align:middle line:90%
Now he's no longer in power.

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: He's the one
that went after George

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Soros and those guys, right?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: Yes for war crimes.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And he happens-- I believe,
and it doesn't matter

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.404 align:middle line:90%
to me, that is a Muslim nation.

00:25:23.404 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I've been there
because they asked

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.903 align:middle line:84%
me to come explain what
happened to their airplane

00:25:26.903 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and I went there
and explained it.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
Muslims in Malaysia

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
are no different
than the alleged

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Christians in the United
States, the Buddhists in India,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
whatever population
is in Thailand,

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever they believe, people
that believe in a higher power,

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
they don't appreciate random
killings based on deception.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of
the global community

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
needs to get the
truth and I think

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
we're capable of
consuming the truth

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the truth
and not being terrified.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: OK, so Malaysia
Flight 370 disappears.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.985 align:middle line:84%
Then, Malaysia Flight 17 gets
shot down over the Ukraine

00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:05.362 align:middle line:90%
within a couple of months.

00:26:05.362 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really absurd to think
that the same airline has

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
been targeted twice in
these massive events.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:90%
What was that about, MH17?

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Was that a follow up
to the 370 or was MH17

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:84%
carrying something
that was aboard that

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.007 align:middle line:90%
needed to be taken out?

00:26:19.007 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: I don't know
what Malaysia 17 was carrying.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I do know that Malaysia
370 was carrying

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
some military sensitive
US equipment that's never

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
been rationalized
because to this date,

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
the cargo manifest
of 370 has never

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
been released to the public.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
In the case of 370,
they had 20 individuals

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
who were engineers
with Freescale, which

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
is the previous
Motorola, and they

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:84%
had the intellectual
property on a patent

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:84%
for the electronic stealthing
of any large aircraft,

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:90%
such as a 777 or B-52.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And when those people
were lost, a person

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
whose last name is
Rothschild was the other name

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
on the patent.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.916 align:middle line:84%
And he inherited the
patent because the patent

00:26:59.916 --> 00:27:04.090 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been approved until
after the 8th of March of 2014

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.730 align:middle line:90%
when 370 was allegedly lost.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But your question
wasn't about 370.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It was about 17
and wasn't it odd?

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was very odd but
something you probably

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
don't know, I'm sure none
of your listeners know,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
is that before I
traveled to Malaysia,

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.230 align:middle line:90%
they asked me to come down.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:84%
They asked me on
the 22nd of March.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I left Minneapolis
on the 15th of April.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Before leaving on
the 29th of March,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I told them in writing that if
they didn't publicize the two

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms, the
BUAP and the ATI,

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
they should fully
expect to suffer

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
a second explosive event by
1900 hours on the 17th of July.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
At approximately 1735
on the 17th of July,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Malaysia 17 went down after
it was taken off course

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and flown into contested
airspace in the vicinity

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.120 align:middle line:90%
of Donetsk, Ukraine.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And why was this necessary
and how did I predict it?

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I predicted it only because
all of these flying events

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:84%
are part of a pattern that's
been going on for a long time.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same perpetrators
and it's the same mechanisms.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Malaysia
17, I predicted

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that and people can judge for
themselves how I predicted.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I only predicted it
because it's a pattern

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and when it went down, that
started a fire fight or a food

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
fight between Malaysia,
the Dutch, the Ukrainians,

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:90%
and the Russians.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Notice I didn't say
the United States?

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The United States played a part
in that, too, I'm confident.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Sure, sure.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Well it certainly escalated
the conflict and tensions,

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
which have been ongoing
between the US, Great Britain,

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.310 align:middle line:84%
as I would say, a joint
power vis a vis the Russians.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Really Cold War redux, I
would say, is ongoing now.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Does this show essentially
that the power structure

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Western world being
centered around the Vatican,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:84%
City of London, and
the United States.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Are they itching
for war with Russia

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's outside
of their grasp?

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately is that
what this is about?

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCONNELL: I think so.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think if that is
what they're trying to do,

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%
they are doomed to failure.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I think Russia
and Vladimir Putin are not

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that easily hoodwinked
and I don't think

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.090 align:middle line:84%
they're afraid of
certain other entities.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
That's my opinion
and my opinion alone.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: What do you
mean by other entities?

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: I don't think
Russia, the Russian Federation,

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
afraid of the administration

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
afraid of Israel.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
afraid of losing.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're afraid
of losing any more airplanes

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:84%
like they did on the
9th of May of 2012

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:45.130 align:middle line:84%
when a Sukhoi Superjet flew
into Mount Salak, Indonesia.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And Russia was trying to sell
those to the global airline

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
community and the
day it went down,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I contacted Vladimir
Putin through GRU and FSB

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and some other organizations
over there and initially,

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
through their defense attache,
because I grew up in an America

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
where we were told the
Russians were our enemy

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:90%
and they want to kill us.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we gained a new
enemy, the Muslims.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to kill us.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Russians-- I've flown
with the Russians.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.706 align:middle line:90%
I've flown with the Muslims.

00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's killed me.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I met the greatest threat
of dying because of someone

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.227 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
wanting to stop the message

00:30:17.227 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and even that doesn't bother me
because the message is already

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Right, well
certainly it comes out

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
through alternative outlets
but obviously, we've

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
seen how powerful the
mainstream media is

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
in controlling the narrative of
what is the shadow government?

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And my question is how do
people empower themselves

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:84%
in a world where they really
can't trust the mainstream

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
narrative, where it
seems that the shadow

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:84%
government, whether it's
here, the United Kingdom,

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Vatican-based but it's
really a global instrument.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be so
powerful, so all powerful,

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.130 align:middle line:90%
it's almost daunting.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.881 align:middle line:84%
I think most people get
scared and terrified of it.

00:30:53.881 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you tell people--
how you encourage

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:90%
people to not be afraid?

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.029 align:middle line:84%
To basically say, look,
you can empower yourself.

00:30:59.029 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
afraid of this system.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to fear
their technologies

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
and their instruments of death.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And really we have a
possibility ultimately

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of maintaining that sense of
sovereignty and republican

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
constitution that the United
States was built upon.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Is there any hope of that
in the face of this empire?

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, you touched on
several things there.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
You touched on the
mainstream media

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream media
is controlled globally

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:90%
by 10 families or less.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And I just said families.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The entire globe is controlled
by a certain number of families

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
or less and that
number, I have an idea

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to poison
your listeners with my idea.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage anyone,
anywhere in the world--

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and believe me, from what
I see with what I do,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the awakening is happening
quicker outside the US

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:90%
than it is in North America.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But even in the United
States of America,

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Boulder
for 48 hours,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had endless
conversations with people

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
on the street, in the
hotel, in the restaurants.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly,
there's an awakening.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because
of this election cycle,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
because of the egregious
behavior of entities.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
saying, wait a minute.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.940 align:middle line:90%
This is completely nuts.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth?

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, the truth is the truth.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot find the truth
in the mainstream media.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't find it on TV that's
mainstream media influenced.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The truth is out there
for the discerning

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:90%
who do their own homework.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
330 Million Americans in
this country, very few

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of the two generations behind
the baby boomers, one's Gen-X,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:90%
one's the Millenniums.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Very few of those people
watch the media news.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:90%
None of them read newspapers.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The newspapers are
dying. "LA Times"

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and "Wall Street Journal," they
contact me a couple of times

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:84%
a week, would you please
give us $1.00 a month?

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
No, I won't because the stuff
you have is not worth $1.00

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:90%
a year.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The truth is the truth
and the truth is evident.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And thank God for
people like you

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and other people that are
willing to have people

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:84%
like me come in and
share what I believe

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to be the truth,
what you apparently

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:90%
believe to be the truth.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The truth is the truth
and the discerning people

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.580 align:middle line:84%
around the world are
embracing the truth.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's on the table
does not frighten them

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
but what has happened to us for
the last 15 years, or 200 years

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:84%
but certainly the last 15,
that does frighten them

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and it galvanizes them
into a common sense

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.170 align:middle line:90%
of resolve and purpose.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SEAN: Absolutely.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you coming
in and speaking with us

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and continuing your good work
and spreading that truth.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCONNELL: Well,
thank you very

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.411 align:middle line:90%
much for the opportunity, Sean.

00:33:32.411 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN: Well, there you have
it folks, great insights

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:90%
from Field McConnell.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything said here

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.394 align:middle line:10%
today but I urge
you to check out

00:33:39.394 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:10%
his website, www.abeldanger.net
and abeldanger.org

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:10%
for more details.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:90%
along the buzzsaw's edge.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Sean Stone.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:90%
You are the revolution.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:34:01.242 align:middle line:90%
