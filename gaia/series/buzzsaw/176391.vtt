fifth dimension and beyond.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the "Buzzsaw."

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.405 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:18.857 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Welcome to "Buzzsaw"
where we cut through

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream narrative to
explore the twilight zones

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Bruce Goldberg who is a
world-renowned hypnotherapist,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:10%
who has conducted more
than 35,000 past life

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:10%
regressions and future
life progressions,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
as well as an award-winning
author of 21 books.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.370 align:middle line:10%
His book "Exploring
the Fifth Dimension"

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:10%
teaches us how we can empower
ourselves in our present

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:10%
and future lives.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Goldberg,
I want to ask you,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
what inspired you to
give up your practice--

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:90%
you were a dentist--

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.579 align:middle line:84%
and to get into this whole
realm of hypnotherapy?

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:10%
>> BRUCE GOLDBERG: Well, I had
a very interesting experience.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:10%
I was using hypnosis for dental
apprehension and pain control.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided
to investigate

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.007 align:middle line:90%
going into past lives.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I had read the book "The
Search for Bridey Murphy"

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
about a Colorado case of
a documented past life

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
regression back in the '50s.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the very first person I
worked with was a woman I knew.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know her very well.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I took her into about
nine different lives,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and she overcame two
habits and a phobia

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't even
trying to work with.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And as a clinician,
that very much

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
got me into the idea of
doing this full time.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.037 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, now I drill
into the past and future.

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BOTH: [CHUCKLING]

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Ha.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Nice pun.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So, were you a spiritual person
before you got into this?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Actually,
I wouldn't say so.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I was more of a clinician.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.627 align:middle line:90%
I'm a real science kind of guy.

00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't against it,
it's just that I didn't

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:90%
have the time to do that.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in a very devout
science program,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and I had to support
myself through college,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
so I had to work very
long, hard hours.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But when I did the experiences
with the regression,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and I had some of my own
epiphanies in my own life,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
then it got me to
be very spiritual.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So now I have a much more
spiritual orientation to life.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because it's just,
it strikes me as bizarre.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I know many doctors, and they
tend to sort of veer away

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.862 align:middle line:84%
from the esoteric and
the spiritual side,

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to be
very materialistic in

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.778 align:middle line:90%
their approach, and rational.

00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, most
scientists and doctors tend

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:90%
to be more atheistic.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I am a monotheist.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.797 align:middle line:84%
I believe in one God, OK, so
I apply it with the energy

00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:90%
because I'm dealing with energy.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy-based.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe in a God
energy complex, you see,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's basically our soul
is a microcosm of the God energy

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So, in terms
of your practice,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:84%
your insights into these
other dimensions of reality,

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
basically, whether it's
the past or future,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
this all is based on your
own experiences and work

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%
in hypnotherapy.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Right.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I've taken patients into past
lives, into future lives,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and parallel lives.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I call that paragression.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:90%
So let me define some terms.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
To go back in time, in this
life, it's age regression.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.096 align:middle line:84%
Into a past life, it's
past life regression.

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:02.970 align:middle line:84%
If you go forward in
the future of this life,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:90%
its age progression.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a future life,
it's future life progression.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And if you explore a parallel
life in a parallel universe,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:10%
I call that paragression.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.192 align:middle line:10%
And I've done all these myself.

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So everything I've done with
my patients, I've done myself.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Is perfectly safe.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
There's no drugs or any
weird things involved.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it creates
a form of psychic empowerment,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
which is a way of taking
charge of your life

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
by using your
subconscious mind's

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
connection to the
perfect part of your soul

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
that we call the heart itself,
or the super conscious mind.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.083 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: I want to be the
devil's advocate for a second,

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.666 align:middle line:84%
because I know many people that
would argue it's all within

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
the mind, as you say,
within the unconscious,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and the imagination, and
everything that we are

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
envisioning of past
lives and future events.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
All this is basically just
the power of the mind.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.057 align:middle line:84%
How do you know, from someone
with a scientific background,

00:03:51.057 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
what would you argue to
say that that's the truth?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.556 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, let's go
back in time to my second book

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:90%
called "The Search for Grace."

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a documented case
of a past life regression

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that was documented by CBS
and was made into a TV movie.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the patient gave
me about 24 facts

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.065 align:middle line:84%
which were corroborated
by the network.

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
But here is the problem.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Two of the facts that
the woman gave me--

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
the age in which she was
murdered at the time.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
She was murdered in
Buffalo, New York in 1927--

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
was, she said she was
32 not looking forward

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to a 33rd birthday.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
The newspaper reports
all said age 30.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And the name of her
son she said was Cliff.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The newspaper reports said it
was Chester, Jr. Chester being

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:90%
the husband.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:90%
As it turns out, she was right.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:90%
All the reporters were wrong.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.005 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get in to
New York's health records

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
without a paper trail going
through the Governor's Office

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
or the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
most documented cases

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:90%
of the last century.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.564 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that the mind,
or is that reality?

00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are other cases
of documented cases.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.705 align:middle line:84%
Mine is one because it
was made into a movie.

00:04:47.705 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other cases
that are fully documented,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
so you can't make up
the documentation.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Mm-hmm.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the fifth
dimension that I referred to,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
you describe that
as the astral plane.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
What role does this fifth
dimension, or the astral plane,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.144 align:middle line:90%
play in our reality?

00:05:03.144 --> 00:05:04.101 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: All right.

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.332 align:middle line:84%
First, the fifth dimension
implies everything

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond the earth plane, so let
me make it a little clearer.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Astral plane is
just one example.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
associate with because it's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:90%
the most common example.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But you have the astral,
the mental, the soul plane.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You have the etheric plane,
you have the causal plane.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.445 align:middle line:84%
So you have a whole
bunch of dimensions.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Length, width, and breadth
are the three dimensions

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
that our body is accustomed to.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: And time.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.278 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Time is the
fourth dimension that's used

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
for a mathematical model
by quantum physicists, OK?

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And then anything beyond
time is the fifth dimension.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It also includes
parallel universes, OK?

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And each dimension has a sound
and certain characteristics

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:90%
that are relevant to it.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you're out of the body

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the
roar of the sea,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:90%
you're on the astral plane.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.272 align:middle line:84%
If you hear the
tinkling of bells,

00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
like in a new age bookstore,
now you're on the causal plane

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
where the akashic
records are stored.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
If you hear the sound
of running water,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
you're on the mental plane.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you hear the
buzzing of bees,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
you're on the etheric plane.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.369 align:middle line:84%
Or if you hear the
sound of a flute,

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:90%
you're on the soul plane.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: I see.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And, again, that
brings the question--

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
What does that affect in
terms of those planes?

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
How are they affecting
our physical reality now?

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
When you go to sleep at night,
you go through the REM cycle.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a dream cycle.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It's an alpha brainwave.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The alpha is a
level of hypnosis,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
so you're actually
out of the body

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:90%
when you're dreaming at night.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you sleep for
seven or eight hours,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
spend three hours--

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.846 align:middle line:90%
this is medical studies now.

00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
This is hard science now.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
We've known this since the 1950s
when we discovered the four

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:84%
brainwaves-- you spend
three hours out of the body

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
The question is--
Where do you go?

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Most people, because they
don't know what they're doing,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
or because they're
arguing with their wife,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
or they're worrying
about problems,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
or because they
had too many drugs,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
they go to the
lower astral plane.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a very bad neighborhood.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Like hell?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, except
you can get out of it.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Yeah.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So
it's like purgatory.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.598 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Purgatory, OK.

00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Whereas, if you
use the techniques I describe

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in psychic protection techniques
and more positive things,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
you can leave through the crown
chakra not through the third

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
chakra, which will take
you to the lower astral.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.970 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the crown chakra,
which is where you want to go,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
now you go to the
upper astral plane,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
or the causal, mental,
etherical, even soul plane.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
positive dimensions.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The only two negative dimensions
are the lower astral plane,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.315 align:middle line:90%
and this one.

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
You get a lot of problems here.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But the other dimensions
are all positive.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, you can
psychically empower yourself,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
take charge of your life,
increase your confidence level,

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
increase your immune system
if you have medical problems.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.289 align:middle line:84%
You can do what I call
astral negotiation.

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a problem
with somebody on the earth

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
You can summon their soul to the
astral plane in the sanctuary,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
the upper astral plane, and you
can work out the differences

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when they wake
up the following morning,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
they don't know what's going
on, but all of a sudden

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
they have a different
attitude towards you.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Pretty cool.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's
very interesting.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.623 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient
technique, by the way.

00:07:42.623 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
I Westernized it in my work.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: It's fascinating.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And many people are familiar
with past life regressions,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
obviously, but when it comes
to future life progressions,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:90%
that's more mysterious.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Just explain to us,
A, how does it work?

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.179 align:middle line:84%
And, essentially, are you
sure that people are actually

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
moving into their future
lives through your work?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about--

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
the concept of future life

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:90%
progressoin.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't document it
because they are hundreds

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.027 align:middle line:90%
of years in the future.

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you how
I developed the field

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%
on a more scientific level.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I did age progression first.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example of a
woman I worked with in 1996.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:90%
You'll see why it's relevant.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Her name, I call her
Tammy, not her real name,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and she graduated from
college in New York City,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and she came out to
LA to work with me.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
She had seen the movie
"The Search for Grace,"

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.748 align:middle line:84%
the TV movie, a
few years before,

00:08:30.748 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to
go out of the body.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go
out of the body,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:84%
you're in the
space-time continuum,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
which means you can see past,
present, and future events all

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.061 align:middle line:90%
occurring simultaneously.

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
Even parallel lives.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So she's a great patient.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
She's seeing things that
occur a day or two in advance,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:84%
like a psychic, and
they're coming true.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So now she goes
home, she's all done.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.504 align:middle line:84%
She calls me at the end of
June, 1996, and she goes,

00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Doctor, this is Tammy.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.459 align:middle line:90%
I've got an emergency.

00:08:51.459 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Tammy, I
retired from dentistry

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.166 align:middle line:90%
to get away from that.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.792 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I did your
techniques, and I saw myself--

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
Europe and Paris

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
the last half of the
summer to spend time,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.453 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going
to graduate school.

00:09:02.453 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, She goes, I
see myself taking off from JFK.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
The plane goes up, immediately
crashes, everybody dies.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.109 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Tammy, I don't
want to run your life.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.691 align:middle line:84%
Change your flight
plans, and call me

00:09:13.691 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the summer.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.523 align:middle line:84%
She calls me at the
end of the summer.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
She was going to go
on TWA Flight 800.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:10%
July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800
left JFK, New York, went up,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:10%
crashed.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:10%
230 people died.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:10%
All plane crash, all
passengers, all crew.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:90%
She would have been 231.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I didn't save
her life, she did.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The point is, now,
that's age progression.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:90%
That's documentation, OK?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:90%
So now we go into the future.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
a good example.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a
psychologist years ago.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:84%
He had a hand
washing compulsion.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
He was very neurotic.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you shake his hands,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:84%
he has to go in the
bathroom and wash his hands.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Washing his hands
50 times a day.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.025 align:middle line:90%
And he was very unhappy.

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The things that
haunted him in his life

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.436 align:middle line:84%
was the number eight
and the name Teresa.

00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I did a bunch of past
life regressions,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and a woman named Teresa would
kill him in the past life

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and turn him into
the government,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.304 align:middle line:90%
or all kinds of problems.

00:10:01.304 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The number eight, he
was born in August.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.803 align:middle line:84%
His grandmother, who
he was very close with,

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
died in the month of
August a few years prior.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So I take him into
the future life,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and he's a nuclear technician
in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
in the year 2088.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Note the eights, OK?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.949 align:middle line:90%
It's August of 2088.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.865 align:middle line:10%
He's in the plant, and
he's like a technician,

00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:10%
and it's late at night, and he
has a psychological meltdown.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
He just goes very neurotic
and goes ballistic.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Puts all the
buttons on meltdown.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Causes a major meltdown
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.444 align:middle line:84%
He dies, and a whole
bunch of other people die.

00:10:32.444 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So he comes back,
he says, Doctor,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.151 align:middle line:90%
how does that solve my problem?

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's go into
the other parallel universe.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:90%
That's just one.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So I take him into
the other frequencies,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:90%
or parallel universes.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
The one that's ideal, he's
a nuclear scientist, not

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:90%
a technician.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%
It's August of 2088.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
He's perfectly stable
psychologically.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the end of
August, no meltdown.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So what you're saying
is that there is different

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
timelines, essentially, or
parallel, potential futures,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.514 align:middle line:90%
Are there also potential pasts?

00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Yes, of course.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:90%
There's always timelines.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.991 align:middle line:84%
But let me just
complete the thought.

00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So this psychologist overcame
the hand washing compulsion

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
because of the
healing techniques

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
accompanying the
parallel universe scans.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I call this the
New You technique,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:84%
where you can see all
the various universes.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the past also has
parallel universes.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
We always have
parallel universes.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.785 align:middle line:84%
This is called
the brane theory--

00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
B-R-A-N-E. Quantum physicists
will talk about it, like,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:90%
membrane.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call that.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So how far, how close is the
nearest parallel universe

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to us?

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:10%
In August of 2000,
"Scientific American"

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:10%
did a feature article on--

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:10%
you know, they do a
topic every month--

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:10%
and their topic was
parallel universes.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The closest sister universe is
less than a millimeter away.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%
That's 1/26 of an inch.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:90%
that's how close they are.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: But a completely
different vibration.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:90%
We can't see it.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Right.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You have the same
physical appearance,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:90%
but the events are different.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to my
little TV movie thing.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1994, I was
working with CBS.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And the writer of
the teleplay they

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
call that, the script
for a TV movie.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
He was a good friend of mine,
and he called me up and said,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:90%
the movie is not going to air.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The network is not
going to authorize it.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he's really upset
because he wants it to air.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
So do I.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
So I said, I'll fix it.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:84%
He says, they don't
want to hear from you.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the network
that doesn't want it.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.015 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm not going
to talk to the network.

00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do one
of my techniques.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So I did my scan of the
different frequencies.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
We called them five
major parallel universes.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The one that I was
in, it didn't air.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But the one that I saw that
I found ideal, it did air.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And not only did it air, but
a lot of people in my life

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
came into my life that I didn't
know and had no control over,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
and so I switched tracks myself.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
train people to do.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
May 17, 1994, "The Search
for Grace" aired on CBS.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words,
I'm an example

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
of switching a universe
to another universe.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.085 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So it strikes me that
what you're saying is that

00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:84%
our soul is basically
being affected constantly

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
by our past, future, as
well as parallel realities.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Right.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.636 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the soul
as electromagnetic radiation,

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
like a TV signal
or a cell phone.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.887 align:middle line:84%
These are all
electromagnetic radiation.

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Most radiation in the
universe is electromagnetic.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:90%
It's harmful.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So the soul is an
alpha brainwave.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
You also have a higher self.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So on these parallel
universes, you're

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
going to have what
I call subsouls.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
They have different
evolutionary paths,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.044 align:middle line:90%
but you have one higher self.

00:13:21.044 --> 00:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I do with my
patients in the technique

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I developed many years ago
called the Superconscious Mind

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Tap is I train the patient to
connect with the higher self

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and raise the quality
of their souls.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: You could
even compare it.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
An analogy, I can
imagine, is this is me.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But at the cellular
level, my cells

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:84%
are having different deaths and
reversing different processes

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
That would look like the
subsoul level of reality, right?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Except, these
are different universes now.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, that when
you connect with the higher

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
self in the
Superconscious Mind Tap,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:84%
you raise the what I call
frequency vibrational rate.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as an
energy immune system.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So now you can be immune to the
issues that you were previously

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable to, and that's how
people can overcome habits

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and phobias and bad
relationships and insecurities

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
they want to overcome.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And once you raise
the energy, there's

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
universal laws that say
you can't lower it again.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So all you can do
is either plateau

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:90%
or go up to a higher level.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.528 align:middle line:84%
And that's what ascension
is eventually about--

00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:90%
perfecting the soul.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Perfecting the soul.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have to ask you,
speaking of the ascension

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:90%
process and the future.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've interviewed
thousands of people.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.065 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with
them on hypnotherapy

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:90%
of future life progressions.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.004 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell us about
what the future holds for us?

00:14:26.004 --> 00:14:27.961 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, the
future is very positive.

00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Once we get beyond
this century, we're

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.291 align:middle line:84%
going to have a much
brighter future.

00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
be working less hours.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
be very spiritual.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the 31st century,
that's when time travel

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%
will be actually discovered.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And time travels
from our future,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.686 align:middle line:84%
that I call chrononauts,
come back in time,

00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and they have
actually interacted

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:90%
with our civilization.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
first time traveler

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:90%
was a man named Taatos--

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
T-A-A-T-O-S. He lived
in the 31st century.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:00.220 align:middle line:10%
He came back with a crew named
Geb, Isis, Osiris, and Horus,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:10%
and they went back
to ancient Egypt.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And we all know they
were worship as gods, OK?

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
have, you might say,

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
advised us in our
technological growth.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.226 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
think of society,

00:15:10.226 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
we have the same raw
materials on this planet

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.609 align:middle line:90%
that we've had for 10,000 years.

00:15:13.609 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:84%
We've had some brilliant
people in history.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greece,
Archimedes, 2,300 years ago.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't we develop cell
phones then, or satellites,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:90%
or nuclear power?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of ET
and time travel connections

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that are more recent,
and that's why

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.029 align:middle line:90%
we get these extra intonations.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Time travelers actually
communicate with us

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:90%
in our sleep.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that 80% of
scientific discoveries

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and artistic breakthroughs
occur in the dream levels?

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Of course.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: And that's when
time travelers communicate.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: They wake people
with the aha moment.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: The aha moment.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.007 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So, in terms of
Egypt, assuming that they went

00:15:49.007 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to ancient Egypt and were
involved in the building

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.465 align:middle line:84%
of pyramids and
things like this.

00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that the
time travelers have

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
traveled to all types of
points of our history.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Are they coming here now?

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah,
they're here now.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But see, they won't
just go on CNN or the UN

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.312 align:middle line:84%
because there are men in black,
and they will take them out.

00:16:06.312 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
government agents.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are ETs.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
They work for the
Air Force, and they

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
don't like the concept
of ETs or time travelers.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The government does not want
you to know that they are here.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason being is
because the government does not

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
want you to know
that the reason why

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:84%
we have all our technology,
our advanced technology,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
is due to these futuristic
time travelers, and maybe

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.812 align:middle line:84%
some of the ETs, rather than
your tax dollars at work

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:90%
with the government, you see.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's that
self-interest involved.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The government is very paranoid
about the exposures of ETs.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They've always tried to bad
mouth them with disinformation

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and deny everything, regardless
of the evidence involved.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: What have you
discovered in terms of--

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.136 align:middle line:84%
you say the time travelers are
sometimes being intercepted.

00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
essential mission

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.468 align:middle line:84%
of what they're doing
when they come back here?

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that, ultimately,
if our future is bright,

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the government doesn't
foil them, obviously?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
They hang around
the fifth dimension.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.241 align:middle line:84%
When they're in the
fifth dimension-- like,

00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
think of the astral
plane as an example--

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the government can't
tell where they are.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They can't do anything to them.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It's only when they
come to the earth plane

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
do something to them.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.974 align:middle line:84%
So they hang around the fifth
dimension, interact with us

00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in our sleep level,
our dream levels.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.447 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose
is to help us grow

00:17:12.447 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
spiritually here because
they're us in the future.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we mess up this planet
and our growth as a soul,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
then they're going
to be affected.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like Michael J.
Fox in the "Back to the Future"

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
part when his hands
were disappearing

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
because the parents
aren't meeting, you know?

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So they have a vested
interest in our growth,

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:90%
so they're very spiritual.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ones that aren't
spiritual are some of the ETs,

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
like the Greys, the
Reptilians, and what

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:90%
we call the Lyran race.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:90%
They're not on our side.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.504 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the Pleiadians
and the Sirians are.

00:17:41.504 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
They definitely have
been our protectors

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout the history
of this planet, at least

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:90%
the last half a million years.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Mm-hmm.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.371 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned the
Pleiadians as being

00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
gatekeepers to the
fifth dimension.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
They monitor portals and
other dimensions, essentially.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:90%
So what is it, essentially?

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Are they our future selves?

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why is it that the
Pleiadians and others are more

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
interested in protecting
us, whereas the Reptilians

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and others are not?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: The Pleiades,
they come from a different

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.361 align:middle line:90%
They're not us.

00:18:05.361 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Although, technically, we all
have extraterrestrial genetics

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
because there's been
an intermingling

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
with the Lyrans, the Sirians,
the Pleiades, with our humans,

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
with our primitive humans,
for thousands and hundreds

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So we all have ET genetics
if you do the math on this

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:90%
or do the haploid samples, OK?

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Pleiadians,
they're just very peaceful.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.584 align:middle line:90%
They're Caucasian.

00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
They're about 5
and 1/2 feet tall.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They got blonde
hair and blue eyes.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.227 align:middle line:90%
And they look like us, OK?

00:18:31.227 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you saw a Pleiadian,
you wouldn't even

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
know they were an
ET because they

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:90%
don't look like the Grey would.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:90%
They are our protectors.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
They have actually helped
us from being manipulated

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
by the ones that were trying to
dominate us, like the Lyrans.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, they're
the big ones, OK?

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they have
been our protectors.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:90%
So they're gatekeepers of--

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
See, you can actually
slingshot across the universe

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
by going through wormholes.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want some of the
real nasty ones coming in here,

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.614 align:middle line:84%
so the Pleiadians
try to protect us

00:19:00.614 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
so the Reptilians and
some of the others

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:90%
don't keep on coming in here.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.384 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear a lot of
report about Reptilians.

00:19:06.384 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they're
cannibalistic,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:90%
so they eat their mistakes.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But, secondly, the Pleiadians
try to prevent them

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.559 align:middle line:90%
from coming in here.

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Let me ask you--

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
What is the interest in humans?

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do these alien--
or you mention

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that we have alien
DNA and whatnot--

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
but what is the interest
from the different aliens'

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:90%
perspective of the human race?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.256 align:middle line:84%
What is our potential
within the galaxy?

00:19:26.256 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, we are
a member of the universe,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.449 align:middle line:84%
and we are obviously
growing technologically.

00:19:30.449 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They've actually
helped us with that.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be part
of their team, in a way.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.421 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be going
into other planets,

00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
terraforming other
planets, so they

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure we're
not a bunch of barbarians.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't want this to
be the Visigoths going on

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Rome, you know?

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:90%
They want us to be cool.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever
study the history

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs, how there were times
when UFO attacks would be on,

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.029 align:middle line:84%
like when nuclear
missiles were going up,

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
prevent the nuclear power

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
mentality so that we
don't kill each other off.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking upon us
almost like we look upon, say,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:90%
tagging a dolphin in the ocean.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Where they're pets, so to speak.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:90%
I say pets.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Where they're ingenues.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
help us grow as a soul

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
so that we can join
the Federation.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: The Federation.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us
to the question of--

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
How much 3D karma
can we actually clear

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:84%
using the future life
progression techniques?

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.321 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, first of
all, you can avoid problems

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
in the future, like Tammy with
the craft and not dying on TWA

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Flight 800.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:84%
You can learn more
about yourself.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can empower yourself
by connecting with your higher

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.314 align:middle line:84%
And, most importantly,
with the parallel universe,

00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
with the New You technique,
you can actually--

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%
even if push comes to shove--

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.014 align:middle line:90%
switch tracks.

00:20:39.014 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But even if you
don't do that, you

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:84%
can connect with
your higher self,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
which accesses the
akashic records, which

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.251 align:middle line:90%
gives you information.

00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And, then, as you
access your higher self,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:84%
you can raise the quality of
the soul's rate, the frequency

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:90%
vibrational rate.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Become more what I call
psychically empowered, taking

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
charge of your
life, and therefore

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.384 align:middle line:84%
bettering yourself and
lessening the karmic cycle.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose
of being here is

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:90%
to ascend and get out of here.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: It does
raise the question--

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.677 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't our whole
soul family have

00:21:05.677 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:90%
to be involved in the ascension?

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for me,
as an individual self,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.834 align:middle line:84%
to leave if my soul family
is not at that level?

00:21:13.834 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Soul families do
not ascend to the same time.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might have a
soul meet a twin flame,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
like the female version
or the male version

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
of the same oversoul,
we call that.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.712 align:middle line:84%
But if your parents, or your
significant people in your life

00:21:25.712 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that had been together with
maybe a dozen past lives,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.129 align:middle line:90%
we call that the soul family.

00:21:29.129 --> 00:21:31.336 align:middle line:84%
By the way, they don't have
to be genetically related

00:21:31.336 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:90%
in past lives too.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
They can just be-- the
soul doesn't have sex.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You will not all ascend
to the same time.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.775 align:middle line:84%
You all have an individual
karmic cycle, you see?

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So you may be more
advanced or less

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:84%
than the people in
your soul family.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But the only ones
that ascend together

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
are the twin flame or the
actual true soul mate.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So, for example,
if I clear my karma,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
even if my father or
mother or my ancestors

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:84%
haven't necessarily
done that work,

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to
hinder my progression.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: No.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
hinders your progression

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is you, and your
experiences, and what you

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.096 align:middle line:90%
allow into your life.

00:22:03.096 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the problems people
have in life, with my patients,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.928 align:middle line:90%
they deal with victimization.

00:22:06.928 --> 00:22:08.082 align:middle line:90%
It's a major issue.

00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
They don't stand
up for themselves.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They let people take
advantage of them,

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a husband and
wife relationship, child

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.960 align:middle line:84%
relationship, or their
employers, whatever.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, I teach
them how to confront--

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not an argument,
it's confrontation--

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to prevent victimization,
and then to rise above it.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:90%
So you need to do that.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't play defense.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
charge of your life

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.855 align:middle line:84%
and send out the
energy to attract

00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:35.092 align:middle line:84%
less and less of the
negative people in your life.

00:22:35.092 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Because with the
law of attraction,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the energy you send
out is what you get.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.837 align:middle line:84%
So if you empower
yourself, you're

00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
going to have a much better
life and a lot less problems

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.379 align:middle line:84%
So, if, in your research,
we have parallel selves that

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:84%
are actually living
on earth, is this

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%
like a twin or a doppelganger?

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's separate parallel
selves from a parallel life.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
A parallel life is going to
the different frequencies,

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:90%
the parallel universes.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Sure.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: OK?

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So those are you, the
same genetic makeup,

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:90%
in different universes.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
A parallel self
is your soul, not

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:84%
your genetic body, occupying
more than one person

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.544 align:middle line:90%
in this time frame.

00:23:09.544 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: In this time frame.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So let me
give you an example.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So, years ago, I
worked with a salesman

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:90%
from Baltimore, Maryland.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
He used to go to Cincinnati,
Ohio, on his little thing

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:90%
here, right?

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So he says, Doctor, I
want to do a regression.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.433 align:middle line:84%
So I take him into what I
thought was a past life.

00:23:23.433 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, he's a woman
living in Cleveland, Ohio,

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:90%
in the same time frame.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.019 align:middle line:84%
He gets her name,
address, telephone number.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:90%
He says, what the heck is this?

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look,
you're a salesman.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.508 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you call her the next
time you're in Cincinnati--

00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:90%
it's only a few hours away--

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and why don't you meet her?

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Use your personality.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So he does.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So he reports to me
that she meets him.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, so, how did it go?

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
He goes, it's the
weirdest experience

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:90%
I've had in my entire life.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:90%
We were like the same person.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:90%
That was his parallel self.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: So it
wasn't a twin flame?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.267 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: No, it was
simply his soul splitting

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and occupying two different
bodies that were genetically

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
different, they're not
related family-wise,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.185 align:middle line:90%
in the same parallel universe.

00:24:00.185 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: This strikes
me when I hear people--

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.886 align:middle line:84%
Many people have said, I'm
Mary Magdalene, I'm Cleopatra.

00:24:04.886 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't it possible
that that soul energy was

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.729 align:middle line:84%
so powerful, it did shatter
into dozens of people?

00:24:10.729 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, yes you can.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the parallel
self analogy.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whether it's
a historical figure,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
a celebrity, as we say, or
whether it's an average Joe

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:90%
or Jane, the soul can split.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you
take a beam of light

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and you put a piece of
wood in front of it,

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:90%
it's going to split.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.685 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
lose any photons.

00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The law of the conservation
of matter and energy.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
But you can split.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The soul is
electromagnetic radiation.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It's pure energy.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Not perfect energy,
but pure energy.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, of course,
it can split.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.859 align:middle line:84%
And parallel selves is an
example of it splitting.

00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: By the way,
just out of curiosity,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
have you seen this thing about
celebrity time travelers?

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
They have these
great photographs,

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.758 align:middle line:84%
that people can
look at on YouTube,

00:24:45.758 --> 00:24:48.002 align:middle line:84%
and there's pictures of
Jay-Z in the 1920s in Harlem.

00:24:48.002 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Yeah,
I've seen those.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Like Brad Pitt and
Nick Cage and all these guys,

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and Stallone looks just like
one of the Popes, right?

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Sylvester Stallone.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.378 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: Well, you
understand, as a doctor,

00:24:58.378 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I have to use my
genetic background.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The gene pool that we have,
OK, it wouldn't be impossible.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
There's an old theory
that says, everybody

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
has a doppelganger
or somebody who

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:84%
looks just like you
around the world sometime.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.785 align:middle line:84%
So going back in time and
having some celebrity who

00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
looks like a current
person now does not

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.918 align:middle line:84%
mean that that was
their past life.

00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It could just be
the genetic pool.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's where you
have to figure that in.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: It's pretty
uncanny, though.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: It is.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: The resemblances.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: It's
a lot of fun too.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SEAN: Could it
be a past life?

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: It could be.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Sure it is.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.027 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, the
late Ian Stevenson,

00:25:27.027 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:84%
who did a lot of work with
reincarnation over the years.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
He was a professor emeritus
at the University of Virginia.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.401 align:middle line:84%
He found out that,
let's say somebody

00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:90%
gets stabbed in a past life.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The marking on a current-life
person, when they reincarnate,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:84%
would be in the
exact same location.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Sure.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> GOLDBERG: So that's a mark
that can carry over into a past

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Why can't the genetic tendency
from a person hundreds of years

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.427 align:middle line:90%
ago carry over now?

00:25:47.427 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Most people do not reincarnate
in the same genetic line,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I've done 35,000 of them.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.787 align:middle line:84%
Very few people stay in
the same genetic line.

00:25:53.787 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: Absolutely.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So what do you consider to be
the main objective of the work

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing?

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:10%
>> GOLDBERG: What I'm trying
to do is to empower people

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:10%
psychically.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:10%
So what I want them
to do is overcome

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:10%
what I call self-defeating
sequences, forms

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:10%
of self-sabotage.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Allow them to perceive
past and future lives,

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
if they're interested,
to learn more

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
about themselves, their karmic
purpose, as I call that.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
ascension training,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to constantly
work out their karma

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
so that eventually the
balance sheet is zero,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and then they could rejoin
the God energy complex

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and not have to reincarnate.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The average person
watching the show today

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
has had probably
1,000 past lives.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:90%
That is not impressive.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
as few as possible,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.917 align:middle line:90%
and you want to get out of here.

00:26:34.917 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SEAN: [CHUCKLES]

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Goldberg, thank you
so much for joining me.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.402 align:middle line:90%
>> GOLDBERG: My pleasure.

00:26:40.402 --> 00:26:42.443 align:middle line:10%
>> SEAN: And that's all
the time we have for this

00:26:42.443 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:10%
week's "Buzzsaw."

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:10%
