00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.991 align:middle line:84%
>>What can the symbols of
Masonry reveal about yourself?

00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's enter the buzzsaw.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.695 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:18.526 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Buzzsaw," where
we cut through the mainstream

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:84%
narrative to explore
the hidden truths.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Sean
Stone, and with me today

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:10%
is Michael Schiavello,
who became a 32nd degree

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
Mason of the Ancient and
Accepted Scottish Rite in 2014.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Today he enlightens us with
knowledge from his book,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:10%
"Know Thyself, Using the
Symbols of Freemasonry

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
to Improve Your Life."

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So I have to start
by asking you,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
do you actually offer the
secrets of Masonry in the book?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.279 align:middle line:90%
>>You know what?

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:10%
That's an interesting
question, Sean,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:10%
because as far as
I see it, there

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:10%
are no great secrets
in Freemasonry.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
The only secrets that
a Freemason truly

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
promises not to reveal
are the passwords

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and the secret handshakes,
I guess you could say.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
is to test the mettle

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.259 align:middle line:90%
of a man's character, really.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing there that
you can't find online.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.758 align:middle line:84%
A quick Google
search will find you

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
the passwords of Freemasonry.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They'll find you pictures
of the secret handshakes

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.942 align:middle line:90%
of Freemasonry.

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But we choose to
take an obligation

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to keep those things
secret because it tests

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:90%
the mettle of your character.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
If you can't trust someone to
keep a pretty basic secret,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
you can't really trust
them as a person.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.098 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these secrets
have come out, as you say,

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
because of Google
in the modern age.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But historically,
there have been

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of degrees of
initiation that were secret

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and maintained as such.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, there
has been a tradition

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
of symbolism and secrecy
that's passed on for a reason.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been
altered every year,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:84%
as it could have been if there
wasn't something there to it.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>I think what has happened over
time is that secrecy has always

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:90%
been a part of learning.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.656 align:middle line:84%
You can go back to the
ancient mystery schools

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and talk about Pythagoras, a
couple of thousand years ago.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And secrecy for him and
amongst his students

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.115 align:middle line:90%
was of the utmost importance.

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason, again, a, to
test the person's character,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but b, also, once
something is secret,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
it's only secret
until it's known.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Once something is known,
it's no longer a secret.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.554 align:middle line:84%
But when there's important
knowledge to be attained

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and that knowledge
is kept secret,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:90%
it means you have to go for it.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:90%
You have to climb towards it.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.745 align:middle line:84%
It's not just handed to
you on on a silver platter.

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So the more that you aspire
towards that knowledge,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
the more that you
aim towards that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.406 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, the
more that knowledge

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:90%
becomes valuable to you.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Any secret is valuable,
but once revealed,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:90%
it's no longer a secret.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.247 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, Freemasonry
has kept up that position

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient Greeks and
the ancient Egyptian mystery

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.360 align:middle line:84%
schools as well of using
secrecy as a method of teaching.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
there, you find out

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that the secrets
aren't great secrets.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.212 align:middle line:90%
The knowledge is superb.

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:90%
But the secrets aren't great.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it
allows you to be

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
able to attain that knowledge
that was kept secret to allow

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
you to aspire towards
it, whereas if it's

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
open for everyone, well then,
anyone could look it up online.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't get the
necessary teaching

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
that it ingrains on you.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.878 align:middle line:84%
So then what are
some of the-- what

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is some of the knowledge
then that is held

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:90%
within the symbols of Masonry?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Mostly the Masonic
symbols convey moral lessons

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
for how to live
your life better.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The aim of Freemasonry
is-- Freemasonry

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.659 align:middle line:90%
is a path to self-improvement.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It's many things to
many people, but that's

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%
the way I like to summarize it.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people choose to
look for different avenues

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of self-improvement
in their lives.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Some people choose to do yoga.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people choose
to do meditation.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people choose
a religious path.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Some people choose other
avenues of higher learning.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But the destination of all
these various paths is the same.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The destination is to
improve yourself as a person

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and become the very best
person you can possibly be.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry, the way
I see it, is simply

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
another path, time-tested and
proven over hundreds of years,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
if not dating back
thousands of years,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
through use of symbols to
make yourself into the best

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.611 align:middle line:90%
person you can possibly be.

00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And we use these
symbols, as I said,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to convey a lot of moral lessons
on to how to lead your life,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
how to become a better person,
a lot of spiritual lessons

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But basically, how to ascend
above your animal nature,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
above your material self,
above your brute nature.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You look at the symbol of the
Masonic square and compass,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
which is probably the most
famous of all Masonic symbols,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and you see the Masonic square.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The square represents
your material side,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
because a square doesn't
appear in nature.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, a square is
something manufactured by man.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:10%
The compasses draw a circle.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.085 align:middle line:84%
Now, something that does
appear in nature is a circle.

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:84%
We see circles everywhere,
throughout nature.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's natural.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It's given to us by
God, the source, spirit,

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
your comprehension of God.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
compasses sitting

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
above the square
on the Masonic logo

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.842 align:middle line:84%
symbolize that you have
transcended your base

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:90%
nature, your material nature.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
the square, which

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
is something made up by man.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You become the
compasses, which means

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
you have attained a higher
level of learning where

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness has expanded
and your spirituality has

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
expanded and your connection to
the source is growing closer.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>So would you say that
ultimately the symbolism found

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
within Masonry is
actually more indicative

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy and alchemical
processes as Jung, for example,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:84%
studied and said,
well, most of alchemy--

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
there might be some relationship
to chemistry, obviously.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.022 align:middle line:84%
And some people have said
they've created gold from lead.

00:05:20.022 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, alchemy
is actual spiritual journey.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that's the meaning
of most of the symbolism?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.862 align:middle line:84%
>>Alchemy and
Freemasonry have always

00:05:26.862 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
been tied closely together,
and not in the sense of alchemy

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.111 align:middle line:84%
as you were saying,
turning lead from gold,

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
but the sense that alchemy
is more so transmutation.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Lead from gold is the
equivalent of turning material

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
into spiritual, turning your
lower self into your higher

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.474 align:middle line:84%
You are transmuting from
one form of yourself

00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
to another form of yourself.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
You're simply becoming
a better person.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us in life go
through a form of alchemy.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.897 align:middle line:84%
When you join-- let's say you
join a martial arts class.

00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You put on that white
belt and your gi

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and you go inside the dojo.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:90%
You're basic.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:90%
You're a beginner.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:90%
You don't know anything.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.318 align:middle line:84%
But through the lessons you
are taught by your sensei

00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
or by your kru in Muay Thai
or by your sifu in Kung Fu,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
you go from white belt up
to brown belt, green belt,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
yellow belt, brown
belt, black belt, where

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:90%
you attain the higher learning.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You've transmuted yourself from
a basic beginner to a higher

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, alchemy does
exist in most forms of learning.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's a good point you made.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I think Freemasonry
is a form of alchemy,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's a spiritual alchemy.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a personal alchemy.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not a physical alchemy
where we're transferring lead

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:90%
into gold.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.641 align:middle line:84%
Well, give us an example of
some of these major symbols

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
in Masonry and how they applied
towards knowing ourselves.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.641 align:middle line:84%
Well, we talked about the
square and the compass.

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about another one.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about a beehive.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
A beehive is a
symbol in Freemasonry

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.726 align:middle line:84%
that occurs in the third degree
of Freemasonry, the Master

00:06:44.726 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Mason degree, which technically
is the highest level of Masonry

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
you can attain.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.809 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear other
people say they're

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:84%
a 32nd degree Mason or they're
a Knights Templar Mason.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But really, a third degree is
the highest you can attain.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the
extracurricular learning

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Scottish Rite or the York
Rite branches off horizontally.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So the beehive is contained
in the third degree.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
At its very basic,
a beehive symbolizes

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
everyone working together
for the good of each other,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
because the bee really is
the most altruistic creature

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:90%
in existence.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.396 align:middle line:84%
The bee is the only creature
that goes out of its way

00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
not to serve itself--
it's not self-serving--

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:90%
but to serve the hive.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.592 align:middle line:84%
They're going out and gathering
the-- distributing the pollen

00:07:20.592 --> 00:07:22.925 align:middle line:84%
and gathering the honey and
bringing it back to the hive

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and serving the
betterment of the hive.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.151 align:middle line:84%
So really, what a
beehive is teaching

00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:28.699 align:middle line:84%
us is to work together, that
you and I need to work together.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Even in this interview,
we need to work together.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:90%
We need to gel together.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And even the way that
a beehive is structured

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
with its hexagonal
honeycombs throughout,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
it's the most perfect
structure of any structure

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:90%
that nature can build.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It leaves the least gaps
between the hexagons.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And the bees work perfectly
within that environment.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So it just goes to show
that when a normal person--

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.146 align:middle line:90%
I won't say a normal person.

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
When what we call a cowan
in Freemasonry, which

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.704 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who is not a
Freemason, looks at a beehive

00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
they see a dwelling
place for bees

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they get scared
that they get to get stung

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and they try and get
rid of the beehive.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.918 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I think they
would just be afraid

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that the Masons are basically
looking at themselves as sort

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of the managers, and
that the rest of society

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
are just the bees who
are being managed.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, no.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>And they look at themselves
as being outside of it, profane,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.439 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Profane's another
word that's used,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:90%
but I wouldn't say that at all.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a beautiful
symbol that says, hey,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.401 align:middle line:90%
we need to work together.

00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop being
bigots towards each other.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop racism
towards each other.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
belittling each other.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
criticizing each other.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to work for the
greater good of humanity,

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
all together as one.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
There's not black race and
white race and Asian race

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and this race and other races.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:90%
There's the human race.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.833 align:middle line:90%
We're all together as one.

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
We're all bound as one, so
therefore let's work together.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when you look
at a symbol like the beehive,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.663 align:middle line:90%
there's beautiful meaning to it.

00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
You look at a symbol like the
gavel, the common gavel it's

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
called in Freemasonry,
we all see

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
a gavel used in a courthouse.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We see a gavel used
by auctioneers.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the Masonic lodge,
the master of the lodge

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
uses a gavel to call
the craft to attention

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:90%
or call them to recess.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.366 align:middle line:84%
But what the gavel
really is-- you go back

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
to the old stonemason's
tools, where

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the tools and
working tools of Freemasonry

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
were plucked from, is
that the gavel broke off

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.984 align:middle line:84%
the rough edges of the
stones and shaped the stone

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:90%
for the builder's use.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So really, as Freemasons
what we're doing

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
is we are using
these working tools

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
we call them to build ourselves
into the best people we can be.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
We're chipping off
our rough edges.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And really what the
Masonic gavel teaches

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
is willpower,
having the willpower

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to say no to certain things.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.865 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating that
extra slice of cake,

00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
if you're gambling with your
hard-earned money, if you're

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.814 align:middle line:84%
going out and
binge-drinking at night

00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
when you should be spending
time with your family at home,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the gavel teaches you when
we look at it as Freemasons

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.312 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, you need to exert
willpower over your life.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to chip off
those superfluities.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Or to create
order out of chaos.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>Create order out of chaos.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>In terms of-- many people
see some of these symbols,

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
particularly I would just
think of the all-seeing eye

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
within the pyramid-- Jay
Z has popularized that

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:90%
within mass culture.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And we see other symbols
being deployed oftentimes

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in mass culture, whether
it's in film or music.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And does that indicate to
you that these are just

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.914 align:middle line:84%
people who are seeing who
is on the level with them

00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and showing that they're on a
certain level of initiation?

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think that
they're just simply using

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:90%
it to promote themselves?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.594 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just
curious how you read--

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>I think someone like
Jay Z is using that symbol

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
to make money, to
promote himself,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.739 align:middle line:84%
to try and get that
different market from what

00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
other people have established
with the clothing market.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
The eye within the pyramid is
not a Masonic logo as such.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't appear in any of the
three degrees of Freemasonry.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no mention
of the pyramid.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The all-seeing eye
does appear, but people

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
have given the all-seeing eye
a very bad rap over the years.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's one of the
most beautiful symbols of all.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It basically teaches
you that there's

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
a greater power than
you watching over you,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:90%
making sure you don't screw up.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
When you think--
you're at the checkout

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
lane at the supermarket, those
personal scanners, right?

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You scan your toilet paper
and you scan your toothpaste

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and you scan your bag of apples,
and then your bag of Doritos.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.469 align:middle line:90%
And you think, no one's looking.

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to scan it.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.905 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put it in my trolley.

00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Then you scan another
couple of items

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't
scan the next item.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, really, if there
was someone watching,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
if you were at a checkout
and the teller was there,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be able
to get away with that.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And the all-seeing
eye symbolizes

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that, symbolizes a higher
power watching over you.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.506 align:middle line:90%
It symbolizes karma.

00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It says to you--
it's the referee

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.104 align:middle line:84%
that calls the foul
before you make the foul.

00:11:26.104 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It says, hey, don't do that.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't steal.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't act incorrectly
towards another person.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't step off that line.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Be a good, decent
person, because even

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
though you think no one is
watching, someone always is.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And whether you
want to call it God

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or whether you want to call it
a higher power, whether you want

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.995 align:middle line:84%
to call it your guardian angel,
whether you call it karma,

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.939 align:middle line:84%
there's someone always
watching you, taking

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:90%
into account what you do.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.021 align:middle line:90%
And it's not big brother.

00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:50.505 align:middle line:84%
It's not a new world
order and illuminati

00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
terms that people

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
like to associate the
all-seeing eye with.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.407 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful
lesson that says,

00:11:55.407 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know, someone
else-- something else

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
is watching over you, so
watch what you do and do good.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>Certainly.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, there
is the positive path

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:90%
to all these symbols.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.434 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I've heard it said
that not every Mason is

00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
an important person, but just
about every important person

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
you see, whether it's in
politics in particular,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
is a Mason.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.862 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
resonate to you?

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>I would disagree,
because I think

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of important
people in the world that

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
aren't Mason.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I think
every person in the world

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.030 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think one person is
more important than another.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.919 align:middle line:84%
It's just your perception
of how important

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%
you think that person is.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.435 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your perception
may be that the President

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of the United States is the most
important person in the world.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:90%
But is he really?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your personal
world-- in my personal world,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the most important people
to me are my wife and child,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
not the president of the US
and not the prime minister

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
of Australia, where I come from.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.108 align:middle line:84%
So it's only your
perception of who

00:12:45.108 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
you think are the most
important people in the world.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, there
have been a lot

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of important and
influential people

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
who have been Freemasons
over the years,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:84%
from presidents to pop stars to
billionaires to entrepreneurs

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.085 align:middle line:84%
to astronauts to film stars
to athletes, et cetera.

00:13:00.085 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
just as many if not

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
more who have not been
Freemasons over the years.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So it all comes down
to your perception.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Arguably.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would say that
when it comes to government

00:13:08.756 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
administrators, there is a
tremendous fraternity within it

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that does indicate Masonic
initiation and relationships,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
even down to Masonic Bibles
where the oath of office

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
gets taken for presidents, for
example, on Masonic Bibles.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.873 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, that's because the first
president, George Washington,

00:13:24.873 --> 00:13:27.599 align:middle line:84%
was a Freemason, so he took
his oath on his Masonic Bible,

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's a tradition
that's carried over.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.806 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a beautiful
tradition that's carried over

00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:34.789 align:middle line:90%
to the current president.

00:13:34.789 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I think
there are probably

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Masons
within the government.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of golfers in
there too, a lot of Christians

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:90%
in there too.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>But what I'm trying
to get at, though--

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>There's people from
all different walks

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:90%
of life in there.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>My point is simply, why is it
that if we talk about Masonry

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
as far as the positive
aspirations of what it's

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
meant to be about,
and yet we see so many

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
of these administrators,
be it judges, politicians,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Congresspeople,
who are initiated,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
why is it that they don't
follow that notion of being

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
incorruptible and
being a positive force?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
We do see so much
corruption and frankly

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:90%
elitism from these people.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think it's
very unfortunate.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's always
going to be bad apples that

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
are going to ruin a bunch.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can't point
to one or two people

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:84%
or even a handful
of people and then

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.481 align:middle line:84%
point to a whole fraternity
like Freemasonry that

00:14:21.481 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
has some 6 million
members worldwide

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.456 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, because of this
bad apple or that bad apple,

00:14:26.456 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the whole bunch of
them are bad apples.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.496 align:middle line:84%
Like I said,
otherwise we could do

00:14:29.496 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that for virtually any
organization in the world.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.673 align:middle line:84%
But what I've understood is
that people would say, look,

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:84%
the problem we get
into is that because

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of the fraternal nature of it
and the notion of basically

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%
protecting your brothers
within the Order,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes the corruption
of just a handful

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is enough to be protected
by the entire organization,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
because when it comes to
any kind of court process

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.624 align:middle line:84%
or any type of dissemination
of the information,

00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
the Brotherhood
has to basically--

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
the brothers between themselves
will cover each other,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
watch each other's
back, essentially.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, again, I
see that happening

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:90%
in various organizations.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
If you know that someone has an
affinity of something similar

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.104 align:middle line:84%
that you do, you'll be more
likely to protect that person

00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
or choose that
person over someone

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.311 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
the same affinity with.

00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I'm interviewing
two people for a job,

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
let's say, and both
are equally qualified

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.635 align:middle line:84%
but one is a Freemason--
I mean, the qualifications

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:90%
are equally the same.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
They could both
perform the task given

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to the exact same requirement
and they're both lovely people,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.064 align:middle line:84%
but one is a Freemason, I
guess I might give him the job,

00:15:34.064 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:90%
because you know what?

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.625 align:middle line:90%
I have a similarity with him?

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:37.425 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:15:37.425 --> 00:15:39.523 align:middle line:84%
>>Same if I was into
golf and he was a golfer.

00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:41.647 align:middle line:84%
Then I've got a more common
talking point with him,

00:15:41.647 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
so I'll favor him
and give him the job.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.087 align:middle line:84%
Now, those that abuse their
power, as you were stating--

00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what
you were getting at.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And those that abuse that
power and are elitist and do

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
do to the whole backscratching
and do cover up any crimes

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.332 align:middle line:84%
and they may be Freemasons are
breaking a Masonic obligation.

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And as I said,
these are bad apples

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that are spoiling the rest of
the bunch for everyone else

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.989 align:middle line:84%
and giving the
fraternity a bad rap

00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
because they are breaking

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
their obligations they've taken,
which obviously don't mean much

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:84%
They got into Freemasonry to
better their social status,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:84%
better their careers, which is
not the reason to get into it.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And whenever people
petition our lodge,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
we are always warning
them against that.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't come here to make money.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't come here to
improve your social status

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.742 align:middle line:84%
and think that you
can network amongst us

00:16:23.742 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and get jobs and get
favors done for you.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not what it's about.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And obviously there
have been people

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
who don't take that advice
and break their obligation.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>So what is Masonry's
ultimate goal, would you say?

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
What is it really
about to be a Mason?

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.364 align:middle line:84%
Obviously I know
all it takes to be

00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
a Mason is to be a good
man as a prerequisite.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But what is the actual
goal of Masonry?

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>There is a little
bit more to be

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.547 align:middle line:90%
a Mason than being a good man.

00:16:44.547 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And yes, Freemasonry doesn't
make good man better,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.067 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make bad men good.

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
You also need to believe
in a supreme being.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't be an atheist
and be a Freemason.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.696 align:middle line:84%
And I think once you
become a Freemason,

00:16:53.696 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:90%
it's very obvious as to why.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to be
of legal age as well.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of
Freemason lodges don't

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
make women Masons,
so for men only,

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
which is another
issue altogether.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think at the
guts of it, Freemasonry

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
is, as I said earlier, a
path of self-improvement,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:90%
really what it's about.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's one of many paths
to self-improvement

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
you can choose in life that all
go to that same destination,

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to try and transcend above
your material, your brute self,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
your animal nature and
become closer to the source,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
closer to God, closer
to your spiritual side

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
to become the best
person you can be.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>But then what
would you make then

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of the sort of-- how do you
say-- the religious orientation

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
when you get writings
like Albert Pike,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
obviously one of the
supreme lights of you

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
know Scottish Rite
masonry in America,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and you know he talks
about the degrees

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and how basically at
the higher levels,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.961 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize that
the earlier-- higher levels

00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
understand things that
the earlier levels didn't

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
understand, and coming to this
notion of basically Lucifer

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.525 align:middle line:84%
is the real god and
Jehovah is the devil god.

00:17:56.525 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you make of--

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>Albert Pike never said
that Lucifer is the real god.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.853 align:middle line:84%
So Albert Pike, you're talking
about "Morals and Dogma," which

00:18:02.853 --> 00:18:05.084 align:middle line:90%
is a big book in Freemasonry.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's a disclaimer also at
the start of "Morals and Dogma"

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.254 align:middle line:84%
that says-- I'm paraphrasing
here, because I haven't read

00:18:10.254 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Morals and Dogma in a while.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.045 align:middle line:84%
That's a hell of a
book to get through.

00:18:13.045 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And basically it says, take
from Albert Pike's writing

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:90%
what you want.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.048 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to believe it.

00:18:18.048 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
Albert Pike's thoughts.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what Albert Pike wrote
I don't agree with at all.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what he
wrote was fantastic.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>And certainly he was racist.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And he has all kinds
of problems, obviously.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a big background
on Albert Pike

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:90%
you can research into.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.803 align:middle line:84%
The whole of Lucifer
thing, though, he never

00:18:32.803 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:90%
said Lucifer was God.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
Albert Pike said

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
was a Luciferian energy--
that Freemasons look

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.399 align:middle line:84%
for the Luciferian energy or the
"saving energies of Lucifer" I

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
think are the words that he
used in "Morals and Dogma."

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got to
remember that Lucifer

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
in its original Roman word means
the light, the light-bearer.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer was never meant to
be taken as a bad thing.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It was always meant to
be taken as a good thing.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.725 align:middle line:84%
So originally, when Lucifer I
think first appears in the book

00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of Isaiah in the Bible-- and
even that should give you

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a hint, because obviously the
Bible's written in a language

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't Roman, whereas
Lucifer being a Roman term

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
cannot date take back that
far to the original writing

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:90%
of Isaiah.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It was originally
about a fallen king,

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.295 align:middle line:90%
I believe, a Babylonian king.

00:19:18.295 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then Lucifer got taken on
as this fallen angel, which

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:90%
came to believe to be Satan.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Lucifer means the light-bearer.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.198 align:middle line:84%
This was what Albert
Pike was getting at.

00:19:27.198 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And in Masonry, the only thing
a Freemason ever asks for, Sean,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
in all the three degrees
of Freemasonry is light.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Lights in Masonry,
more light in Masonry,

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:90%
further light in Masonry.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Light means knowledge.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Light is what
breaks the darkness.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Light is what breaks the evil.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So Lucifer representing
the first light,

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
being the false light, which
is the planet Venus that

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
rises in dawn just before the
sun, it hails the false light.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:90%
The sun's the real light.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's what
first breaks the darkness.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.054 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing bad about that.

00:19:57.054 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>It's Promethean, actually.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.185 align:middle line:84%
It really could be modeled
on Prometheus, right?

00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>Modeled on Prometheus.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.278 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing
bad about that.

00:20:02.278 --> 00:20:06.364 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete antithesis of
what we presume evil to be.

00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
people have taken

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
what Pike said about Lucifer
and turned it into something bad

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is erroneous, because
really what he's saying

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:90%
is Lucifer breaks the darkness.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.415 align:middle line:84%
Everything darkness
represents, evil,

00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
all the evils of the
world-- because darkness

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.924 align:middle line:84%
was the first great
evil for the ancients.

00:20:21.924 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
When they couldn't
see at night and they

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.567 align:middle line:84%
could be the target
for prey coming at them

00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't see
where they were going,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that was the first great evil.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the light was
broken by the Lucifer,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
by the planet Venus rising
before the great light,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%
the sun.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So really, he's saying
something very good.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.052 align:middle line:84%
But it's being interpreted
as something very bad.

00:20:40.052 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Do I think Albert Pike
could have used a better

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:90%
word than Lucifer?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It would have saved us
Freemasons almost 200 years

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of having these
sort of discussions

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and trying to justify
what Albert Pike wrote.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's the word
he chose to use.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.026 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to put
it in the right context

00:20:55.026 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and understand why
he said Lucifer.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But it still seems
to me like I can't

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
believe that Masonry's
only agenda is

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to make good men better
or to basically be

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:90%
a fraternity for good people.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.006 align:middle line:84%
>>What do you think
the agenda is?

00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, for example,
let's take this.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We know the Masons were--
most of the founding fathers

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
were Masons.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And they put into, for example,
the great seal the symbolism,

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:84%
the notion of a
Novus ordo seclorum,

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.311 align:middle line:84%
or a new order for the ages
or a new secular order.

00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
According to Manly
Hall, America was

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be the beacon for
democracy, which is basically

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.095 align:middle line:84%
what the agenda of the ancient
secret societies is about,

00:21:27.095 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is spreading democracy as
one of the principles, one

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:90%
of the philosophies, right?

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the nature
of the grid system of DC,

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for example, Masonic
architecture all over,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
bringing the obelisk
into DC, into New York,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
obviously very important symbols
that have been placed here.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So it makes me have
to ask, what do you

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:84%
think-- because
some people say it's

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
about constructing the third
temple of Solomon, for example,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.017 align:middle line:84%
But what is the
agenda in your study?

00:21:55.017 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>It is building a third temple
of Solomon, but not in the way

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:84%
you think, not a
physical temple.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Freemasons are taught
that you are the temple.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The temple that was torn
down, was destroyed,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:90%
you are rebuilding.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
You are the temple.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.528 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you're
using these working tools

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
of Freemasonry, the gavel,
the chisel, the 24-inch gauge,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:84%
the plumb, the level, all
the so-called working tools

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of Freemasonry to
build yourself.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:90%
You are the temple.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And they considered
Solomon's Temple,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
which was built-- what was
it, like 4000 BC, 5000 BC?

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
They considered that to be the
most beautiful structure ever

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.212 align:middle line:84%
built, or at least
up until that time.

00:22:30.212 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And as a beautiful structure,
the most beautiful structure,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the most beautiful being
ever built in history

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:90%
is the human being.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, when your
disconnection from the source

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
happened, when you fell
from being a pure person,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.640 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to attain that
level of pureness again.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.486 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to attain your
higher consciousness, become

00:22:47.486 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the best person you can be.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.346 align:middle line:90%
You're rebuilding the temple.

00:22:50.346 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physical temple.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.428 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to see
a physical temple being

00:22:53.428 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
built in Jerusalem again, or
in Washington, DC, or wherever

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
You are the temple and you
are rebuilding that temple.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Washington, DC
was designed a lot by Masonic

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:90%
architectures, well, sure.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, they chose to
leave the symbols behind,

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.726 align:middle line:84%
as the medieval
stone masons did.

00:23:08.726 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll see mason's
marks on a lot

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
of the buildings
throughout Europe

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that these were built by
stone masons, by masons.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Before they were
speculative Masons,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%
they were operative masons.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's no great agenda
there, though.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no great agenda to
try to indoctrinate people

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:90%
in anything.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget,
Sean, also, that people

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:84%
may look at a pyramid
with an all-seeing eye

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and may look at an obelisk--
and again, an obelisk is not

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:90%
a Masonic symbol.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.523 align:middle line:90%
It's an ancient Egyptian symbol.

00:23:34.523 --> 00:23:35.607 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Masonic symbol.

00:23:35.607 --> 00:23:37.564 align:middle line:84%
But people might look at
these and think, well,

00:23:37.564 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
something sinister is happening.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But a symbol is only
as powerful, Sean,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
as you choose to let
it have power over you.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
If you choose not to let a
symbol have power over you,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:90%
it's just a drawing.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I could do a drawing of a
triangle for argument's sake,

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.776 align:middle line:84%
Let me do a drawing
of a triangle.

00:23:55.776 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.006 align:middle line:84%
I draw a triangle on
a piece of paper here.

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.504 align:middle line:84%
Now, to a young child
who's just drawn

00:24:06.504 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that-- I'm not a
very good drawer,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
as you can see--
that's a triangle.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.674 align:middle line:90%
I can make a house out of that.

00:24:11.674 --> 00:24:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I can a pyramid out of that.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I could make a
mountain out of that.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what a child sees.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
To a high school
student, they'll

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
see maybe Pythagoras'
theorem, something

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.664 align:middle line:84%
they've studied in geometry
class or in mathematics class.

00:24:23.664 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:84%
To a Freemason,
if I look at that,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:84%
will see an equilateral
triangle, which

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:90%
is perfect in all its parts.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three;
mind, body, and soul,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:90%
representing the perfect man.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, to a Satanist, that's
a thaumaturgic triangle

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
where they can summon spirits
and demons for evil purposes.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.234 align:middle line:84%
If I show this to
your cameraman,

00:24:43.234 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
he's probably thinking,
yeah, it's a triangle,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:90%
it is true, nothing more.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So this can be
empowered depending

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:84%
on your interpretation
of it, but only as

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
much as you allow yourself to
be influenced by that symbol.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.399 align:middle line:84%
But we know from lore and
mythology and history--

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the construction
of the Solomon's Temple

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was done by jinn, by
commanding of jinn or entities,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
what are oftentimes called
demons, but really just

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not they were
used for positive or negative

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
was up to the source who
were commanding them.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And there is something to be
questioned about the nature

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:90%
of ritual in the modern world.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that
when we do ritual

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and we conduct
certain practices,

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it be symbolic, verbal,
that we are evoking entities

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:90%
from a non-physical plane?

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.644 align:middle line:84%
>>I believe when we do
ritual-- and ritual is

00:25:36.644 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
very important in
Freemasonry, as you know.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Ritual forms the
heart of Freemasonry,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because when you do your first,
second, third degree, or any

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.145 align:middle line:84%
of the appending body
degrees, you are always

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:90%
undertaking a ritual.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:51.504 align:middle line:84%
What a ritual does in a
Masonic lodge, in my opinion

00:25:51.504 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
only-- now, there might be other
Masons out there that disagree.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But in my opinion-- and
being master of a lodge

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and I conduct the ritual
every week in my lodge in Las

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Vegas-- is that it raises
the vibration of the lodge.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It puts everyone
from here up to here.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It raises their awareness,
raises their vibration,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
raises their
excitement about what

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is happening in lodge,
and not in a bad way,

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.079 align:middle line:90%
in a very good way.

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget the rituals
are part of everyday life,

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:90%
are part of people's lives.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Even your coming here to the
studio and doing this show,

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.059 align:middle line:90%
you woke up.

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:90%
You went to the bathroom.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
You brushed your teeth.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:90%
You did your hair.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:90%
You had a shower.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You put on your
clothes in a certain.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.316 align:middle line:84%
You ate your
breakfast and you had

00:26:27.316 --> 00:26:29.677 align:middle line:84%
a certain menu you had for
breakfast and a certain way

00:26:29.677 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:90%
you had your coffee.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all ritual.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.872 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you go
do a yoga class,

00:26:33.872 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
you do a martial
arts class, you're

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:90%
undertaking a form of ritual.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry aren't the
soul proprietors of ritual.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>No, not at all.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Everyone uses ritual
every day of their lives,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and for various reasons.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.125 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it's
to help you get

00:26:46.125 --> 00:26:48.587 align:middle line:84%
to a place that is different
from where you began.

00:26:48.587 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't undertake
your morning ritual,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.003 align:middle line:84%
you'd still be lying
in bed right now.

00:26:52.003 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be doing
this interview.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>Sure.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a ritual
nature, but then there

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
are more powerful
rituals than others.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Super Bowl is a more
powerful ritual.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
The Academy Awards is
a more powerful ritual.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>I agree.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that Freemasonry--

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>Inaugurations.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>--is a ritual that is
trying to summon any spirits,

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:84%
summon any negative
forces, anything like that.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.395 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a ritual, a,
puts everyone on the same path.

00:27:12.395 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is doing the same
thing in the lodge room.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
They're having the same
experience, a joint experience.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's that
coming together,

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.391 align:middle line:90%
working together as one unit.

00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Although there might be
30 or 40 of us in lodge,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.335 align:middle line:84%
we're all working
towards the same goal.

00:27:25.335 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We're all working towards
improving ourselves

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:90%
and elevating our consciousness.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our ritual
in Masonic lodge does.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:90%
It opens up that vibration.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>But there is something I've
heard from another 32nd degree

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
master, who said that
within his Masonic Lodge--

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I think he was actually the
grandmaster of it-- the OTO,

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
which is considered
a more Satanic order,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.512 align:middle line:84%
actually had many
of the Masons--

00:27:45.512 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OTO is not Masonic, though.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>They're not Masonic, but
there are Masons-- well, again,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Masonry is an
interesting initiation

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.641 align:middle line:84%
so that they basically-- these
Masons had joined the OTO

00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and were actually practicing
their OTO rituals in the lodge.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Impossible.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>No, because it was done
in secret after hours.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.772 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, then it wasn't
a Masonic ritual.

00:28:02.772 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>It wasn't a Masonic ritual.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It was an OTO ritual.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
My point is, these OTO
practices were being

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
conducted in a Masonic lodge.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think that
this could effectively

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
denigrate the energy of the
Masonic-- of the temple?

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>A, no, I don't believe so.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And b, OTO rituals should not
be practiced in a Masonic lodge.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps--

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>I'm not saying they should be.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying this
is what I've heard.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
areas to perform those.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And so whoever the person
was in charge of that lodge,

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.859 align:middle line:84%
the master of that lodge
who allowed that ritual

00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to be performed in the lodge
should be severely reprimanded,

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
if not suspended or
expelled, because that's

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
a terrible violation of the
lodge, which we consider a very

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:90%
sacred space.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Would it bring in
negative energy?

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it might to them and
the rituals they're doing,

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:84%
but not to the
rituals we're doing.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:84%
We're elevating
our own energies.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.673 align:middle line:84%
We're elevating
our own vibration.

00:28:49.673 --> 00:28:51.298 align:middle line:84%
In our lodge, it's
very, very positive.

00:28:51.298 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
negative about it.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And seeing that all that will
just begin with a prayer-- we

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
begin by dedicating our lodge
to God, to the supreme being,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to the grand architect
of the universe.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Then that is only
if you want to say

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:84%
invoking positive vibrations
for us, no negative vibrations.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So what they had in that
room, they left in that room,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.060 align:middle line:84%
they took with them
out of that room,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with Masonic ritual.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>Fair enough.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply saying
that it's interesting,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
because once you enter this
path of self-awareness,

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:84%
know thyself, self-initiation,
essentially getting

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to a place of understanding
that there is a supreme creator,

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
but we are much more
empowered beings than before,

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes that knowledge
leads to a dark path.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Am I correct, that it
can go to either way?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is perhaps
what we're seeing

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
when we see a lot of
conspiracy theorists say,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.680 align:middle line:90%
well, it's because of Masonry.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I always say
I think Masonry

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
is a form of initiation into
a different understanding

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
of reality beyond the conforms
of your social conditioning,

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:84%
religious conditioning,
and whatnot.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, with that
new awareness and knowledge,

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.080 align:middle line:84%
gnosis in a sense, comes
then the opportunity

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.946 align:middle line:90%
to take two directions with it.

00:30:01.946 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
you do see Masons

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:84%
who are practicing Satanic
ritual and things like OTO,

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Crowley type of rituals
that oftentimes lead

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to more bestial behavior,
because they've empowered

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:84%
themselves and they choose to
use that power for the negative

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:90%
as opposed for the positive.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think you
summed it up very well.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.965 align:middle line:84%
I think you actually answered
your own question pretty well

00:30:18.965 --> 00:30:19.765 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:30:19.765 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's how you choose to
empower the symbolism you're

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.250 align:middle line:84%
learning and the
lessons you're learning,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and whether, as you
said, you go a dark path

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
or you continue
following the path.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:90%
There's dualities in life.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Life is made up of dualities.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.026 align:middle line:84%
You know, the checkered pavement
is another Masonic symbol

00:30:34.026 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that all Masonic lodges
have a checkered floorboard

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.325 align:middle line:90%
of black and white squares.

00:30:37.325 --> 00:30:39.147 align:middle line:84%
That symbolizes the
duality in life.

00:30:39.147 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Try and stay on the
white squares more

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.021 align:middle line:90%
than the black squares in life.

00:30:42.021 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Try and stay in the light
rather than the darkness.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
there are people

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that do take the wrong path.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And these people, if
they get found out

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
in a Masonic lodge, that's
the path they've taken,

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.800 align:middle line:84%
then actions are taken to
remove them from the lodge.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed
in the lodge anymore.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't accept Satan
as a higher being.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.991 align:middle line:90%
It's not a supreme being.

00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:01.975 align:middle line:84%
You can't take an obligation
on a Satanic book in a Masonic

00:31:01.975 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:84%
lodge, because we
don't recognize

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.502 align:middle line:90%
Satan as a supreme being.

00:31:05.502 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
To be a supreme being, you
have to be the big, right?

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.566 align:middle line:84%
>>So we don't recognize Satan
as being more supreme than God.

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>I think it's a
great summation.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me today, Michael.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate the talk.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>Sure, and it's been an
absolute pleasure, mate.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:84%
My pleasure to meet you and
be here on the "Buzzsaw."

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I love the show.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Absolutely.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.144 align:middle line:90%
>>Thank you.

00:31:23.144 --> 00:31:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>And there you have it,
folks, fascinating insights

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:90%
from Michael Schiavello.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:10%
You may not agree with or
believe everything he said here

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.950 align:middle line:10%
today, but I urge you to check
out his book "Know Thyself,"

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:10%
as well as his website,
MichaelSchiavello.net.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the road to
truth is a perilous path

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:90%
along the edge of the buzzsaw.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Sean Stone,
and you are the revolution.
