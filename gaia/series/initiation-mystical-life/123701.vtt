00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.802 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:10%
>>If we were left entirely
to our own devices,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:10%
the natural maturation
process provides us

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:10%
with exactly the
right opportunities

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
for expansion and ascendancy.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Life can be thought of as
divided into seven-year cycles,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
seven-year windows in which
we are given carefully crafted

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
phases of time to cultivate
our understanding of self

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and universe, not
specifics, not necessarily

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.265 align:middle line:84%
any particular images and
details and vocations,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
but themes, energies,
broad themes.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The particular details are
usually quite arbitrary.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
The methods and principles
are what really matter.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So in the course of a
natural spiritual human life,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:90%
we have these seven-year cycles.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether we
acknowledge it or not,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
local, planetary, solar,
and universal influences

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
are constantly
shaping and energizing

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:90%
these phases of growth.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Energizing is the key word.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
This is one good way
to interpret them.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Allow me to share this with you.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:10%
From zero years of age
to seven years of age,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:10%
really the first
seven years of life

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
are the most delightful
and cherished.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we're in a
state of purity, perfectly

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
free from also soul
work for many years.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:90%
How lovely.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Soul does not even come
in for a good while.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
We play.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:90%
We explore.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
We acclimate to our new
surroundings and family,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and if we have
chosen it to be, we

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
begin the processes of
strengthening ourselves

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
for the coming trials
and challenges.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It is ironic that in
this state of purity,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
we find the seeds of our
deepest courage for later.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet when we are in
those first seven years,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
the clear bliss
and unbounded joy

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
are really one of the
loveliest parts of life.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:10%
Seven to 14, that
next cycle-- this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:10%
is the period when
self develops.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:10%
Self begins to shape itself
and manifest all our own unique

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:10%
characteristics.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
There are many
constituents to this.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Somehow our self arises from
our blood lineage, our tribe,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:90%
our heart, our bones.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of the self is
our own invention,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
portrayed, not defined by, the
artistry of our personality.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And when there is the other
more esoteric of self,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
then we really start
to appreciate there

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:90%
is a transtemporal element.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
That is our inner
core being transcends

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the lifetime of
this one individual

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and is more properly considered
an emanation from soul,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
embodying many aspects
from prior lives.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Things we need to work
on present themselves.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Strengths-- we have spent
many eons refining contours,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
theaters of conflict
that we have previously

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
run away from begin once more to
establish themselves and demand

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:90%
our attention.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:10%
14 to 21-- outward observation.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:10%
Here, we begin to seriously
examine the world around us--

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:10%
what it is, what it's
for, how it influences

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:10%
us, and necessarily high up on
the subject of our observations

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:10%
is the behavior of our
fellow human beings.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers know how
crap most people

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.305 align:middle line:84%
are, what rubbish the
grownups have settled for.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
For the young observer, many
competing energies powerfully

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
interweave for the first
time-- intellect, sensitivity,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
sensuality, creativity, love,
higher aspirations, and also

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
the negative mappings of
depression and anxiety,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:90%
separation and loss.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
the wise elders

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
would provide wise
and loving guidance

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
through this very key
developmental phase and gift

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
them, these young people,
with sacred knowledge

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.699 align:middle line:84%
that brought balance and truth
and healing and fortitude.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:10%
21 to 28-- inward observation.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:10%
This is where the journey
of spiritual development

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:10%
really begins to
gain some traction.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the age where the inner
refinement is really tested.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:10%
Contemporary society
has no place for young,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:10%
spiritually evolving
men and women.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We see examples, of course,
of lip service and pretense,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but true inward observation
is actually discouraged.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You see, for society which
seeks to control its subjects,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
inward observation
in a human being

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
is a disaster, because it leads
to a very revolutionary kind

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:90%
of freedom, outward reformation.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:10%
This leads to the
next phase, 28 to 35.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:10%
This outward
reformation-- what is it?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:10%
This is the stage where
we would ordinarily

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:10%
begin to shape our outward
life to fit our inward journey.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We reconcile the necessary
adventures inside and out.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:90%
We travel.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:90%
We make sanctuary.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
We engage with the
most significant parts

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of life, periods of
exhilarating mobility

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and pioneering
natural anthropology

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
as we walk through the world
and adapt our behaviors

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to what we see around
us-- the people,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:90%
the things, the customs.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Periods of sanctuary,
where we take our rest

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
and contemplation.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We grasp the dynamite power
of silence and stillness.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
We affiliate ourselves with
other spiritual tribesmen

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
who are doing the same as us
with honor, determination,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and skill.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are
periods of engagement

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
where we throw ourselves
into the hubbub,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
into projects and work,
study and art, craftsmanship,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
into discovery and refinement,
people, communities,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
building, setting down
new foundations for better

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:90%
ways of living and growing.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:10%
35 to 42 brings us to
inward reformation.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:10%
Here, in this seven-year
period, we change the inside.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
We work to resolve
the old circuits that

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:90%
no longer serve us.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We design new modes of
perception and response,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
new formulas of
interaction and engagement,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and bring an overall
equilibrium to the inner life

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that is absolutely
essential to the furtherance

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:10%
In a very keen way,
this is the time

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:10%
when the giant monolith of self
is sculpted and refined down

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:10%
to a much simpler
and more subtle form.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The giant cracks, and
globular protuberances

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:90%
are done away with.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:90%
The hard angles are smoother.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The beauty is cultivated
as best we can.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:84%
We begin to value
grace in our being.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
We see that treading
lightly is the key

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:90%
to the mastery of inner power.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.265 align:middle line:84%
We finally internalize
the knowing

00:07:24.265 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that having a big
improperly positioned ego

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:90%
blocks access to high wisdom.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The universe doesn't
share with blabber mouths

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and chest beaters, however
clever or driven they are.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:90%
We learn humility.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.405 align:middle line:84%
We cross the threshold
of self control.

00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:10%
42 to 49-- outward being.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:10%
This is where we begin to knock
the outside world into shape.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
With the accumulation of all
the prior wisdom and experiences

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
we have behind us,
we can now begin

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
to specify how it is
that we wish to live,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%
how we wish to be.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
What are the components
of that life?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Who is in it?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Who is not in it?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
How are we known?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:90%
What do we not do?

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:84%
How do we know other people
and beings and experiences?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
What occasion do we provide
for ourselves to be?

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
that is necessary.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Typically, at this
time in life, we

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:84%
have the first real
visceral gratitude

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:90%
for peace and balance.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
How we conduct ourselves, how
we move and speak and love

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:90%
become incredibly important.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:10%
Inward being, 49 to
56 years of age--

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:10%
this is where the power comes.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:10%
You will notice the pattern
through these stages

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.702 align:middle line:10%
outward, inward, outward,
inward, outward, inward.

00:08:53.702 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It is always during the inward
expression of a growth phase

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that the real substance
and teaching of our wisdom

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
can be most
effectively integrated.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It is the integration that
brings adeptness and power.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It is a good thing if these
years are calm and deep, slow,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:90%
and joyful.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Not a time to be running
around being massively busy.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
These things do not
represent success

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual man,
the spiritual woman.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a most
valuable skill to be

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
able to design a life,
which is being set up

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.980 align:middle line:84%
through that reformational
period, 28 to 42,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that accommodates
our choice to change

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%
the velocity of our inquiry.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Slowness brings
quality through depth.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Speed brings quantity
through distance.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:10%
56 to 63, outward
ascendancy-- this stage

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:10%
represents the bearing of
fruit from all our hard work

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:10%
and labor, all those years, the
transformational phase where

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:10%
the old clockwork
of the human being

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:10%
is for the first
time transcended.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:90%
We become master of ourselves.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Self is ours to use as a
beautiful instrument for growth

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and creation and exploration.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
We truly govern ourselves
with wisdom and grace.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:10%
63 to 70-- finally,
inward ascendancy.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:10%
The culmination of all our work
prepares the vessel for exit.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether the individual decides
to stay for another 20 or 40

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
or 500 years is up
to them, but this

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
is the period of the deepest joy
in life, an illuminated return

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
to the purity of that first
cycle so long ago in our lives

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.830 align:middle line:84%
when we were two,
five years old.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:90%
We refine and craft and be.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
The threshold has been
crossed, and the work is done.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Harvest is in.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Now it is time to
celebrate and make

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
joyful preparations for the next
journey, to see our loved ones,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to rally with our
tribal ancestors

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
we have not seen
for generations,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to rest in the heavenly
realms, to regenerate,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
to ascend homewards for a time.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Consider these seven-year
cycle carefully.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Look at the big
crossroads in your life,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and you will see that they most
frequently occur at the endings

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and beginnings of these cycles.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Are these not natural stages of
initiation that life gifts us

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
If only we can collect
ourselves, take a moment,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and be still enough to recognize
them, then they have value.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Do join me next time.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
