>>When I was a young
boy in England,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
there was a
television commercial

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that helped to instruct
the young children in how

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to cross the road safely,
crossing the street.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
It was called "The Green Cross
Code," which asked everyone

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.409 align:middle line:10%
crossing a street, first of
all, to stop, look, and listen.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
most important thing

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to ensure we traversed
the road safely.

>>That wasn't very
clever, was it?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
If you'd been looking and
listening all the way across,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't have happened.

>>Today, for us, in
deeper considerations

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of life and spiritual
reality, this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is still most excellent
advice I find,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:84%
because if we forget to
stop and look and listen,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:90%
we miss things.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
We risk undervaluing ourselves.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:90%
We tend to misconceive reality.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Always being busy affords us
very little time to contemplate

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
anything big or small.

Although it is
tacitly understood

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
to be a sign of a

in spiritual
development, being busy

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:90%
all the time is no good at all.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We are miscalculating if
we are doing it habitually.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We need to cultivate a
contemplative state of being--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
being as a daily practice.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
As well as being able to do
and process and articulate

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.440 align:middle line:84%
an action, we must be able
to step back, take a moment,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.555 align:middle line:84%
bring our hands together,
breathe, and do nothing.

nothing arises a truth,

whatever is in front of us.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:90%
If we are busy, we miss it.

faculty is essential

Whatever we are,
whatever we are doing,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.724 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing else
that we ought to be doing.

Now if we have
made an appointment

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.625 align:middle line:84%
to meet with a friend for
dinner or catch a train

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
or deliver a baby or
go to the theater,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that is rather a
different thing.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But I mean nine out
of 10 times when

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
we are going about
our general business

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
in the world, when we
are doing things in life.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You see, many people have
this nagging suspicion

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in the back of their heads that
they should be doing something

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
more productive, something
that delivers a greater yield

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
or has a tangible product,
something different to what

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:90%
they're currently doing.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly
prevalent if we

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
are doing things that
are not typically

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
what we'd call work, things
without commercial value--

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
being in the garden, drawing
the clouds in the sky,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
watching the hawks in the
woods, reading old poetry.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
All the while in the
background, for many people,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
there is a vague sensation
that something is wrong.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They should be doing something
more structured that actually

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
produces a formal development
or product or service,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%
a task with a measured outcome.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
things that matter.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Aren't they just the only
things that really count?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual development
tells us, of course,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:90%
that this is all hogwash.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It is a silly fantasy
propagated by empire

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to keep people showing up to
the offices and their factories.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It comes, it derives from a
very dysfunctional distortion

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
of the original
Protestant work ethic,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
from a time when hard
work was considered godly,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:90%
which it certainly can be.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the lack of productivity
was equated with idleness,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:90%
which was devilish.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
To not work was
sinful, and it had

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to be a formally
sanctioned kind of work,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
not just any old thing.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
The global economic system
still supports this very harmful

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
model, so whilst
long ago, it might

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
have been true that unless
you were doing something

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
useful on the wagon
train, you were

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.015 align:middle line:84%
dead weight and a burden
to your companions, today

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that is largely irrelevant.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So what about when we have
satisfied the responsibilities

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:90%
that we've created in life?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
What about when everything
is in satisfactory order

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to our own personal approval?

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There is no indebtedness of
any kind, no obligations,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
no chores, no duties.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Can we be OK doing
nothing, to simply be?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Or do we still secretly
feel that we should be doing

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:90%
something more constructive?

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Have we been so indoctrinated
that the idea of doing nothing

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
feels like we are committing
a quiet but unseemly crime?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
What if the truth is
that no one on the planet

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
can possibly determine the value
of what you were doing or not

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:90%
doing?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
What if there really
is no official arbiter

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of the price of our actions?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
What if, indeed, all our
actions have equal value,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
whether we are washing clothes
with stones at the river

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
or tapping keyboards
in Wall Street?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
What if it were all
the same in the end?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
What if we didn't have
to do anything at all?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
All we had to do was to
choose what responsibilities

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
we wanted, who we wanted to
be with, what time we needed

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:84%
What if nothingness is part
of a genuine human life,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that, indeed, long
periods of nothingness

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
are a significant part of
our spiritual development?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.766 align:middle line:84%
There are many things
that we could be doing.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But there is nothing
that we should be doing.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Only we ourselves can determine
the appropriateness of what we

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:90%
are doing in any given moment.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
One moment is rather the
same as another, is it not?

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:90%
What we do with it is up to us.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Strictly speaking at the
super zoomed out level,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
there is no wrong or right
on this, only choice.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The greatest ignorance
is to believe

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that we have no choice,
the great crime,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:84%
or to be corralled
into choosing unwisely

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
what we do with our life, to
do things we don't want to do,

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
things we are not good at,
things we care very little for.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
This would be a very sad
and unnecessary waste

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of our precious time.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.490 align:middle line:84%
We need to be very aware of
this, especially young people,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
like the children who were asked
to stop and look and listen.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, that should
continue throughout life.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It can help us to decide things
with forethought and insight

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to make good choices,
and every time something

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
goes horribly wrong,
we see that it is often

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:84%
throughout our own
unwise choices.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Every choice has a payload.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Every rash and ignorant
decision will bring consequences

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:90%
every time.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Every excellent
and wise decision

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
will bring harmony and
abundance to our door.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
There is no randomness
here, no coincidence,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:90%
no look, just choice.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Life is open.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
All of it is accessible
to all of us.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We may start far from
the core of what we want,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
but nobody stops us from taking
whatever pathway we want,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:90%
except ourselves.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
The only restrictions
are the ones

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
we consent to, especially at
that time of the fourth cycle,

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:90%
21 years of age.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It all opens up.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing limiting us
that we have not agreed to

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and summoned into our
circle of experience.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
If your life is full
of confusion and pain,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:90%
you made it that way.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
If your life is
lucid and fulfilling,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:90%
you made it that way.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether the waves of life
soothe you or loom over

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you is decided by the
fidelity of your consciousness

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:90%
and your willingness to grow.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
We image things into being by
either concealing ourselves

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
from reality or by
meeting it head on.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Most people spend their
lives strategizing to conceal

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
themselves from the world.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
For the spiritually alive human
being, this isn't acceptable.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Full and unreserved
engagement is the only way

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:90%
to willfully shape reality.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely the
case that we magnetize

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
what we need into our
life-- dysfunction

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and agony just as much
as harmony and elation.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
There are no wrongdoings
or karmic penances,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:90%
nothing of the sort.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We bring to us what
we want to examine.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a reminder of the
curriculum we asked for.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
If we want to examine
a disease, we get it.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.686 align:middle line:84%
We want to examine
love, we fall into it.

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
If we want to
resolve aggression,

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
we must first embody it
before we can transmute it.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
To know art, it most
flow in our dreams

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
before it can flow
into our paint.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:90%
We live it, dream it, bleed it.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
For those who knowingly
mix their seed and egg

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of new entities,
this is what you chose to do.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
However apparently
planned or unplanned,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
the presence of children
is always as it must be.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
If you go over Niagara Falls
in a barrel or win $10 million

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:90%
in Las Vegas, you chose it.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:90%
No randomness.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Our laughter and our tears
allow us to materialize.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can ever force
it, unless we allow it.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
To stop and look
and listen gives us

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the silence and stillness
for wisdom to arise.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
In a state a faultless,
natural human serenity,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:84%
we see things with
a degree of clarity

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
that can never be achieved
amid the frantic knowings

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of complex doings.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We bring into sharp
focus that very question.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:90%
What are we supposed to do?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Are we supposed to do
something in particular?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We could be a cellist, a
surgeon, a yoga teacher,

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
a parent, an accountant, a
carpenter, or just someone

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.775 align:middle line:90%
walking in the wilderness.

00:10:53.775 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Are those things wildly
different in value?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Philosophically speaking,
do any of these callings

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
have any greater inherent
worth than any of the others?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no, they do not.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Now if you want to listen to the
cello being played exquisitely,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
there are few things
better than to listen

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to a virtuoso player performing
Bach live in a German concert

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
hall.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
If you need a vulgar little
tumor removed from your body,

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
a skilled surgeon is
really a marvelous thing.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
To learn yoga is so much
more fun and effective

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and satisfying with a
skilled teacher in the room

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%
to properly instruct you.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:90%
To be a parent-- goodness me.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
What a life of
learning that entails.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
What wisdom is exchanged
between infant and adult.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And all the other things we
might do to shape numbers,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to shape wood, to explore
the ancient streets

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
of an old European city,
to take photographs,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to write a brilliant novel--
what do these things add up to

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmic order?

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Many people want to discover
what their thing is,

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:90%
their special, unique passion.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:90%
This is me.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what I do.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
This is what I am.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they
think, knowing this,

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
then they'll be ready, ready to
finally grasp life, really go

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:90%
for it, to drink long and deep.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It seems to them that by
knowing exactly what to do,

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
their achievement
would be great.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:90%
They would have iron will.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They could go
anywhere, do anything,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and really leave a mark in
life that makes a difference.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And this implies the
reverse situation, too.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
What if you're not doing what
you're supposed to be doing?

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:90%
What if you've got it wrong?

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Are you wasting time and life?

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you forfeited
your magical gifts?

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you horribly off track?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.160 align:middle line:84%
How on earth do we know what
we're supposed to be doing?

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I would like to propose
an answer to you today.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed to do one
thing and one thing only--

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:90%
to witness.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
This is our single
task-- to witness

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
with mind, heart, and will what
is occurring around and through

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.715 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is optional,
arbitrary, and elective.

00:13:13.715 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Witness is it.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people worry that just
witnessing is not enough.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It might seem too passive
or inactive somehow.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:90%
It isn't doing anything.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, do you know what
it means to bear witness?

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It means to show by your very
existence the truth of a thing.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is a
beautiful way to live.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
There could be nothing
more visceral in this life.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Some mystical philosophies
suggest that the creator cannot

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
see here what is being made
by interstellar processes,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, angels,
equations, supernovas, magic,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever miraculous cosmic
cookery you wish for cannot be

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:90%
seen by the creator.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
What is made in the 3D can
only be envisaged fully

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
by sentient beings
embodied in it.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Enmeshed and composed
from its materials,

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
lucid entities chronicle
the dynamics of life.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
They are pilgrims
of the mystery.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Our witnessing is deep,
active, reciprocal.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:90%
As we live, we record.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
As we think, we load our visions
into the universe itself,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
or what is sometimes
referred to as the A field,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
a giant cosmic hard
drive that is embedded

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:90%
into the black space itself.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Every little whisper is heard.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The most subtle
reveries are unspoken.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Ponderings we think are
gone forever are not gone.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The most enormous achievements
hewn into the granite face

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of life, all of them know that
tiny dreams of snoozing voles

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
nestled in oak leaves, the
exquisite articulations

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of giant blue whales gliding
through the Pacific Ocean.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
All of it, all of
these witnesses

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:90%
are seen, valued, cherished.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We are treasured in the
nations of the divine.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
We live and see.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:90%
This is what we do.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:90%
This is our job.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
The deeper we look
into ourselves,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
the deeper we can look
into the cosmos being

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:90%
greater servants of the divine.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, one
revolution of a million

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
stars later, we go home and
turn the pages of our adventure

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and offer our utterly distinct
and perfectly singular

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
testimony.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
To really witness a thing we
have to become merged with it.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
To know its root, we have
to interweave our root.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:90%
We go to our origins together.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Do join me next time.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:90%
