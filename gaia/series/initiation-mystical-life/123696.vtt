00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>>The most revolutionary and
beautiful adventure of all

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
is to choose a life of
spiritual development.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
How fascinating and curious it
is to pour our precious time

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and efforts into this
most mysterious of ways,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
which is practically invisible
to the mainstream world.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So what exactly is meant
by spiritual development?

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, spiritual, pertaining to
spirit, spirit, a vital force

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
within the person
that gives them

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
life, energy, and
power, and inequality,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
the non-physical essence
of a sentient being.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So to develop this
spirit is, of course,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
to grow it and advance it,
but more than anything,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to understand its nature, to
comprehend its relationship

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
to the deeper reality around us.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
What an intriguing
decision to give one's life

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:90%
to this esoteric art.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
It is a very romantic
and obscure thing to do,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel, especially within
the technology saturated

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:90%
corridors of the 21st century.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
In this globalist culture
that defines itself

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
through a pervasive commerce
and a mandatory mercantile

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:84%
mode of behavior, how
remarkable and radical

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
it then is to focus on
spirit, to dedicate oneself

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to something that offers no
tangible products or services.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
There are no formal
qualifications

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
for spiritual
development, not really.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
At root, it is not even a
philosophical or theological

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
inquiry in the strictest sense.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It is something else, and
you can't just use one system

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
or modality to articulate it.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
No Buddhist or
Hermeticist or Christian

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
or shaman, psychologist
or Kabbalist, physicist

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
or astronomer has enough
within their specialist field

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
to properly elucidate it.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom must necessarily
come from many places.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, to specialize
too much in one area

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:90%
can be a distinct disadvantage.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So a life of
authentic spirituality

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
requires of everyone the
attitude and capacity

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of a Renaissance man or woman,
or as we would say today,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
a polymath, someone
with expertise and skill

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in many diverse disciplines,
different yet complementary

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:90%
bodies of knowledge.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We are often asked in our
spiritual endeavours to bring

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
together many
disparate data points,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to paint a picture that only
a person learned in both art

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and science can see, someone who
has the poetic impulse as much

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:90%
as they have the engineer's eye.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
All these skills and techniques
and studies-- how on Earth

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:90%
could fit them in?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Will it not burst our brains
to attempt to educate ourselves

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:90%
in all this stuff?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
No, because it is meant to be
spread out over a lifetime.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's meant to be enjoyable.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
This speaks of the
auto-didactic impulse.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the commitment
to educate oneself,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to educate oneself throughout
life to be a life-long learner.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And this sets the stage for
us to cultivate a deep insight

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
into the relationship
between ourselves

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and the wider
universe around us,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to look deeply into
its profound nature

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and take ourselves
seriously enough to ask

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:90%
the big ontological questions.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Who am i?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Where did I come from?

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:90%
What am I best to do?

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:90%
What is this life for?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:84%
In addressing these
things, we cease

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to live for mere
diversions and pleasures,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and instead live for growth.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the indelible mark
of all spiritual students,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and it is here that we also
encounter the word "mystic,"

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
a mystic being someone simply
who seeks to engage directly

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
with a higher order of reality
or state of being or union

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:90%
with divinity.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism is a discipline that
recognizes that greater truths

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
cannot be accessed purely
through our reason.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But instead are available
through the transformation

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism values the
experiential over the abstract.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:90%
We do it.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Not just talk about it or think
about it or watch other people

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
do it, so you could say that
all those academic philosophers

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and scrupulous formal
theorists really

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
are offering their own very kind
of abstract expressionist art

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to the world-- highly
subjective and personal,

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
quite legitimate, but not at all
to be confused with depictions

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
of the things that are really
here in the world universally

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:90%
understood.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Such an understanding cannot
be had by reason alone,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
nor by representation.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
We learn how things are only
by directly engaging with them.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a pioneering
business, this.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:90%
It is the work of an artisan.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
The more honestly
and carefully we

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
look into the mechanics
of spiritual development,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:84%
the more we appreciate it is a
very serious enterprise indeed.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would propose to you
it is the most serious thing

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
you can ever do.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet if we take it too
seriously, we kill it.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't take it
seriously enough, we lose it.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So our spiritual refinement
must be comprehended

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
with a certain
delicacy, precision,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
as it is when we hold a
butterfly in our cold hands.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Too hard, and it is dead.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:90%
To soft, and it flies away.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But with the right
balance and guardianship,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
we can intimately observe
a great truth and beauty

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, we share
in something quite sublime

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.859 align:middle line:84%
that tells us about
the nature of reality.

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
In this series of
programs, I'm going

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
to explore with you the wisdom,
the attitudes, the techniques,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and the bearing necessary for
a very individualistic kind

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual development,
which for me is the only way

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
to properly embrace a
healthy, spiritual life.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
We shall examine ways of
metaphysical engagement

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that are life-changing in their
insistence on authenticity.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We will cultivate a rigorous
personal sovereignty

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that opposes all man-made
authority and dogma.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And whilst our
path will certainly

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
intersect with some familiar
spiritual territories,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
always our eye will
be on independence

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and an invigorating
personal liberty

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to inquire into every
and any part of life.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do people come
to spirituality?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I would propose to you
that in the present times,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual development
of a human being

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
does not arise by itself.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary act
of will is necessary.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
People come to
spirituality, because they

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
sense something is
wrong with the world,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
with their life, their world--
something close, something

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
significant, a matter that
is felt deep in the heart.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
There is some warp in the
fabric of their reality

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't make sense.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So when the scientific
and religious

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and medical and
educational establishments

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
fail miserably to
explain what's going on,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
what that distortion is,
the spiritual student

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
begins to take it upon
themselves to investigate.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So the journey begins.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So we come here because we
detect a twist in the tale,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
What can it provide,
this spirituality?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
What is it that they're
looking for, these people?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
What is that we're looking for?

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I would say that people are
looking for solace and meaning,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
initially, things that are
absent from the mainstream

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
paradigm of life
as a [? trader. ?]

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They seek solace to be OK,
to be seen, heard, comforted,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:90%
strengthened.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
To be OK enough to go
on, but is meaning that

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
is the real driver here, the
real motivation for this path.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because only higher
meaning can possibly

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:84%
explain the mystery of why bad
things happen to good people,

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
why some unaccountable
pain manifests,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
why we see withering
diseases, unjust accidents,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:90%
bereavements, and heartbreaks.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it all just random?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.272 align:middle line:84%
Do unpleasant things
just accidentally arise?

00:09:05.272 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
else going on

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are being
beckoned to examine?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So when there is an interruption
in the otherwise smooth

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
routines of life, and our
plans do not go as expected,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:90%
is it just coincidence or not?

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all had the
experience where sometimes we

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
are left with broken
glass in our hands,

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
where once there was
a champagne flute.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.566 align:middle line:84%
Something wonderful
becomes something dreadful.

00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:31.906 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
So we seek deeper answers.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sense of
the apparently senseless.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So meaning is very important
to the lucid human.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We want peace and pleasure
and harmony too, yes.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But the study of meaning is
what brings people close in.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intimate
and exceptional thing

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to say for the first time in
our lives, what is this event?

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:84%
What is this feeling
that breaks me in two?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Why did it happen?

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Not do I like it or dislike it?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Not does it help
me or hinder me?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But instead, purely and
powerfully and quietly,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
An interesting thing
happens at this point.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we have perpetually
led everything with self,

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
we begin to lead with soul,
with our core essence,

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
quite untroubled by human
affairs, serene, deep, old.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Self is interested only in
security and comfort, really.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Those are its main
concerns to feel OK,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:90%
which is understandable.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Soul, on the other hand, is
philosophical in its nature.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It is concerned with purpose
and the true nature of things.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:90%
This is our pathway to meaning.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We can say, therefore, that
at root, spirituality is

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the movement from self to soul.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So with this, the journey
of transformation begins.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.630 align:middle line:84%
We cease to be what we were
for so long for so many years

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:90%
and become something else.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It is notable that
in both mainstream

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric spiritual
systems, we often

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
see some form of initiation,
stages of admittance,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
as it were, to
increasingly powerful,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:90%
profound levels of knowledge.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Why have this initiation?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Why not just tell everyone
the whole thing straight off?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Treat us like adults.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
There are two reasons for
this initiatory process.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:90%
The first reason is this.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
To be involved in what
was once called knowledge

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred mystery is
an exceedingly privileged

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It can change a
person's mind and heart

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
beyond all recognition,
and when properly

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
integrated into
oneself, this knowledge

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.660 align:middle line:84%
can also change external
reality physically.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Physically, the particular
nature of this world

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.710 align:middle line:84%
around goes us and its
default physics shift.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
This sacred knowledge
must, therefore,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
be wisely and
sensitively safeguarded.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So systems were
devised to measure

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
the attainment, the character,
and the merit of a person.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And as that person proved
their readiness for advancement

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
over many years, higher levels
of knowledge and methodology

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
were gladly shared with them.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
The second reason for initiation
was to protect autonomous,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
mystical, and
spiritual groups, who

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
chose not to submit to the
dominating imperial religions

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
2,000 years, this

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
was most particularly evident
with the march of the Roman

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Empire and the enforcement of
their version of Christianity,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:84%
otherwise known as the state
church of the Roman Empire.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Gone were the many centuries
of a plurality of gods

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and the localized worship
of ancestral spirits-- gone.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Christianity became the
one and only faith as

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
defined in 380 AD with
the edict of Thessalonica.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
All subjects of the
Roman Empire had

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to agree to the faith of the
bishops of Rome and Alexandria,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
imposing Nicene Christianity
as the compulsory religion

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.110 align:middle line:90%
of the entire Roman Empire.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Those who did not properly
observe Nicene Christianity

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.050 align:middle line:84%
were exiled or killed,
millions exterminated

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
across England, Germany, Spain,
Portugal, France, Greece,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Belgium, Switzerland, Romania,
Serbia, Turkey, Syria, Iraq,

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and
many other vast countries.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
What an empire.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
For our purposes today, we
must remember and realize

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that at that time, it was
these very same places that

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
constituted the mystical
heartland of the new world.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Many sages and shamans and
druids and outstanding men

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and women of inner excellence
lived and practiced

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:90%
in these places.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of sacred temples,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
which had peacefully served
as mystical focal points

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual
communities of Europe

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and Northern Africa for
countless centuries,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:90%
were obliterated.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Not only were they destroyed.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:90%
They were built upon.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:84%
The powerful, energetic aspects
of the ground, of the earth

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
were sequestered into the
Nicene Christian paradigm.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The land and its potency was
subverted for other purposes,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and so the mystical groups
had to go underground

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to survive the onslaught
of this terrible empire.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Men of deep learning,
high attainment,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and honorable conduct
chose to keep themselves

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
separate from the capricious
affairs and terrible violence

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of ordinary men.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Knowing the staggering
ignorance of the world,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
they protected themselves
and their teachings

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
by concealment, until more
tolerant and enlightened times.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It is sobering to consider
that despite the many problems

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
the world faces today,
we have a higher degree

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of freedom and liberty
in our personal affairs

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.044 align:middle line:90%
than they ever did.

00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a very recent thing.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Only 200 years
ago, we were still

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
executing people, human
beings, for what was pitifully

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
referred to as witchcraft.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
This simply being
a word to describe

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
rural, spiritual practices that
were different to Christianity,

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Roman Christianity.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Heresy was and
still is punished.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The punishment in the
West today is ridicule.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In more savage lands,
it is still death.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So privacy and
secrecy exist even

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
in this most modern and
progressive of mystical orders.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Secrets that were originally
designed to help teach

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
were now wrapped
in more secrets.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, today in a world
where everything is so instantly

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
accessible and on demand,
unraveling this secrecy

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
is beyond most
people's patience.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It is a hidden box in a hidden
room in an unknown house.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
No directions, no map, no
compass, no flashlight,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:90%
no nothing.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So for these reasons
alone, we can

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
begin to appreciate why the
esoteric layer is always

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
very important in
spiritual development.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
To know the meaning of why
things are hidden is important.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Esotericism cannot be altogether
dispensed with if we are

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:90%
serious in our undertakings.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:90%
This will change in time.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But for now, we need
to understand it

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
as a part of our
spiritual training.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Different mystical
schools and traditions

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
had and have different methods
categorization and measurement

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:90%
for sharing that knowledge.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Many have 10 key stages,
10 main initiatory phases.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Some are 35.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Some, 77.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:10%
If we were to super distill
all these systems down

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:10%
to their very core
nature, we could

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:10%
say there are five
main initiatory

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:10%
levels-- student, apprentice,
initiate, adept, master.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Most people, the vast
majority of people,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
never pass the student stage.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It requires super perseverance,
application, and initiative.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, especially
in this modern world,

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
people simply do not
the time and tenacity

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill these
basic requirements.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they brush up
against the outer shell

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical groups, the
exoteric layer, and then leave.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They learn only the
principles, the parables,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and the external

Their platform is not

so they go out into the
world for a few hundred

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
or a few thousand more years,
stabilize and fortify, and then

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
return for more serious
study and application

for wisdom and growth.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
