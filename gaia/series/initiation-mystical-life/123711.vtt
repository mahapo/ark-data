00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.838 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:10%
>>I propose to you that
witnessing is really

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:10%
what spiritual development
is all about-- crafting

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
our skill as
witnesses, as pilgrims

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:10%
through this great mystery.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It is an art, and it can be
done with elegance and skill,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and one might even
say it ought to be.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The art of witnessing
develops much like any other--

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:90%
with practice and determination.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
When we have the
basics down, we can

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
begin to get creative,
to improvise,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to move into new,
uncharted territories.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It is always most
advisable to continue

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:90%
refining our poetic impulse.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.266 align:middle line:84%
The poet sees the depth
in all things you see.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
For me, there has always
been a happy overlap

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
between the poet, the
philosopher, and the mystic.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher poet,
like words [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
on nature, who has a taste
for the romantic in their pen,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
but first and
foremost, we really

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
must acknowledge and
honor the poet philosopher

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, because the
artistic spiritual attitude

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
connects us to the light
of the soul figuratively

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
and literally.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It is about a state
of being, rather than

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the mere acquisition
of knowledge.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
You see, the poet can
sense beauty everywhere.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
This is important, because
beauty is a marker for truth.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Beauty is a marker for truth.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher applies
that truth to life.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:84%
They weave it into the
wisdom of living and growth

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
and expression.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
The mystic walks
it at every step.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
They test it out, share it,
exchange it, develop it.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly
a kind of attitude

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that helps to augment
our spiritual growth.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Very often in life, we become
accustomed to regarding events

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
as somewhat haphazard.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Good things happen.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Bad things happen, cool
things, bizarre things.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
From a mystical
perspective, these

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
are illusions that derive
from a false polarization.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Polarization is the breaking
of one thing into two

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and the separation
of the two halves.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
They are cast out far from
each other to distant reaches,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they seem opposed,
but this is not true.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So within this
polarized world, we

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
are impelled to learn about
wholeness to get to truth.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what brings you
unitive thinking and mends what

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:90%
was once one.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
The nature of goodness is
really about wholeness.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
The nature of badness is
really about fragmentation.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
When we come across a
dysfunction, a challenge,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
a piece of brokenness, we learn
to think laterally about it,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:84%
not just to label it
as disadvantageous or

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:90%
inconvenient.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Within the disharmony,
that is a hidden wisdom.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Lateral thinking is different
to our usual methods of step

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:90%
by step logic.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We take a different
approach, a different route,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:90%
more creative, more intuitive.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
By altering our
line of engagement

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
with a challenge in
life, we see more.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Like Sherlock Holmes
arriving on the scene

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.572 align:middle line:84%
of some unfathomable
mystery, the regular police

00:03:30.572 --> 00:03:32.655 align:middle line:84%
have been there and think
they've seen everything,

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing else to do.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:10%
But their observations
have been very linear

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:10%
and commonplace and obvious,
so only obvious things

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:10%
can be perceived.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Knowing this, Holmes takes
a very different approach.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
He models the scene
in his imagination.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
He examines what
others do not examine.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He looks into realms that no one
else does, and I mean no one.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the same
in spiritual development.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Very often, we are quite
alone in our investigations,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
the initiatory test.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Can we energize ourselves
and craft our discernment

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently to find
the truth alone?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
To the ordinary onlooker, a
scene looks a certain way.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:90%
This is a chair.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a table.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a bowl of fruit.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
To the spiritual student,
this is not the case.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
We understand that the room is
a construct of the imagination.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The chair, the table,
the bowl of fruit

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
are simply energy fizzing in
and out of the quantum vacuum.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
There is no chair,
no table, no bowl.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They are mental ideas.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Neither is the coconut brown or
the banana yellow or the plum

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:90%
purple.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
There is no brown,
yellow, or purple.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:90%
They are descriptors.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They have no
actuality in reality.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The physical world is a phantom,
a holographic representation

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
of something else.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can be
taken at face value.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can be taken as it is.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
At its very core,
the essence of life

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is mysterious,
mysterious by design.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:90%
The mystery is the teacher.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
The mind can be
programmed by ourselves

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to encounter the world more
accurately, more openly,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
to cease pretending
everything is still and static

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and to admit that it is
actually in constant flux.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything is changing
moment by moment.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
To dedicate oneself to
spiritual attainment

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
is to edge away from what we
call village life, to slowly

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
but surely let go of the
comfortable certainties

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and well-worn habits that
previously brought consolation

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
to our minds and hearts.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The more serious we become about
encountering and expressing

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:84%
truth, the more we
must learn to let

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:90%
go of our image of ourselves.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
The heavy narrative
that accompanies our

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:90%
personally has to be loosened.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what is meant by
crossing the threshold.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
This is what is really
occurring when we choose

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%
spiritual transformation.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
There is an air of
self-possession to the human

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
who is refining themselves.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
They are not blown about in the
wind quite like everyone else.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:90%
They choose their responses.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They are not all
triggered unconsciously.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
They control their
perceptions and are

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
able to reach deeper
and further than normal.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They decide how quickly to walk,
when to smile, when to work,

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
when to sleep, when
to play, when to be

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:90%
filled to the brim with joy.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual attitude enables
a more profound and spontaneous

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:90%
encounter with the world.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of a sleeping child
and the late blooming autumn

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
flower can be seen
like never before.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Transformation of self
is the ultimate act

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of devotional practice.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
To become something else
day by day, week by week,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
year by year, this is the
only measure of attainment--

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to change, to change so
people who have not seen you

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
for a few years might
even explain that they

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
don't know what it is, but
somehow you're different

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:90%
now, somehow.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Not the person
they used to know.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.016 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a beautiful thing.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:84%
How bloody awful it would be
to remain the same, to be just

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:90%
as we were in high school.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
When we heal ourselves,
it changes us.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We become different,
and this, ironically,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
is why some people choose
not to heal themselves

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
of their primary wounds.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
They prefer to stick
with what they know.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
When we strengthen
ourselves, it changes us.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Strength brings adaptation,
momentum, transmutation.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
There arises a resounding
purpose and vigor

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
in one's thoughts, words, deeds.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Meaning and connectedness
increasingly

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
begin to present
themselves in life.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Things that were
separate become unified.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
What was weak and
confusing becomes

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:90%
solid and comprehensible.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
There is more
significance in how

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:84%
we do things, in the method
of growth and attainment.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
Not just information,
put in technique, skill,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and physical action.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
With time, this brings a
definite grace and propriety

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:90%
to one's conduct.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Our physical aspect changes.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:84%
A new kind of deportment
can be detected.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.937 align:middle line:84%
We could still laugh and joke
and be silly and playful.

00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Heaven knows this
is an important part

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.465 align:middle line:90%
of the human way and my life.

00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
If we can't do these
things frequently,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it wrong.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Laughter and play are just
as important to adults

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:90%
as they were to children.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
In truly embracing the
inevitable transformations that

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
arise from spiritual
growth, we find

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to be on a very
old and very distinguished

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:90%
kind of pilgrimage.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It is a voyage that
takes us through

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:84%
both inner and outer landscapes,
familiar and foreign,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
pleasing and wrenching,
clear and mysterious.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We develop an instinct for
where to go and what to witness.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We feel what is true
and what isn't true.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:90%
We take part in life.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We affirm it and
articulate it further.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
We begin to depart the
ordinary train tracks of things

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and routines and instead,
begin a relationship

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:90%
with a much larger universe.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We cease to merely attend
life as a passive onlooker,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and find ourselves with
a wonderful opportunity

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to participate, to be involved
in the actual unfolding

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Our will and mind become a
living component of reality.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Heart connects us to
that primal pulse.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
From the very origin
itself, this is a movement

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
from the incidental world
into the providential world,

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:84%
a place where reality is both
received and transmitted.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Once we have felt
spirit in our bones,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:84%
once we have tasted its truths
and revelations concerning both

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and the
universe, it is no longer

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
possible to content ourselves
with the trivialities of life.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Tricks that used to work,
diversionary tactics

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
of sedation and destruction,
become pale and empty.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:84%
The old objects
stop enthralling us,

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:90%
the 10,000 things of Taoism.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
The things of the world
don't do it for us anymore.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual development
teaches us most emphatically

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that the real substance of
life is not in its objects,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but in witnessing and
understanding its methods.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Only soul can lead to such
a fantastic exploration.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it is of
the most importance

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that we learn to bring its
essence into our daily life.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:90%
We sense it.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It is in our dreams.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It is where we truly are.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching,
and have a beautiful day.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:90%
