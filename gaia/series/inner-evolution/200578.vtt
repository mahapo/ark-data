>> Consciousness can manifest
any disease and even death.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Is there a science behind
the process of manifestation?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce
Lipton, for this series

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:10%
on "Inner Evolution."

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:84%
The revelation of
the DNA double helix

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic code in
1953 led to the belief

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that the character of
our health is primarily

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:90%
encoded in our genome.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:84%
This misperception leads
people with chronic diseases

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to believe that they are
victims of their heredity.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Up to 90% of all disease is
now attributed to stress, not

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctional genes.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
This session will
describe the role

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of emotions and symptoms
as feedback information,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
the role of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
axis, the HPA axis,
in undermining health,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and the power of the
placebo and nocebo effects

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
in shaping health and happiness.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin to understand how
thought shapes the character

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
of our machine-like body.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
In previous episodes, I've used
the model of a simple machine

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:10%
to help us understand
how biology works.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:10%
There are four components
of that machine.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:10%
There is the mechanism, which
represents the gears that

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:10%
carry out the function.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:10%
The proteins in the
body are the equivalent

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:10%
of that mechanism because the
proteins create the functions.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:10%
In addition, there is a
force that drives the gears,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:10%
and we now find out
that the force that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:10%
drives the gears is when
environmental signals combined

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:10%
with proteins, this engages
the proteins to create

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:10%
their function.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:10%
The third element is the switch.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:10%
This is a very important
element because it's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:10%
the switch that controls
the action of the machine.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
In a living organism, the
switch is the equivalent

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.309 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:10%
And in our study of
cells, we found out

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:10%
the cell membrane,
the skin of the cell,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:10%
represents the cell's brain
and nervous system and that,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:10%
through connecting environmental
signals to the proteins

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:10%
in the cell, the
membrane is controlling

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:10%
the function of what we
experience in cell biology.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:10%
The last part and not
the least is actually

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:10%
the gauges, the feedback.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well,
the gauges give us

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.872 align:middle line:10%
information on how the
machine is operating.

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
To give you a simple
understanding,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
consider the gauges on
the dashboard of your car

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and the significance
of these gauges.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the gauges,
you get an understanding

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of how the vehicle
is performing.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
These gauges tell us
about the operation

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:90%
of the machine, the vehicle.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the body, as
we talked about,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent of
a vehicle as well.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have gauges,
but our gauges

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
are much more easy
to understand.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Our gauges are actually a
sensation, feelings, emotions.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:84%
These are the gauges
that inform us

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:90%
about how our body is operating.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The gauges actually represent
functions of the human body

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
when we understand them.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
a pressure gauge,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and the pressure gauge
is really reflecting

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of pressure
that we have in our body.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So stress is a
representation of pressure.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The more stress,
the more pressure

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:90%
you're putting on the system.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
The second gauge actually
is the temperature gauge.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, temperature
in the human body

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
is connected to anger, because
as you start to get angry,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
your body temperature
starts to build up.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And we get angrier and angrier.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you overheat the system,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
just as the same
thing would happen

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
if you're driving your car
and watching the temperature

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
gauge go into the red.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The last gauge is
the battery gauge.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
In our connection
with the human body,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the battery gauge relates to our
relationship to love and fear.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Love is empowering our energy,
like empowering the battery.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, fear
disempowers our energy.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:90%
We lose our energy.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And so love and fear
actually represent

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
whether we're
charging our biology

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:90%
or actually using up our energy.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:90%
So the question is this.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do the
gauges represent?

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Again, emotions and symptoms.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Anger is an emotion.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're driving your car and
you see the temperature gauge

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
go up into the red,
you would obviously

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
say, well, I better pull over
and let this thing cool down

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:90%
so I don't overheat the engine.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
When we get angry, if we had
a gauge, what we would also

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
notice is that we
are also building up

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:90%
a lot of heat in the system.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, the same
thing applies to us.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:84%
If we start to build
up too much anger,

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the most important safety
measure at this point

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
would be to stop and cool
off, because if we really

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
push that anger, we'll
overheat the system

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and cause damage to
our physical body.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So anger is one
of those emotions,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and we should recognize
it as not just some side

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
effect of our biology,
but as feedback

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
on the operation of how
we are using our biology.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
applies to pressure.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:90%
How much stress are we under?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If you start to see the
pressure gauge go up too high,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:90%
it could blow a gasket.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what, if you start
to get under too much stress,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
your biological vehicle
could also blow a gasket.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So these are not just side
effects of being in a body.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.332 align:middle line:84%
These are actually the
body talking back to you,

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and we should pay
as much attention

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to the emotions in our
body as we actually do

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
to the gauges on our dashboard.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Symptoms are the
equivalent of gauges,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and there are some very
fundamental symptoms,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
such as fever, a
swelling that occurs

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
if you've damaged some
part of your body,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
or pain, the information
coming from the body

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to tell you about
the performance

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of your biological vehicle.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
unfortunate situation

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
because when we start to
feel a lot of discomfort,

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
medical doctors actually like to
alleviate our pain by giving us

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
medications and drugs
to remove the experience

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of these negative symptoms,
these negative feelings

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
you know what, that

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is throwing a monkey wrench
into a fine-tuned machine.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.390 align:middle line:84%
When you take a drug and
cover up the symptoms,

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
it would be the same
as taking masking tape

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and covering up the
gauges on your dashboard.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to pay
attention to the gauges,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.773 align:middle line:90%
but there's a problem with that.

00:06:52.773 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the gauges
were informing you

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:84%
about the vehicle's operation,
and if you cover up the gauges,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
you don't understand
what's going on.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:90%
You ignore what's going on.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you can
actually cause greater damage

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
to biology.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
These symptoms, such
as fever, are actually

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the result of a million
years of evolution,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and the significance is this--

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:90%
a fever is not to punish you.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
A fever is the
body's recognition

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that you have an infection
and that this infection is

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
temperature sensitive.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And why it's important to
raise your body temperature

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is that it will kill
these infective organisms.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
If you have a fever, one of
the most important things to do

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually wrap
yourself up in a blanket

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and help the body
increase the temperature

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
because that is what the
mechanism was all about.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
That mechanism was to
kill the infective agent.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere up to about
105 degree temperature,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
that's in the normal range.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
If you go above
105, then you might

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
need some kind of intervention
to help you with the problem.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
But up to 105, support the body.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Allow the fever to occur.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It will immediately at that
point stop the infection.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you interfere
with that fever,

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
you will prolong the infection.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Another symptom that we
interfere with is swelling.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't look pretty,
you don't like the looks of it,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
so we put ice on
swelling, and that

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:90%
will bring the swelling down.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I say, was the
swelling a problem?

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, swelling was a result of
a million years of evolution.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:90%
What does swelling represent?

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It represents the fact that
the biology is actually

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
increasing the fluid
in the tissue where

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:90%
the damage occurred.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
When you've broken cells,
you caused tissue damage

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and trauma, and the fluid that's
pumped in that causes swelling

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is actually used to wash
out the damaged material.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And so swelling is actually an
effort to help heal the body.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if you start
to put ice on a swelling,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you're interfering with
the body's mechanism

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:90%
of self-healing.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a
symptom that is actually

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:90%
expressing a healing response.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And lastly, pain--
when we hurt ourselves

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:10%
and then we have trouble
walking, let's say,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:10%
there's a tendency
to take a pain

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:10%
reliever so I don't have to feel
the side effects of the pain.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the pain wasn't
there to punish you.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
The pain was there as
important information in regard

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:90%
to how you operate your body.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Basically it says not to
use that part of the body

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
at this time, like a gauge on
the dashboard that this part is

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
now under repair,
and by continuing

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to use this part because
you've covered up the pain,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
you're actually,
again, interfering

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:90%
with the healing of the body.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So in understanding the nature
of emotions and symptoms,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:84%
recognize they are your
body's cells talking

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to you, the operator
of the vehicle,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
to give you information
on the performance

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and what is necessary to
maintain health in the system.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, in addition to
symptoms and emotion,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
the body can break down
and start to manifest

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:90%
what we refer to as a disease.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what
can cause a disease?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
As we described
earlier, life represents

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
proteins plus signals, which
cause the proteins to engage

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:90%
in a behavior.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But if the behavior is
not operating correctly,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
we refer to this as a
problem and refer to it

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
as a dis-ease, that something
is wrong with the system.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Either the signal or the protein
is the cause of the problem.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, either of those
sources can create a disease.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So I say, OK, can the
protein be defective?

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course a protein
could be defective,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
especially if the genetics
programming that protein

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
are not creating a
functional protein.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
If there's an alteration
in the blueprint, the DNA,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
it will cause a
defect in the protein,

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, that
protein won't operate

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
according to normal function.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And that dysfunction
of the protein

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%
actually can lead to a disease.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to understand this.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
How much of disease
is actually connected

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to defects in our
proteins or defects

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
in our genetics that are
producing that protein?

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is simply this--

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:84%
between birth defects and
random mutations, less than 10%

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
of disease is actually connected
to a defect in the protein

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms in our body.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And actually, many people
believe less than 1% of disease

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:90%
is due to defective proteins.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
let's say proteins are

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.160 align:middle line:90%
responsible for 10% of disease.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we're left with, what is
responsible for the remaining

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
90% of disease?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only one
thing left in the equation,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and that is the signal.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, how can
a signal create a disease?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, if you
alter or distort

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the signal between the nervous
system and the target cells

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and proteins in
those cells, then

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to interfere with
the behavior of that cell.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, what
can alter a signal?

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, number one, trauma.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
If I, let's say, fall
down and wrench my back,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:90%
what will that do?

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would cause
an interference

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
on the information traveling
from my nervous system

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to my body.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
That interference
will alter the signal,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and so trauma can be
a cause of a disease.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
In addition to trauma,
toxins in the system

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:84%
can interfere with
the signaling process

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and cause the disease
because toxins in the system

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
can distort the signal
between the source

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
in the nervous system
and the target cells

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
where that signal
is destined to go.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
However, the biggest single
issue in causing a disease

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:90%
is not trauma or toxins.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It is thought.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And thought, what
does that mean?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if I
misinterpret the environment

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and send an inappropriate
signal to my body to adjust it

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:90%
to my misinterpretation?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, now the body
will be out of harmony

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
with the environment.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
That is the primary cause of a
disease where our consciousness

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is misinterpreting environmental
signals and, as a result,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:90%
engaging inappropriate behavior.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:10%
So I look at these three
sources of disease--

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:10%
trauma, toxin, and thought.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:10%
And guess what they represent?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, trauma represents
a physical stress,

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:10%
toxin represents
a chemical stress,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and thought is an emotional
stress when it's incorrect.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden I start to
recognize the important part,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that it is these stresses that
are responsible for the health

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
issues that we
face in this world.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the American
Psychological Association

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
has recognized that up to
90% of all doctor visits

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:90%
are for stress-related ailments.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are two
kinds of stress

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:90%
that we have to consider here.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
One type of stress
is called eustress.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The other type of stress
is called distress.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, eustress is good stress.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:90%
You go, stress that's good?

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:90%
What could that be?

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is this--

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:10%
if you're exercising,
playing a sport,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:10%
you're pushing on the
system to perform,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:10%
and this effort actually
causes a stress on the system,

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:10%
because as you are pushing on
the system and playing a sport

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:10%
or exercising, you're
actually causing the system

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:10%
to build up its strength.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And so this kind of stress
enhances the health of the body

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and the strength of the system.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So eustress-- sports, hiking,
swimming, whatever it may be--

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:90%
is a good stress.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.630 align:middle line:90%
The problems come from distress.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And distress, what
does it represent?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it represents
any interference

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that gets in the way of
pursuing your destination,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
pursuing your
wishes and desires.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Anything that interferes with
that destination or that desire

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
can be cataloged
as being a stress.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
distress turns out

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to be the problem in the system.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
nature of this,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
let's look at cells in
a tissue culture dish.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I put cells in a culture dish.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I split the experiments
into two sets of dishes,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and one set of dishes
I put nutrients

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in front of the cells, and
the second set of dishes

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I put toxins in
front of the cells.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Then I put the culture
dishes back in the incubator

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and come back a
little bit later,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:90%
and the question is this--

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
where are the cells
going to be in each dish?

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.607 align:middle line:84%
When we put positive
signals such as nutrients

00:15:56.607 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
in front of the cells,
the cells will always

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
move toward the
positive signals.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, when we
put negative substances

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
such as toxins in
the dish, the cells

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
will always move away
from those signals.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Cells will move toward
growth, and they will always

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
move away from stress signals
that interfere with growth.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is also a
very important insight

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:90%
for this reason.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Cells cannot be in growth moving
toward positive signals and be

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in protection moving away from
negative signals at the same

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Growth means you
have to be open.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, growth means you
move toward a signal,

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
but you're open to
take the signal in.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
To incorporate it, assimilate
it, the cell has to be open.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, if there's a
threat in the environment,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:90%
the cells don't stay open.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
The cells close themselves
down in a form of protection.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Simple conclusion is this--

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
cells cannot be in growth and
in protection at the same time.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
They can be an either
one, but not both.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:84%
And this applies
to our human body

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
as a collective nature of 50
trillion cells, the same thing.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:84%
We cannot be in growth
and enhance our vitality

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and in protection at
the very same time.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
So growth and protection are
mutually exclusive behaviors

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:90%
in a cell.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
Well, in our human
body, I can tell you

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the significance of getting
in a protection response

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and how caustic it
is to our vitality

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
by understanding
the nature of what

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:84%
is called the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
axis, abbreviated
as the HPA axis.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:10%
Significance is this--
when you perceive stress

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:10%
in the environment,
it is the hypothalamus

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:10%
that is interpreting that
signal as being stressful.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So the hypothalamus
has to inform

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the 50 trillion
cells of the body

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that a threat exists
in their world.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So what does the hypothalamus
do it sends a signal

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to the pituitary gland.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
If you remember in high school,
it was called the master gland

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because the secretions
of the pituitary gland

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
control the fate of the body's
50 trillion cell community.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a state of stress,
the pituitary gland,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
upon receiving that signal
from the hypothalamus,

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
will itself send signals,
not to the whole body,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
but actually primarily
to the adrenal glands.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's important
about the stress response?

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the adrenal
gland is fight or flight.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a stress response,
what parts of your body

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
do you think you're
going to primarily use

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
to be in fight or flight?

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is simple.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:10%
You're going to be using
your arms and legs.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:10%
And why is this relevant?

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I'm being chased
by the proverbial tiger,

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
escape that tiger,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use my
arms and legs to escape.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Where does energy come from?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:90%
It's carried in the blood.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:10%
The relevance is this--
if I'm in fight or flight,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:10%
I want all the energy
available my body

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:10%
to go to my arms and legs
so I can escape the threat.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, where's the
blood in the body anyway?

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly,
in a state of growth,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
the blood is primarily
in the viscera.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, why
should the blood be here?

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
the organs of maintaining

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
the health of the body
and repairing the body

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
is occurring through
visceral organs.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a normal state of growth,
the blood in the viscera

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
is supporting our vitality.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
However, as I said, when we're
trying to escape the tiger,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
we don't want the
blood in the viscera.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
We want all the blood with
all the energy I can muster up

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:90%
to go into my arms and legs.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And here's how it works.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
When the adrenal glands
release stress hormones

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
in the body, what
they actually cause

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is the blood vessels in
the gut, the viscera,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:90%
to constrict and close down.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:90%
And why would it do this?

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, if I squeeze
the blood vessels in the gut,

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
it forces the blood
to the arms and legs.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you've
ever been under stress,

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
you may have even felt the
closing of the blood vessels

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
because it feels
like a fluttering,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:90%
like butterflies in the stomach.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You can feel,
actually, the squeezing

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
shut of the blood vessels,
which then forces the blood

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
to the arms and legs so
butterflies in the stomach

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is the first symptom of a
stress response in an effort

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to redirect the
flow of the blood.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, closing down the
blood flow to the viscera

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
would actually cause a
debilitation of the body.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
to go back and say,

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.095 align:middle line:84%
when was this fight or flight
mechanism actually created?

00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And I say, a million years ago.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So I say, so significance?

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you ran and
escaped the tiger,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:90%
guess what, no more threat.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
the protection response

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
will end after a
very brief period

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and return the blood
flow back to maintain

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
the health of the
body by returning

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:90%
the blood to the viscera again.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Today's world,
stresses are 24/7, 365.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
If you are chronically
eliminating the blood

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
flow from the gut, that
means you are continuously

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
undermining the
health of a body.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:10%
And there's another
negative aspect

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:10%
to stress that's equally
important, and that is this--

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:10%
recognize that the
immune system, which

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:10%
is the system that
protects you from threats

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:10%
on the inside of the body,
uses a tremendous amount

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:10%
of bodily energy.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
To understand that,
just remember a time

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.507 align:middle line:84%
when you were sick that
how little energy you had.

00:21:40.507 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:10%
You probably didn't
have enough energy

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:10%
to even get out
of bed sometimes,

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:10%
and that's because
the immune system

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:10%
uses extensive
quantities of energy

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:10%
to operate its functions.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So, guess what?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:90%
You're being chased by a tiger.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
You have a bacterial infection.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
How much of the
energy should I use

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to provide for the immune
system to fight the bacteria,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and how much of the energy,
or the blood in this case,

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
should I send to
the arms and legs

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:90%
to run away from the tiger?

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Who cares about a
bacterial infection

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:90%
if you can't escape the tiger?

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
If the tiger catches you,
the bacterial infection

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is actually the tiger's
problem at this point.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:90%
So the significance is this--

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
in a state of stress,
the stress hormones

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
released by the
adrenal gland inhibit

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
the function of
the immune system

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to conserve energy to deal with
the external threat, the stress

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.887 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive.

00:22:36.887 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
start to recognize, well,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
what's the
consequence of stress?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
two primary things.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
One, it shuts down the
maintenance of the body.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And two, it shuts down
the immune system.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:90%
We are now open to disease.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The immune system is
inhibited, and all of a sudden

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:90%
we start to manifest illness.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting
point-- a lot of people

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
believe that illness is the
result of catching something.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I caught a bug, so to speak.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I go, here's an important fact--

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
almost every human
is already infected

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
with most of the pathogens
that affect human biology.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And you go, well,
if I'm infected,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
how come I'm having a healthy
day today if I'm so infected?

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, it's
interesting because medicine

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
calls these inherent infections
opportunistic organisms.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
In a normal individual
who is not under stress,

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the immune system will
repress the growth

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of these opportunistic
organisms.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But the moment
you're under stress

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and you inhibit the
immune system, that's

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
when these organisms take
the opportunity to start

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to replicate very quickly,
and all of a sudden you

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
start to come down with illness.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
This is especially
prevalent in schools,

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
for example, when
students are facing exams.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The stress of the
exam interferes

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
with the immune system and
offers opportunistic organisms

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
take over the system.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.515 align:middle line:84%
As mentioned, up
there 90% of disease

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:90%
is actually due to stress.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting
because the fear

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:84%
that induces that stress doesn't
just affect the individuals.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
entire population.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
the late 1920s when

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
the US was experiencing what
was called the Great Depression.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
There was illness all over
the land at that time.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:90%
In fact, even the land got ill.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:10%
The former breadbasket
of the United States,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:10%
the Midwest, all of a sudden
turned into the Dust Bowl.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole country
was in fear at that time.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And relevance is that,
how did we get out of it?

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Franklin D. Roosevelt, when
he was elected in 1933,

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
declared in his
inauguration speech--

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.203 align:middle line:90%
Let me assert my--

00:24:55.203 --> 00:25:01.364 align:middle line:84%
Quote-- "the only thing we
have to fear is fear itself."

00:25:01.364 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:90%
--fear itself.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Because Roosevelt
understood it was the fear

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that was the primary
cause of the stress

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that the nation
was experiencing.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
In consequence of
that, Roosevelt

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
started to read the Sunday
comics to the citizens

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
What-- to alleviate the fear
and bring some happiness and joy

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:90%
into the population.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what terminated
the Great Depression.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So now we have an understanding
how consciousness controls

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
the body's growth
and fear responses,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts, the
basis of the placebo effect,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and gauge growth and
healing responses.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The mechanism's
profoundly simple.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:84%
As we described earlier,
the function of the mind

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is to create coherence between
your beliefs and your reality.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
If you have a positive
belief about a drug

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to heal
you and you take the drug

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and you get healed
and later find out

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:90%
it was just a sugar pill--

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the placebo effect--
what healed you?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It was the belief that the
drug was going to heal you.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It was belief that healed you.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, if you
have a negative effect,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
a negative expectation,
such as a prognosis that

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:84%
says you're going to be very
ill or you're going to die,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
the belief in that
negative aspect

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
will actually be
used by the mind

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to create a reality that
matches that negative aspect.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
This is called
the nocebo effect.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically your thoughts
can enhance your health

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
or actually cause any illness
based on your belief issue.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, when genetic
defects alter protein structure

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and function and create illness,
we are victims of our heredity.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:90%
That's true in this case.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:10%
In contrast, though, nine out
of 10 cases of chronic illness

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:10%
are not under the
control of genes.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:10%
They are due to the consequences
of physical trauma, toxins,

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:10%
and adverse consciousness.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
In this case,
knowledge is power,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
which can be harnessed
to control health.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
In our next session,
we will focus

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
on the microbiome, your
personalized community

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of friendly bacteria
and yeast that

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
are actually an essential and
vital part of human biology.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce
Lipton, for this series

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:10%
on "Inner Evolution"
through biological change.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Join me for the
next episode where

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
two new insights

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:90%
to enhance our immune system.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:90%
