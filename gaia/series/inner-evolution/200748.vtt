00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know that within
our bodies we have a fountain

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.410 align:middle line:90%
of youth?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The mechanics of
telomere growth offers

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:84%
us insight on how we can
create a long-lived biology.

I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on Inner Evolution.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
In our last session,
we described

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
how the microbiome and tonsils
impact the effectiveness

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:84%
of the immune system to enhance
our vitality and our quality

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:84%
This session's
presentation focuses

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
on the role of telomeres,
the body's equivalent

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Fountain of Youth.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We are all mortal
organisms, which

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:90%
means we will inevitably die.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
When our time comes,
does it really

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
mean death is an ending
to our existence?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
An assessment of our cell
membrane's population

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of protein receptors
suggests that a part of us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
survives after
death, an energy that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
implies the existence
of a spiritual realm.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Animals and plants have a
generally defined lifespan

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
between the time they're
born and the time they die.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
When the science of
genetics was developed,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
geneticists were looking

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
for were to identify
the genes that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.365 align:middle line:90%
presumably control our aging.

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But is aging a
genetic character?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:10%
In the early 1970s, Russian
theorist Alexei Olovnikov first

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:10%
recognized that the
ends of a chromosome

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:10%
could not be replicated when
the cell divided, a finding that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:10%
revealed a segment
of the terminal DNA

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:10%
sequences in a
chromosome are lost

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:10%
every time a cell replicates.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:10%
When the loss of the DNA strand
reaches a critical level,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:10%
the cell can no longer
replicate, and then it dies.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Further research
reveals that there

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
are extensions of non-coding
DNA at the terminal

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:90%
ends of the chromosome.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
These extensions are
called telomeres,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and they have two
fundamental functions.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
One, they prevent the DNA
double helix from unwinding,

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
an action that will cause it
to be degraded by enzymes.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And two, the telomeres
allow the DNA

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
to be copied without
losing genetic information.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
The DNA copying enzyme
DNA polymerase is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
what duplicates DNA molecules.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:10%
However, physical
limitations prevent it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:10%
from reading and
copying a short stretch

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:10%
of the DNA at the terminal
end of the DNA strand.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
The reason for shortening of
the telomeres is very simple.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a DNA molecule
as a railroad track,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and that the enzyme that
copies DNA, the DNA polymerase,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is an engine moving
down the track.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
As the DNA polymerase
moves down the track,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
it leaves behind in its
trail a duplicate copy

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA on which
the engine was riding.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:84%
However, the enzyme cannot copy
the DNA piece on which it is

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:90%
sitting.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So when the DNA has been copied,
the polymerase moves down

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the track and copies
everything, but at the very end

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
of the strand, the engine of the
polymerase is sitting on that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.835 align:middle line:90%
track and cannot copy it.

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The significance is
profound, because it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:84%
means that every time
you copy the DNA,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
it gets a little shorter
than the original version.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So every replication of
DNA reduces the length

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%
of that DNA molecule.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what leads to
aging, depression, and disease.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So nature facilitates
us, then, the ability

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
to extend the replication
time by adding a piece of DNA

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the DNA strand
that doesn't code for anything.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
It's just an extra piece
of DNA track, so to speak.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
DNA is a double helix, and it is
very stable as a double helix.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But if the DNA starts
to unfold, and the helix

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
starts to separate, then
the free ends of the DNA

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
are now opened to
digestion by enzymes.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So if a DNA unfolds,
enzymes will actually

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
destroy the DNA molecule.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
that the telomeres,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
the little extensions
at the end of the DNA,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
act as a mechanism to prevent
the unwinding of the DNA.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
To give you an analogy, when
you have a pair of shoelaces,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
you also note at the
end of the shoelaces

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
a little plastic
capsule at the very end.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.695 align:middle line:84%
It actually has a
name called an aglet.

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:10%
An aglet holds the
strands together

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:10%
to prevent them from unwinding,
because if you lose that aglet,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:10%
what happens?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The shoelace starts to unwind,
and you get a big bushy end

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:90%
to that shoelace.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult now
to push that shoelace

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
through the eyelet in the shoe,
because it's all flared out.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it actually decreases
the function of that shoelace.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, simply, the
thing occurs in DNA.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
If the DNA helix
unfolds, then the DNA

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to be broken
down by enzymes.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But the telomeres act as
the equivalent of an aglet.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
They hold the strands
of the DNA together

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to prevent its unwinding
and subsequent degradation.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's one primary
function of the telomere.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But the primary
function of the telomere

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
turns out that it makes an
extension of the DNA that

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
allows the DNA to be shortened
every time the DNA is copied

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
without affecting
the gene programs.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So this allows so many divisions
before we run out of telomeres.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, it was believed that
the lifespan of an organism

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is based on how many times
a cell can divide before it

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
loses those telomere
extensions and then cuts

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA program.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Leonard Hayflick, a
scientist back in the 1960s,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
did a calculation based on how
long the telomere extension was

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and how many times
it could divide

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
before the telomere was gone.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:10%
He comes up with a
number that a cell

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:10%
can divide about 60 times
before it loses its telomere.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, when he put
that information

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
into our biology, how many
years does that account for?

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hayflick's
number comes down

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to a human can live to
approximately 90 years

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
before the telomeres
are lost and then

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
subsequent
replications of the DNA

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
interfere with
the gene programs.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It turns out we
live about 90 years,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's apparently how
long the telomeres exist

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:90%
before being cut off.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that sort of said our
lifespan as a human is limited.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1984, research scientist
Elizabeth Blackburn

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
discovered an
enzyme, telomerase,

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that can extend the
length of telomeres, which

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
when translated
means the potential

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to extend the human lifespan.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
However, this enzyme
can be activated

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
or inhibited based on what
we're experiencing in our life.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:10%
So for example, things that
will inhibit the enzyme

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:10%
and prevent us from
extending our lifespan

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:10%
include things such as bad
nutrition, childhood abuse,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:10%
domestic violence,
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:10%
no self-love or loss of
love, no purpose in life.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
characteristics

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
really takes away the
character and quality

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of our life, which in a
sense, if you think about it,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
means well, I'm not happy
with my life the way it is,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
so ending sooner is
not a big problem.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast,
there are activities

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
that enhance telomerase
activity and can extend

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:90%
our lifespan and our health.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And these activities
include number one

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
providing good nutrition,
especially omega-3.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Exercise, happiness, and
gratitude, as well as

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
a positive outlook,
self-love, and love.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:10%
And having a purpose
in life, meaning you

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:10%
have something you have to do.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important, because having

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
a life purpose is really a
conscious intention saying

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not finished.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
I have more to do.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And that feedback enhances
the telomerase activity

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to extend your life.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, health caregivers have
a longer life than other people

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that are not involved
in that activity.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand
this and start

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to live with love, and purpose,
and happiness, and gratitude,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to make your
life extended, because you're

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
going to activate
this telomerase,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
increase the telomeres,
and allow your stem

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
cells to replicate more
frequently and also, then,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in the process extend
your life and your health.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, in addition
to the telomerase,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
there was also another
insight into aging.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And this involved what is
called parabiosis experiments.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, parabiosis is when
you take two organisms

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and surgically put them
together so that the circulation

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
system of one is connected
to the circulation

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:90%
system of the other.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:10%
And they do a lot of experiments
with putting rats together,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:10%
or mice together,
and then trying

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:10%
to find out what is the
consequence of sharing

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:10%
a circulatory system?

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's what they found.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:10%
They found that when
you put a younger animal

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:10%
and parabiose it
with an older animal

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:10%
that the older
animals will actually

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:10%
start to express youthing.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
They slow down their aging
and they improve their health

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and vitality when their
circulation system carries

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
blood from a younger organism.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, now the
significance is this.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Is the mechanism that
influences youthing

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
present in the blood as
something that enhances youth,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
like present in the
young blood, or is it

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
something that compromises
youth by something

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that's released into the
blood of older individuals?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
been worked out yet,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
but the conclusion is very clear
that younger blood enhances

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:84%
the vitality of older
organisms, again suggesting

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that some component in
blood is very much involved

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
with the length of our lives.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
But the length of our lives
inevitably will come to an end,

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and we'll finally age,
and we'll finally die.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, is our existence

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
fully terminated with death?

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
In Newtonian terms,
the physical realm

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that we live with, well, that
dies, so the answer is yes,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
we're terminated.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But in the realm
of quantum physics,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
we're offered an
alternative possibility,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
for the realm of energy is
neither created nor destroyed.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Insight into our
potential spirituality

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is linked to a unique
biological identity.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.780 align:middle line:84%
No two people are
biologically the same.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is evidenced by the
simple fact that we cannot

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
exchange cells, tissues,
or organs with one another.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I put my cells
into your body,

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
your immune system
will distinguish

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:90%
that it's not your cells.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It distinguishes self
from foreign cells.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And why this is
really important,

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
it says that somewhere
on ourselves there's

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
an identity that an
immune system can

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
recognize and distinguish
self from not self.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, to try and
understand that,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take two
identical cell types.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's say two liver cells.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I want two cells
that are carrying out

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:90%
the exact same function.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
different between them.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
One of them is Bruce's cell, and
the other is Margaret's cell.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So now there are two identities.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Two liver cells, but each
has a unique identity.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
The question is
where in that cell

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
is the unique
identity to be found?

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, first of all, I know
the nuclei of the cells

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
In experiments that
I've even done,

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
you can remove the
nucleus of a cell

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and the cell can live for weeks
without the nucleus in it.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So in our little
model that I'm going

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to show you, let's ignore the
nucleus for the time being

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and just look at the cell.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the issue.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
When I remove the color
from the two cells

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
where they are exactly
the same, guess what?

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The only color that's
left in the image

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is on the surface of the
membrane covering each cell.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what is on
the surface of the membrane that

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:90%
gives us identity?

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, interesting
enough, science

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
has recognized there
are a series of what

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
we call protein receptors
that are distinguishing

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:90%
one person from another.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact,
science gives a name

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to these receptors
as self receptors.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's
relevant about that?

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Self receptors.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Well the term already
says, receivers of self.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.265 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about that is where

00:13:39.265 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:90%
are the receptors located?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
On the outer
surface of the cell.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, just for a theoretical
understanding, is simply this.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
If I take my cells and
remove my self receptors,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
then my cell has no
personal identity anymore.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Bruce is gone.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Self receptors are gone.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I could take a cell where
I remove my self receptors

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and implant it to
any one of you,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and you would never reject
it, because in this case,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
it would just be a liver
cell with no identity.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, in another theoretical
understanding, I do this.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I remove my self
receptors from my cell

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and I take the receptors of
self from Margaret's cells

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and transplant
them onto my cell.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:10%
So I have my cell with
Margaret's receptors on it.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
If I put that cell
back in my own body,

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I would reject my own cell.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
However, if I put that
cell into Margaret's body,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
she would accept it as self.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So the profound
insight is simply this.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Identity is related
to a set of antennas

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the cell.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when
medical doctors

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
want to transplant an organ
from one person to another,

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't want the
recipient's immune system

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to aggressively fight
the transplanted organ.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:90%
So what do they do?

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They look at the self
receptors on the donor organ.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They look at those
self receptors

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:90%
on the recipient's organs.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And what they try
and find is can they

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
get an overlap of
these self receptors?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like a giant
combination lock.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can overlap
some of the receptors

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
but never get a
complete identical set

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:90%
between two people.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So there is an
amount of overlap.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
The more overlap in
the self receptors,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
the less the recipient's
immune system

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
will aggressively attack
the transplanted organ.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's how come if
a heart is available,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:90%
who is it going to go to?

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
first they look

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
at all the potential recipients,
check their self receptors,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and then find anyone
in that group who

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
has a combination
of self receptors

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
that match the receptors
on the donating heart.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
really facilitates

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
the acceptance of a transplanted
organ into a recipient.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are self
receptors doing?

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the term receptor already
gives you an indication.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a receiver of information.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
to then understand

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
this possibility is that the
self receptors on your cell

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
are reading an energy
field outside of the cell

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:90%
that we would call self.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wow.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
A cell is like a television
set with an antenna on it,

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
actually a group of
antennas, self receptors.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's receiving a broadcast
from the environment.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
that cell is alive,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:90%
it will download this broadcast.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You're watching the TV, the TV
breaks, you say the TV is dead.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:90%
But the question is this.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Did the broadcast stop
because the TV died?

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is no.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And how would you know that?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, simply.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You get another TV, plug it
in, turn it on, and tune it

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to the station, and
the show is back online

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
but in a different
television set.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Now let's relate
this to a human.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagine Bruce here
is a TV set playing

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:84%
the Bruce show which
is a field coming

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:90%
into my personal antennas.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:10%
And if I die, is my
identity still there?

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's a field.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
Energy is neither
created nor destroyed.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I am part of a field.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:10%
And so even if my
physical body disappears,

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:10%
my identity is still
part of an energy

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:10%
field in the environment.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what would happen
if a future embryo shows up

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
with the exact same
set of receptors

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:90%
that I have on my cell now?

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd be back online
again but in a different body,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
a different TV.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Well does it make a difference
if it's a male or female TV?

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:90%
I go, no, that's the TV.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not the broadcast.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Does it make a difference if
it's black, white, red, brown,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:90%
yellow?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Nope, nope.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the TV.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:10%
That's not the broadcast.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden it
says, oh my goodness,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:10%
we have a perpetual
field that identifies us,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:10%
and that bodies come and go.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundation of what
we refer to as reincarnation.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't die, because
you're not even in here.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:90%
You are a broadcast field.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this changes, then,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:90%
who we really are.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:84%
We are not really the
physical entities.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That's just the mechanism
that translates our identity

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
so we can communicate
in this physical world.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:90%
So what is field?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, in quantum physics,
the term field simply

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
represents invisible
moving forces that

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:90%
influence the physical world.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact
same definition

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality, which
represents invisible moving

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
forces that influence
the physical realm.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, quantum
physics and spirituality

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
are both saying the same thing,
that we're not really in here,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:90%
that we are an energy field.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And that we are broadcast
through the environment.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is an interesting
piece of research

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
from Cleve Backster,
who worked for the CIA

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:90%
as a polygraph expert.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:84%
He took cells from
an individual,

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
put them in a Petri dish, and
moved that dish 100 miles away

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:90%
from that individual.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And he has an electrical
readout, the equivalent

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of a polygraph mechanism,
reading the electrical field

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:90%
generated by the cells.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So the individual is here.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Their cells are 100 miles away.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:84%
They have a split
screen television set.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
On one half of the screen is
an image of the individual.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
half of the screen

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is the readout of the electrical
activity from 100 miles away

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
from the cells of that donor.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the donor of the cells
has an emotional response,

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously, 100 miles
away, the donor cells

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to actually express
an enhanced electrical activity

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.475 align:middle line:84%
in response to the donor's
emotional response.

00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:10%
The significance is profound.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the donor has cells with
his own receptors built in,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:90%
his own self receptors.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:10%
And the cells that he
put in the culture dish

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
also have the same
self receptors.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:84%
While the individual
is here expressing

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
an emotional response, the
field, which is broadcast,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
is extending that response
to wherever anything

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
could read that response, such
as the cells in the Petri dish

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:90%
100 miles away.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
The important
understanding is this.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Our identity isn't just
locked into this body.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Our identity is in the field.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And wherever our
cells are, the cells

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
will respond to a
change in the field.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
A little interesting
sidelight that makes it really

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:90%
an important story is this.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Many mothers can recognize
when their child somewhere

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in the world is
having a problem.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
If they've been in an accident,
or they're hurt in some way,

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:84%
a mother, no matter where
she is in the world,

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
generally can experience
that something

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is wrong with her child.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
How can that happen?

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Well it turns out during
child development,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
during the time when there's
a placenta and the child's

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in the womb, stem
cells from the child

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
actually migrate in to
the maternal system.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But studies in Rome at the
Vatican, guess what they found?

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Many of the child's
stem cells end up

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:84%
in the nervous
system of the mother.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
So think about it this way.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The brain of the mother is like
a culture dish that contains

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.428 align:middle line:90%
stem cells from her own child.

00:21:46.428 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I say so what's
the significance?

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I say her child can be on
the other side of the world,

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
have an accident, and
she can experience it.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden says,
oh my goodness, a mother

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
is still connected
to her offspring

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
because she carries
the stem cells.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
She's the equivalent
of the culture dish.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's a wonderful
understanding

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
of A, the experiment and
a natural consequence

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
of women understanding
that their own children are

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in trouble some
place on the planet.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So when we put
all this together,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that our
identity is actually

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:90%
not built into the system.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a source
out in the field.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Where that source comes from?

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can't tell you.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But it may be related
to the movement

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and the planets,
because our identity is

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:90%
influenced by them as well.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Now you say, oh,
astrology, that's made up.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
That's phony.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Let me also give you a
very important insight

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that the movements of the
moon and the planets around us

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:90%
influence life on this planet.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So rather than saying astrology,
let's call it astro physiology.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
For a simple example, the moon
influences the menstrual cycle

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
They're on a 28-day cycle,
the same cycle as the moon.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:90%
What a coincidence.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not a coincidence.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The moon is influencing
the behavior of the woman.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Another influence
of the moon was

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
found in a study
on snails that live

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean, marine snails.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
When snails eat, their behavior
is that they move in a spiral.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
is profound,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because if a snail keeps
moving in a spiral,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:84%
it never crosses
over its own tracks.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It's always getting
fresh material

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:84%
as it's moving through
its environment.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, they did an experiment
where they had a track that

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
turned into a Y. And
what they would do

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is put a snail at the
beginning of the track,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and when it got down to
the branch, to the Y,

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
it turned out the snail
always went to the right.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was the
movement of the spiral.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The spiral was always
to go to the right,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:90%
so that's what they anticipated.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But it turned out that
during the experiments,

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:84%
there were times where the
snail would end up going 50-50.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
50% to the right,
and 50% to the left.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
what was this all about?

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they looked
at the date of the time

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:84%
they did these
experiments, they found

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that every time the
new moon was present,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:90%
the snails behavior went 50-50.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing they
thought of, well, the moon

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:90%
affects gravity.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was create
an artificial gravity

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:90%
underneath the snails.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the time of
the new moon, they

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:84%
rotated this artificial
gravity 180 degrees off

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:90%
from the normal orientation.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
When they created an artificial
gravity and moved it,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
then the snails then
continue to go to the right.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:90%
The point was very clear.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The behavior of
the snail is tied

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:90%
to the gravity of the planet.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But the gravity of
the planet is altered

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:90%
by the movement of the moon.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
The net result is this.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the moon's phase determined
the behavior of the snail.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
scientific understanding

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
of how an extraterrestrial
structure, such as the moon,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:90%
can alter life on this planet.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So now let's come to a
very simple understanding.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Our identities are
actually derived

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
from an energy field,
presumably connected

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, the moon,
and the planets.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:90%
And why is this relevant?

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us came
from the same source.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
You might say, yeah,
but in our world

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:90%
we're divided by religions.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I put a cell
in the field, and I say,

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
what's controlling it?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I say the energy from the field.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I now split my cell
into three different cells.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a Christian cell, a
Muslim cell, and a Jewish cell.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh yes, each one of
these are different cells.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I say, and what's
different about it?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
All of the cells came
from the same source.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
What's different
is the programming

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of the cells in the
first seven years.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So a real important
insight into this

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is all people on this
planet are connected

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:90%
to the original source.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's only programming
that separates us

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
into different
factions that breaks up

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
the harmony of this planet.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
If we all understood we all
came from the same source,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:84%
it would change human behavior
to a very positive side,

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to create harmony and
community among all humans

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, this sounds a little
far-fetched, of course.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The question is, is there
any other foundation

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
besides Bruce talking
about this that

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
suggests the real scientific
foundation for spirituality?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to offer a
very important publication

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:84%
in the journal "Nature",
the most prestigious journal

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is an article published
by a professor of physics

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
at Johns Hopkins,
Richard Conn Henry.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And he is talking about the
nature of quantum physics.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this article, Richard
Conn Henry says, look,

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
when quantum physics
was first established,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
it was understood that
consciousness was influencing

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:90%
the character of our lives.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important
for me is the conclusion

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that he offered.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:90%
The universe is immaterial.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It's mental and spiritual.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.515 align:middle line:90%
Live and enjoy.

00:27:35.515 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And for me, this is
profoundly important,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:10%
because it's actually published
in the most prestigious

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:10%
scientific journal on the
planet that we are actually

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:10%
spiritual, mental entities
creating our lives.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, now
that you understand

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the energy
field, what does this

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
mean for our lifespan?

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:10%
The role of telomeres
and the enzyme telomerase

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.410 align:middle line:10%
suggests that with the right
lifestyle and consciousness,

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:10%
this longevity might
actually be attainable.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:90%
We may live more than 100 years.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, science
now recognizes

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
that a human should
live at least 150 years

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:90%
as a normal lifespan.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's because, as
long as we can replicate

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the stem cells, we can keep
replacing the cells that

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:90%
are dying on a daily basis.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And that will allow
us to stay alive.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the realization
of a spiritual identity

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that transcends life
would profoundly

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
influence the
character of our lives

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and how we relate to the planet
and especially to other humans.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we're going to focus

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
on fractal geometry, the
mathematics governing

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
the structure of
the physical realm.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
The presentation will include
some important insights

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:84%
acquired from the
life of a cell that we

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
can use to enhance our
own human experience.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining me,
