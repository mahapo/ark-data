00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.540 align:middle line:10%
>> In the early 1800s, French
biologist Jean-Baptiste de

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.920 align:middle line:10%
Lamarck said, "It is not the
organs that is the character

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and form of the animals' bodily
parts that have given rise

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:10%
to its habits.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:84%
It is the habits
and manner of life

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in which its ancestors lived
that fashions its bodily form,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:90%
its organs, and its qualities."

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:90%
What was Lamarck referring to?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And why did Charles Darwin
paint a different picture?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I am your host, Bruce
Lipton, for the series

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:90%
on Inner Evolution.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:84%
The notion that genes
control our lives

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
was first predicated on
Newtonian materialism.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
Science was seeking
the physical basis

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, the search for the
genesis elements as an insight

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
into understanding the
mechanisms that control life.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
This pursuit led to the
Human Genome Project.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
In what amounted
to a cosmic joke,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the project's results completely
undermined the assumption

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that genes control evolution
and the character of life.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:84%
The door was now open for the
new and personally empowering

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
science of epigenetics.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you how
science has evolved

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and how this understanding may
have affected your own thought

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
patterning.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Science is really based
on the physical expression

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
of the universe as
proposed by Isaac Newton.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And being a physical
mechanism, then

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
insight into
understanding how it works

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
would give us insight
into controlling it.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we really have to
recognize that there was

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:90%
a mission to modern science.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
This mission was proposed
by Francis Bacon in 1650

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to obtain knowledge that can
be used to dominate and control

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
This has been the
mission of science.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where we are
always in an effort

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to try to show
nature what we want,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than understanding
what nature is offering us

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.576 align:middle line:84%
Now, to understand evolution,
we must first go back to 1809.

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was the printing of
the first scientific paper

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
on evolution by
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Lemarck's theory of evolution
in today's light of science

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:10%
is probably the
most accurate one.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Lamarck recognized
the very simple fact

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that animals and environments
were in a perfect lockstep

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:90%
orientation.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Polar bears are not
in South America.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And orchids are
not in Antarctica.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Was that chance or accident?

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Not according to Lamarck.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Lamarck actually
came up with the idea

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
lockstep interaction

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
between the environment and
the evolution of the organisms.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, this theory got lost
for a very important reason.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
Lamarck was only

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:84%
able to offer this new science
in the French Revolution

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
when Napoleon took over.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But when Napoleon lost and
the aristocrats and the church

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
came back into power, they
eliminated Lamarck immediately

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:90%
as a heretic.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
However, in 1859, a theory of
evolution by Charles Darwin

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%
was published--

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
"On the Origin of Species
by Natural Selection."

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to make a very
important correction

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
at this moment for this
fact, because we give credit

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:90%
to Darwin for the theory.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The truth is it was Alfred
Russel Wallace, a commoner

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
working in the Malay
Archipelago, that actually

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
wrote the theory of evolution
and sent it to Charles Darwin.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Darwin was taken
back by the fact

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that someone had already
written this theory.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't finish his
effort of writing his theory.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, Charles Lyell, head
of the Royal Society,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and Darwin got together.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:10%
And under what they referred
to as the delicate arrangement,

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:10%
they put Darwin's name in front
of Alfred Russel Wallace's name

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:10%
when presenting the theories
at the Linnean Society meeting

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:10%
back in 1858.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The significance is profound,
because priority is always

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:90%
given to the first author.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Darwin took the work
and within the year,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
came out with his book,
"On the Origin of Species."

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And Wallace-- lost in history.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the significance of
Darwin writing the theory

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:84%
is quite different than
understanding Alfred Russel

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Wallace's perception.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Wallace, a commoner-- when he
saw the understanding of how

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
animals in the world
work together and compete

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
with each other, actually
came to the conclusion

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that evolution was based on
the elimination of the weakest

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:90%
organisms in the community.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:10%
Darwin, an upper-class
person and in supporting

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:10%
the upper-class philosophy,
changed that around

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:10%
and said that
evolution is actually

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:10%
driven by the survival of the
fittest and the competition.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So Wallace said it was
elimination of the weakest.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Darwin said it was the
preservation of the strongest.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
They both have the
same conclusion.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
The glass is half empty,
or the glass is half full,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
but they have profoundly
different meanings.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if I give
you a chance to live

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
in either of two worlds,
an Alfred Russel Wallace

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
world where only the
weakest get eliminated

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
or a Darwinian world where
only the strongest survive,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%
which one would you pick?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:90%
The answer is simple.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It's easiest to be in the
Alfred Russel Wallace--

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's easiest
not to be the weakest.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's much harder to be the
strongest as in a Darwin world.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But Darwin was the first
one to write his book,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:90%
"On the Origin of Species."

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And since then, the world has
been taken by the understanding

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.138 align:middle line:84%
that it is a competition
for survival on this planet.

00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in
trying to understand

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
the nature of evolution, we must
first go back to Isaac Newton.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:90%
And the significance is this.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In Isaac Newton's universe,
the physical, material realm

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
can only be affected by
other forms of matter.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in
trying to understand

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
how a human body works,
and the human body being

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
a physical machine, it was
understood that somewhere

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
in that body there were physical
elements that controlled

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:90%
the character of that machine.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And when Darwin came
up with this idea,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
there was no insider
understanding

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of genes.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a philosophy that there
were some kinds of structures

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
like paint droplets
scattered through the body,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and that these droplets
were called gemmules.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And these gemmules carried
the nature or character

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of the part of the body
where they were located.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So there would be a
gemmule in your shoulder

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that would accommodate
the shoulder,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
a gemmule in your neck that
would program and develop

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:90%
the neck.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So gemmules were scattered
all over the body.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When two people
mated, the gemmules

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
of the mother and the
gemmules of the father

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
would come and blend together
to create the characteristic

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
of their offspring.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
In searching for those physical
elements, the gemmules,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
we were looking for
the genesis elements.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And genesis elements can
be abbreviated as genes.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the term
genes comes from, OK?

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
So the significance is this.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Darwin's theory was
a two-step process.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Step 1-- there's an
alteration in the heredity,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that the so-called
gemmules would

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
alter their characteristic
which, in turn, would alter

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
the characteristic of the body
in which these gemmules were

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
found, followed by step
2, natural selection,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
where nature will select the
strongest of those altered

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
organisms to survive, and
propagate those genes,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate the weaker
organisms that have been

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:90%
altered by these genes.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
gemmules, of course,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
was an elusive idea, because it
was just an idea, a philosophy.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing real to
identify the hereditary units.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly
enough, at the same time

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:10%
that Darwin was working on
the theory of evolution,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:10%
in Austria there was a monk
by the name of Gregor Mendel.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:10%
And Mendel was mating
flowers of different colors.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And what he showed is if
he mated a red flowering

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
plant with a white
flowering plant,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:90%
the offspring would be pink.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, this would suggest
that the characteristic

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
in the red plant-- its gemmules
merged with the gemmules

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:90%
in the white plant created pink.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:90%
So that fit the general story.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But a whole new
insight was offered

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
when Mendel did back
crossing, where he mated two

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:90%
of the pink offspring together.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Not only did pink flowers
show up on plants,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
but there were plants with
white flowers and plants

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:90%
with red flowers.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:90%
This is profoundly important.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it said that whatever
the hereditary elements were,

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
they were very specific
physical units.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They didn't merge
with each other

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:90%
as gemmules were supposed to do.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:90%
They kept their characteristics.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But when present together,
a red and white one

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:90%
would create a pink plant.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But when you back
cross, any plant

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that received two white
genes would be white.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And any plant that received
two red genes would be red.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And the pink was the
result of a plant having

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
one of each of the genes.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
The point is very critical.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Because it said that whatever
the hereditary units are,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:10%
their physical,
discrete units, not

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:10%
like paint droplets
that merge, but maintain

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:10%
their characteristic from
generation to generation.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, that put the search on.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:84%
What in an organism represents
these new structures, which

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:90%
are now referred to as genes?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
What is a gene?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Where is a gene?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, in 1892, August
Weismann, a German scientist

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:10%
in studying cells
and tissue culture,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:10%
observed as cells
divided, there were

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:10%
these little filaments
that were found

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the cell.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:10%
Those filaments were
split half and half,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:10%
one half going to one daughter
cell, the other half going

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:10%
to the other daughter cell.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
By following these filaments
over and over again,

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:84%
he identified them
first as chromosomes

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and then recognized that these
chromosomes were actually

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
the hereditary units.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So now, there was a
physical basis of,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
where is the hereditary unit?

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Where are the genes?

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
to the chromosomes.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, science was going
to try to understand

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
the nature of genes.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
But here's the first problem.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Chromosomes are consisting
of 50% protein and 50% DNA.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, science didn't know.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Was it the protein that
was a hereditary unit?

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:10%
Or was it the DNA that
was a hereditary unit?

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, that answer
actually didn't

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:90%
get worked out until 1944.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
time science recognized

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that DNA was the element
responsible for heredity.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
How did that experiment work?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, Avery,
MacLeod, and McCarty

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
did this experiment with two
types of bacteria, a type R

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
bacteria, which created
little point-like colonies

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in a culture dish, just
like little periods

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%
all over the culture dish.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:10%
The other species they
looked at was type S,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:10%
but these formed big
puddle-like colonies.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:10%
And what they wanted to find out
is that the chromosomal protein

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:10%
or the chromosomal DNA that
is determining the character

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:10%
of these colonies.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
separated the chromosome

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
from type S into its
protein component,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:90%
into its DNA component.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did is they first

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:84%
added the protein
from the chromosome

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:90%
to a culture of type R bacteria.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:90%
The result?

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It was the same
bacterial colonies

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:84%
type R always had-- the small,
little point-like colonies.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
However, the surprise
came when they

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
put the DNA from the type S
chromosome into the culture

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:90%
with type R.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Because what happened-- the
type R cultures were transformed

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:10%
to express the big puddle-like
colonies of type S.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:10%
It was this first
experiment to identify

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:10%
that DNA was carrying
the hereditary character

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:10%
in an organism.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, now we know DNA.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:90%
But how does DNA work?

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew-- had any idea
about DNA and its mechanism.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
That took another nine years.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, the answer
of how DNA works

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
was provided in the journal,
"Nature," by Watson and Crick.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And Watson and Crick had
been given all the credit

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
for understanding that
DNA is a double helix

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and encodes a gene program to
provide for the characteristics

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:90%
of an organism.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make
a point right here--

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:90%
it's very important--

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.195 align:middle line:84%
that Watson and Crick were
actually not the real founders

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
of the DNA double helix.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:10%
It was a woman,
Rosalind Franklin,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:10%
who through her research
on DNA molecules,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:10%
first showed the picture
of an X-ray, characteristic

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:10%
of a DNA double helix.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, Rosalind
Franklin's major advisor

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
gave her research results
to Watson and Crick

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
without even telling Rosalind
Franklin that he did it.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:10%
It was that research that
led to Watson and Crick

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:10%
coming forth with the famous DNA
double helix picture in 1953.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we started to
understand the nature of DNA,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
we started to recognize that
it is what is programming

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:90%
the character of an individual.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It is responsible for heredity
and now comes a serious issue.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Because the chromosomes
carrying these genes, which

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
control our character--
well, we get them

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
from our mother and our father
at the moment of conception.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as we know,
we didn't pick the genes

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:90%
that we were born with.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we know,
we can't change the genes

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
if we don't like
the characteristics.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And a piece of research
led us into another belief

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:90%
that disempowered us further.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was, how
is DNA controlled?

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Because DNA apparently
is the blueprint

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to make the proteins
of the body.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go back a step.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Physical anatomy of any
organism or any cell

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
is based on the proteins.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The proteins are
the building blocks

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that provide the structure and
characteristics of the body.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Through the work of
Watson and Crick,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
now we understand that DNA
codes for the structure

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:90%
of those proteins.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:10%
So DNA is the carrying
elements of heredity.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, the issue was,
what controls the DNA?

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where it all went
wrong for this simple reason.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:90%
DNA is a double helix molecule.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
In an early
experiment, scientists

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
split the double helix
into single helices.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is
incubate it with the building

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:90%
blocks of DNA.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they pulled
out the single strand,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
no longer was it
a single strand.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, it was double stranded DNA.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God, they said.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
DNA programs for its
own reproduction.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they said,
yes, genes turn on and off,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and regulate
themselves, and also

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:84%
are the hereditary blueprints to
make the proteins of the body.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, they said,
yep, genes turn on and off

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:90%
and control life.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And we bought that belief.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.878 align:middle line:84%
So now, I go back and
say, A, as far as we know,

00:16:34.878 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:90%
we didn't pick the genes.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
B, we can't change the
genes if we don't like

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:90%
the characteristics we have.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, C, genes turn
on and off by themselves.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, you put that all
together and you realize

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
your fate is not in your hands.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Your fate is in the
DNA that you receive.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The character of your
life is programmed

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of
conception when you

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:84%
receive the genes from your
mother and your father.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, science got
all excited by this.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they started
to recognize,

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
if we could identify all the
genes that make up a human,

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
then what we can do is
use them as medicine

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and give them to people
that have genetic defects.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:10%
And so interestingly enough,
the Human Genome Project

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:10%
got off the ground.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:90%
A very important fact is this--

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the Human Genome
Project was created

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
by the pharmaceutical industry
for a very simple reason.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it was
anticipated that there

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
were going to be over
100,000 human genes.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are over
100,000 proteins.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And each protein is
created by a gene.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So basic conclusion is there's
got to be 100,000 genes just

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
to make the proteins.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So the project gets
off the ground.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Who is interested in it?

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Pharmaceutical industry.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
100,000 proteins
means 100,000 genes,

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:90%
which means 100,000 new drugs.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Only one slight problem.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:90%
And that was this--

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
they encouraged the public
to pay for this research.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Our tax dollars went
in billions of dollars

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to identify the 100,000
genes in the human genome.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Every gene that
had been identified

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:84%
has now been patented
by drug companies.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Your genes are actually
owned by other people,

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and you paid for it.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But I love it, because
nature didn't really

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
like that idea of the
Human Genome Project

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, us being
controlled by these genes.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
While the Genome Project
was getting off the ground,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
they anticipated, again,
over 100,000 human genes.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
As they started to do
the genome of organisms,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
they recognized
one important fact.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
In evolution, there's
an ancient picture

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
of what is called the tree of
evolution, the tree of life.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And on that tree is the
organisms on this planet,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
displayed in a hierarchy of
more advanced and more advanced

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:90%
organisms.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So starting at the
bottom of the tree,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
the most primitive organisms
on the planet-- bacteria.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you go up the
tree, the organisms

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
become more and more
and more complex,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
until you get to
the top of the tree

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
where, presumably,
we are located.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't start by
working with the human genome

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:90%
with over 100,000 genes.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:84%
You start while working with
more primitive organisms

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
with fewer genes,
just to test out

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism of
counting how many genes

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:90%
are present in an organism.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first organism
they worked with

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
was a miniature worm called
Caenorhabditis elegans.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
The name is this big,
but the worm is this big.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
The worm is less than a
1/2 a millimeter in length.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:10%
The worm has 1,271 cells.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:10%
That is a very
primitive organism.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:10%
And that was really
the first organism

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:10%
that they decided to
see how many genes were

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:10%
in the genome of that organism.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:10%
It turns out,
about 20,000 genes.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, hey, that fit
science's vision--

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
small, primitive organism,
fewer number of genes.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But as we go up the
tree, as more complexity

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
is encountered, greater
number of genes.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The next organism they
checked the genome on

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
was the fruit fly.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You're all aware of that.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the fly that
geneticists have

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
been using for a hundred years
to study the role of breeding

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and genetics and controlling
the character of an organism.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fruit fly is
profoundly more complex

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
than Caenorhabditis
elegans worm.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they did the genome,
they were in for a shock.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Because this very complex
organism had apparently

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
only 15,000 genes, 5,000 genes
less than the primitive worm

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
they studied first.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:90%
That didn't cause them to stop.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
They were full speed ahead to
do the Human Genome Project.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And around 2001, the
results come out.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.823 align:middle line:84%
And it blows everybody's
mind, because they

00:21:10.823 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
started with the
premise there are

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:90%
going to be over 100,000 genes.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:10%
20,000 genes, the same
number of genes in a 1,271

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:10%
celled miniature worm as
there are in a 50 trillion

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:10%
celled human body.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Point is very clear.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Reading the genes
does not determine

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
the character of evolution.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Genes are not the
measurement of evolution.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we have
to take another look and say,

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
but, what is evolution based on
if it's not based on the genes?

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, Watson and Crick were
the ones that came up, finally,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
with this double helix
and understanding

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the genetic
code that codes for proteins.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And what Crick
started to recognize

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is information flows
in a one-way direction.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
It starts with DNA.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The blueprints turned
into RNA, which is

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:90%
like a Xerox copy of the gene.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And the RNA copy
is actually used

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to program the creation
of the proteins.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That information only flows
in one direction from DNA

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:90%
to RNA to protein.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a very important
conclusion for this reason.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I say, what does it mean?

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The information only
flows in one way.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And I go, yes.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I say, who are we?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.920 align:middle line:90%
We are the protein organisms.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I go, then the
significance is what?

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, DNA, RNA protein
flow of information.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:10%
Protein cannot go back
and influence the DNA.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Information only goes one way.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:10%
So as protein organisms,
we have no influence

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:10%
in our genetic activity.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:10%
The genes are in control, and
information flows downward.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, this leads us
to an understanding

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that science offered,
called genetic determinism,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.977 align:middle line:84%
the belief that genes determine
the character of your life.

00:23:12.977 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
When you go back to
the central dogma,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:84%
then you recognize
genes determine

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
the character of your life, and
you have no influence over it.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.553 align:middle line:84%
That's why we become
victims of our heredity.

00:23:24.553 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
There's an important
thing to understand here.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is this--

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
we kept saying that
genes turn on and off.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is this--

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
a gene is a blueprint
to make a protein.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what it is.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And I say, why is it relevant?

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Go into an architect's office.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:90%
She's working on a blueprint.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Lean over her shoulder and say,
is your blueprint on or off?

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
She would look at
you like, what?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a blueprint.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:90%
There is no "on and off."

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Genes are blueprints.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
They do not turn
themselves on and off.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The whole experiment where they
put a single DNA molecule in

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and pulled out a double helix--

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
well, that experiment is
misleading for a very important

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Because they use pure DNA.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.687 align:middle line:84%
And remember, a chromosome
is 50% protein and 50% DNA.

00:24:20.687 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
working with pure DNA,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
then you really don't see
how a chromosome works.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, it is the
proteins in the chromosome

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:90%
that are the absolute control.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Science has confused two terms,
which has been propagated

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:90%
by the media all the time.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The two terms are
causation and correlation.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
genes causing things.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And genes are
correlated with things.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
But here's the difference.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Causation means the act or
agency that controls something.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Correlation means
something that's

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
associated with
a characteristic.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:90%
So the point is this.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Do genes cause things?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer to that
is, can they turn on and off

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and then initiate a response?

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:90%
The answer is absolutely not.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Genes cannot turn on and off.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
They are simply
blueprints and yet, they

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:90%
are correlated with things.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:90%
We talk about a cancer gene.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there a gene
that causes cancer?

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:90%
No, not one gene causes cancer.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Are genes correlated
with cancer?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They are correlated, but
they do not cause the cancer.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And why this
becomes important is

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
we've attributed almost all
our diseases to our genes.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out, this
is totally incorrect.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Less than 10% of the disease,
and probably closer to 1%

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
of disease, is even
connected to genes.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone on the wrong
track for a long time,

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
looking for the genes
as causing things.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, I must admit.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
There are six
major diseases that

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
are caused by a single gene.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:10%
And let's just list
them right now--

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:10%
hemophilia, cystic fibrosis,
Huntington's disease,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:10%
Tay-Sachs disease,
Marfan syndrome,

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:10%
and hereditary hemochromatosis,
a blood disease.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:10%
Each of those six diseases
is caused by a single gene.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:10%
If you have that gene, then you
have a high, high probability

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:10%
of experiencing that disease.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:90%
But the simple reality is this.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Almost all other diseases
such as cancer, for example,

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:90%
are caused by multiple genes.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And since genes don't turn
themselves on and off,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they're actually caused by
multiple characteristics

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of the environment
in which we live.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
now we have to recognize

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
genes are not causing most of
the diseases on this planet.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:90%
In fact, less than 10%.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And now, the
significance is this.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The idea that DNA
controls our life

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is incorrect, that
DNA is actually

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:08.725 align:middle line:84%
manipulated by the chromosomes'
other component, the protein.

00:27:08.725 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Because ever since
Watson and Crick,

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
50 years of research, scientists
isolate the chromosome,

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
keep the DNA for the
experiment, and have thrown away

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:90%
the protein.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But now that we're understanding
the nature of the protein,

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:90%
there is a new insight.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And the insight is simply this.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:10%
The flow of information
is not as it

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:10%
says in the central dogma--

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:10%
one-way DNA, RNA protein.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:10%
We now know that the flow
goes in both directions.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Protein can influence RNA.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And RNA can go back
and change DNA.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.610 align:middle line:84%
That means our life
characteristics

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:90%
as protein bodies--

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.910 align:middle line:84%
we can use our life and go
back and change the genes

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.290 align:middle line:90%
that we came with.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, then, we're
not the read-out of our genes.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Because we can change our genes.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Every gene blueprint
can give rise

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to over 3,000 different
versions of proteins

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
from the very same
gene blueprint,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:90%
because of epigenetics.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Our next episode reveals
how we're not victims,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
but we are masters in
controlling our gene

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.820 align:middle line:90%
characteristics.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:90%
