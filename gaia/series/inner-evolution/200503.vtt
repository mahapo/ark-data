00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Internalized body cells
must adjust their genetics

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors to
accommodate external,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:90%
outer world environments.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle line:84%
How do our bodies respond to the
environment in our outer world?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.271 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on inner evolution.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:10%
Amoebas and other
single-celled organisms

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:10%
live independently
in and directly

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:10%
respond to the conditions in
their outer world environment.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.550 align:middle line:84%
However, cells in an
animal, such as a human,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
live within a separate
internal environment.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The human skin, the
functional equivalent

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of the cell membrane,
is the source

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system that links
the inner cellular environment

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:90%
with the outer world.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system reads
the environmental signals,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:84%
while the mind interprets
these signals and sends

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:84%
regulatory
information internally

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
to control the genetics
and behavior of our cells

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and organs.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:84%
The mind has two interdependent
elements, the conscious

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and the subconscious minds.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind is connected
to your personal identity,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:90%
your spirituality.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:90%
This mind is a creative mind.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
mind is a database

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:90%
of stored behavioral programs.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:10%
This session will describe
the functional differences

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:10%
between these two minds and how
they learn in different ways.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with how the
fate of a cell is determined.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:10%
As been described in
previous episodes,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:10%
my studies on stem
cells and tissue culture

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:10%
revealed a very important
fact, that the fate

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:10%
of these cells in
the culture dish

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:10%
was actually dependent on
the chemistry of the culture

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:10%
medium.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, the significance of
this is that culture medium

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:10%
is the equivalent of blood.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, how does this relate
to the cells in our own body?

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, first understand
this very important fact.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
A human is not a
single organism.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
A human body is a
skin-covered culture dish

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
with 50 trillion cells, and the
original culture medium, blood,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:90%
contains information.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's the composition
of this blood

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.328 align:middle line:84%
that actually will determine
the fate of the cells.

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are two
important components in blood

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:90%
that we must consider.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Number one, blood
provides nutrition.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in the laboratory,
I use the best ingredients

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
possible to manifest
culture medium

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
for a very simple reason.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:10%
If I compromise on
the ingredients,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:10%
the cells actually suffer.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:10%
If I feed them culture medium
with less than the best culture

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:10%
ingredients, the cells
actually begin to get sick,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.138 align:middle line:10%
and they will die.

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is relevant
to us as well,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:10%
because, since we are creating
culture medium, blood,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:10%
we want to make the best culture
medium possible, which then

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:10%
means we should really just
eat organic, natural foods,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:10%
because industrial
farm foods are

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:10%
filled with toxic elements
that will negatively

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:10%
affect the cells.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So a diet of wholesome food is
important in creating the best

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
culture medium for ourselves.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to
nutrition, culture medium

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:90%
can change information.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And this information includes
hormones, growth factors,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
emotional chemicals.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we should recognize
that a human body

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is adjusting and responding to
the environment at all times.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So there are actually
an external environment

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that has to be understood as
well as an internal environment

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.572 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, who reads
these environments?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
the nervous system.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:10%
The brain represents
perception of the environment.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And as the brain
reads the environment,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
it can release neurochemicals,
hormones, emotional chemicals

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
into the body that
will control the fate

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to organize it to be in
harmony with whatever

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of
the environment are.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:10%
So a very important
result is that the brain

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:10%
is interpreting the
environment, and that's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:10%
what controls our cells.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So simply, environmental
signals are

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
what are responsible
for controlling

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:90%
the fate of our biology.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, when we talk about animals
in general, this holds true.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But as we get into
higher organisms

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in the evolutionary
tree, guess what?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a new,
additional device

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
that is interpreting the
environmental signals,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and that is the mind.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
The mind is an interpretation
of what the brain perceives.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And the significance of
that is, well, each of us

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:90%
have different minds.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Each of us can look at the world
and respond a different way

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
to the same environment.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So in looking at the sequence
of flow of information,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
environmental signals are picked
up by the brain as perception.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The mind does an interpretation
of these environmental signals

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and then releases chemistry,
such as hormones, growth

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
factors, emotional
chemicals, that

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
will coordinate our body to
conform to the environment

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's actually
belief which

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is the representation of
the mind's perceptions

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:90%
that control our biology.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:10%
Our thoughts release
neurochemicals,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:10%
and these agents
control our biology.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
To give you a simple
example of how this works,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to use a
cartoon of the brain.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:10%
And in this cartoon,
what you see

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:10%
is the brain is holding a
flask of culture medium, which

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:10%
is actually blood, and
it's feeding the cells

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:10%
in our skin-covered dish with
this blood culture medium.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
If the mind is perceiving
love, then the interpretation

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
of that environment
representing love

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
causes the brain to release
chemistry that actually

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:90%
complements that perception.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:10%
So the brain releases some
very important chemistry

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:10%
into the blood to
control our biology.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:10%
Included in this chemistry
is dopamine, a hormone

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:10%
that gives us pleasure.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:10%
In addition, the brain releases
a hormone called oxytocin.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:10%
This hormone actually
causes us to bind

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:10%
with the source of that love.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So this allows parents
and children to bond

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:90%
together because of that love.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:10%
In addition, when
you're in love,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:10%
the brain also
releases vasopressin.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:10%
This is another
hormone that actually

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:10%
causes us to be more
attractive to our partner.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In turn, this keeps the
love lasting a lot longer.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And lastly, when you're
in love, the brain

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:10%
releases growth hormone.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:10%
And growth hormone, as the name
implies, enhances our vitality.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:10%
So very simply, the cocktail
of chemicals released

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:10%
by the brain when
we're experiencing love

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:10%
is released into the blood,
the culture medium that

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:10%
influences our cells.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:90%
The result is this.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
When people fall in
love, they're healthier.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:90%
They glow.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.945 align:middle line:90%
People can even say, "Look.

00:07:31.945 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at these people.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
You can see how
they're in love by just

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:90%
looking at their physiology."

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Love enhances our
growth and our vitality.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:10%
However, if you
open up your eyes,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and you see something that
scares you in the environment,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:10%
well, that experience of fear
causes a completely different

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:10%
set of chemicals to be released
by the brain, and as a result,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:10%
changes the behavior profoundly,
because the blood is now

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:10%
containing information other
than information about love.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:10%
So for example,
when you're in fear,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:10%
you release stress hormones such
as cortisol, norepinephrine.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:10%
These hormones actually change
the circulation of the body

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:10%
and put us not into
a growth phase,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:10%
but actually prepare
us for fight or flight

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:10%
and actually to save
our lives and what

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:10%
fear we are perceiving.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:10%
In addition, fear
also causes chemicals

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:10%
that interfere with
our immune system

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:10%
to be released into the
blood, and then this

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:10%
shuts down the immune
system and actually leads

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:10%
to illness when we are living
in what is called chronic fear.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The consequence of
this is very important,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
because it really
represents this.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
The function of our
mind is to create

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
coherence between our
beliefs and our reality.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you believe there

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
is something to be afraid
of, then the mind's job

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is to create a behavior
that will actually

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
make a correlation or coherence
between that belief of fear

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and the reality that
we're experiencing.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
When you are experiencing
love, well, then the function

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of the mind is to
manifest the chemistry

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
to control our behavior so that
we can experience that love.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Point is simple.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:10%
Whatever programs we possess
about our perceptions

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:10%
of the planet, the
function of the mind

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:10%
is to create behavior
that makes our life

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:10%
coherent with our beliefs.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
This is actually not
a new idea at all.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's 2,500 years old.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha actually said,
"What we think, we become."

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is actually
what's going on

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:10%
as our thought processes adjust
the chemistry of our biology,

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:10%
which in turn
adjust our behavior,

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:10%
and then, in result,
whatever our thoughts are,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:10%
we will become
that in the world.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
this for many years,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:90%
actually, since 1985.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And conventional
science has really

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:84%
resisted everything
I've said about that.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But then again, in 1990s,
the new idea of epigenetics

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
came in, and also, in
the current time now,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%
science is also
beginning to recognize

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
how our consciousness
is creating

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:90%
the character of our lives.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, to give you a quote
from Steve Cole, researcher

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:10%
at the University of California
Los Angeles Medical School,

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:10%
this is what he said in a paper,
and it's profoundly important.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
"To an extent that immunologists
and psychologists rarely

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
appreciate, we are architects
of our own experience."

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to say, "Your
subjective experience carries

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:84%
more power than your
objective situation."

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, that last sentence
is a little bit complex,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:84%
because I can change it and make
it much more profoundly simple

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
in this regard.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's rewrite it
as the following.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
"Your belief carries more
power than your reality."

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is the profound,
important understanding

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
of how our belief is actually
creating our life experiences.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's all
influenced by the mind.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we say the
mind, a lot of people

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
think, well, that's a
single thing, the mind.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually
incorrect, because the mind

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is comprised of two subunits,
the conscious and subconscious

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:90%
minds.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
These are two
different entities.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, the conscious
and subconscious minds

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:90%
have different functions.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And very importantly, the
conscious and subconscious

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
minds learn in different ways.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The function of
the conscious mind?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the latest
evolution of the brain.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a lobe
of neural tissue

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:90%
right behind your forehead.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
prefrontal cortex.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the seat of your
personal identity, your source,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
or your spirituality.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
The character of the
conscious mind is creativity.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, then, what is
the role of the conscious mind?

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's to manifest our wishes,
our desires, our aspirations.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious
mind is the seat

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.152 align:middle line:84%
of positive thinking, which
profoundly changes our lives.

00:12:27.152 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, "Come
on, that positive thinking

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:90%
can't be real."

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
The understanding of
the placebo effect

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
goes back nearly 100 years.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:90%
What is the placebo effect?

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a positive belief
about a medical drug

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
or a medical therapy
where someone

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
thinks that the drug or
therapy is going to heal them.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
They believe it's
going to heal them.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They take the magic pill,
get better, and then

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
find out that the pill
was just a sugar pill.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
you have to ask them,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
what made them better?

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, it
wasn't the sugar pill.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
It was the belief
in the sugar pill

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that is responsible
for the placebo

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.522 align:middle line:90%
effect, a positive belief.

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very
important, because it really

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
emphasizes the nature of how
our thoughts are manifesting

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%
our life experiences.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't
understand is this.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Negative thoughts
are equally powerful

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:84%
but work in the
opposite direction.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
In medicine, the term
for negative thoughts

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:90%
is the nocebo effect.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Interesting point--
a negative thought

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
can cause any illness
on this planet.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It can even cause
a person to die.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's the power of thought
that actually is controlling

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:90%
the character of our lives.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind-- creative,
wishes, desires, aspirations.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're looking for.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, the
subconscious mind,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.610 align:middle line:84%
which represents about
90% of the brain,

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent of a
record-playback mechanism.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It records behaviors, and then,
when we need that behavior,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:90%
it's just like pushing a button.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It will automatically play.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is really important,
because the subconscious'

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:84%
programs actually facilitate
the character of our lives.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Give you a simple example.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:90%
When did you learn how to walk?

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Before you were
two years of age.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have to
relearn how to walk?

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately, no, for
the simple reason is this.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Once the programming
of walking is installed

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious
mind as a program,

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
you don't even have to
say, "I'm going to walk."

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You just have the
intention of moving.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:84%
The brain will automatically
engage the walking program

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and carry it out for
you automatically.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So subconscious mind
is really pretty cool,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because what it does is
it saves us a lot of time

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
from relearning things
over and over again.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.083 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we didn't have a
subconscious mind, every day,

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up,
guess what you'd

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:90%
have to first learn how to do?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Walk.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we'd never
get anywhere that way.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very efficient
and very convenient.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
problem with that.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
What if some of the programs
in the subconscious mind

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:90%
are negative?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Then we go, well, there is a
problem, because that means,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
automatically, when
stimulated, these programs

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are not going to take us
in a positive direction.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
They will actually undermine
the character of our lives.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious is a
record-playback device.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:90%
It's habitual.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
That's its main thing, as
compared to creativity,

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the function
of the conscious mind.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So the habits of the
subconscious mind,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%
where do they come from?

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the
habits are genetic,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because those are
called instincts.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
If something flies
towards your face,

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
you will automatically
blink your eye.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not learned.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a built-in instinct.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly-- and
we're going to emphasize this--

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is that many of the programs
in the subconscious mind,

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we actually didn't
personally experience.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of the programs
were actually

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
acquired by observing
other people

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:90%
and downloading their behavior.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
They were actually created by
observing our mother, father,

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
our family, and our community.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
These are acquired behaviors.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:90%
So why should we have programs?

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll give you
a simple example.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
If you buy a
brand-new computer, it

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:90%
will have an operating system.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I say, great.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's activate the computer.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Yep, you can activate it.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The operating system will kick
it in, get it ready to go.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Then I say, OK, let's
do something with it.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:90%
How about writing?

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how about making a drawing?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I say, wait.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you need?

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
You need programs to
carry out these functions.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, as a
child is developing,

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
it has already a built-in
system to operate.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
have any programs.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It has to acquire programs in
order for it to be functional.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So I go, oh, so we
download programs,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and then we can use these
programs to carry out

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.935 align:middle line:90%
our lives.

00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's an
interesting story

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:84%
about the downloading
of programs,

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
that during the last
trimester of pregnancy

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and the first seven
years of life,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
our brain is not operating at
the level of consciousness.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
That's a higher
functional vibration.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
Vibration-- oh, you
can read that when

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
you put wires on your head.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It's called an
electroencephalograph.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
There are all different
levels of vibration.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The lowest vibration
is called delta.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the vibration
of the brain when

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
it's sleeping or unconscious.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:10%
The next higher level of
vibration is called theta.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Theta is characterized
as imagination.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Then the next higher
vibration is actually

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of consciousness.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:90%
That vibration is called alpha.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It's actually calm
consciousness.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, there's
still a higher vibration

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that we normally use
during our work experiences

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:90%
or during our education.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And that higher
vibration is called beta.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.904 align:middle line:84%
That's like focused
schoolroom consciousness.

00:18:03.904 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't start out
with all these vibrations.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
As a child, we begin
with the lowest vibration

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
when we're born, which is delta,
because a child spends most

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:90%
of its first year sleeping.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So its brain is not
really functioning

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:90%
at that higher level.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But after the first
year, the child's brain

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
starts to ramp up to the
next vibration, called theta.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So as a child's
brain's developing,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:84%
it's actually got an
operating system in it.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
But there are no programs.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, when
does actual programming start?

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a very
interesting fact.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Programming starts even
before the child is born.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, how can a
child that's still in utero

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:90%
be programmed?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is related to
something called the placenta.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And the placenta
is the interface

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
between the mother's blood
and the fetus' blood,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
because the mother's blood is
what contains the nutrition

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that, when it crosses
into the placenta,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
will nourish the
developing fetus.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I mentioned, blood
has more than just nutrition.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
In the last trimester
of pregnancy,

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
the information in
the mother's blood

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is transferred along
with the nutrition.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:84%
If the mother's in love,
wonderful information

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
such as dopamine,
growth hormone,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
this stuff is going
into the fetus as well.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
However, if the
mother is experiencing

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
problems in her world--

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
she's not supported,
there's a lack of love--

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:84%
well, the fetus
may not understand

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
the reasons of what's going on.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The fetus does read the
information, the hormones that

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
go in, stress hormones versus
love hormones, for example.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And I say, then what's relevant?

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The child in utero in the
last trimester of pregnancy

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:90%
is learning from pattern.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
If the mother is in fear, or if
the mother is in stress, well,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
those chemicals also go
into the body of the fetus

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and adjust the genetics
via epigenetics.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So the mother's
experience is actually

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
adjusting the genetics
of her own fetus

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:90%
through epigenetic mechanisms.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So a fetus is getting what is
called a head start program.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.213 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important point
in development for this reason.

00:20:21.213 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:84%
When a mother is
born, she already

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
has the eggs for
all her generations

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
that she can create.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I go, yeah, but she won't have
a baby for, let's say, 20 years.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.965 align:middle line:90%
And I say, relevant?

00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole
world's situation

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:90%
can change in 20 years.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So when it's time
to have a baby,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the egg isn't really
programmed to respond

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%
to the outside environment.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
This is very important,
because the baby's biology

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to
encourage it or allow

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:84%
it to survive in
whatever environment,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
a peaceful environment or
a war-torn environment.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that happens before
the baby's even born.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:90%
It's already being programmed.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, if the father
is talking to the fetus

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
as it's developing,
and the baby is born,

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and the father says
something, the baby

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
will immediately
identify the father

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
who talked to it through
the abdominal wall.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
However, once the
baby is born, now it's

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the outside
environment directly.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.915 align:middle line:84%
In the first year or
so of the baby's life,

00:21:22.915 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not really responding
to the environment

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that much, mainly because,
most of that time,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the baby is sleeping
in the first year.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But by the beginning
of the second year,

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the baby is now very
responsive to what's

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
going on in the environment,
but it's in a state

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
called theta, a lower
vibration than consciousness.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The characteristic of
theta is imagination.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is exactly
what children under seven

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:90%
are really good at.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
They can have a tea party,
pour nothing into a cup,

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
drink nothing, and talk about
how wonderful the tea was.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Or a child could ride a
broom, thinking it's a horse.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, it's riding
a broom in the child's mind.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Imagination via theta is
actually turning that broom

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
into a real horse.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The mother says,
"Give me the broom."

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The child is like, "What
are you talking about?"

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Because at that moment,
it's no longer a broom.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.530 align:middle line:84%
In the imagination
of that child,

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
it is now actually a horse.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So theta is the
first experiences

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of the child responding to
the external environment.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.495 align:middle line:10%
After age seven, the child
ramps up its brain activity

00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:10%
to the next higher
level, called alpha.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:10%
And alpha is calm consciousness.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:10%
So now, the child becomes
conscious of the world

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:10%
around it.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And by age 12,
the brain activity

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:84%
ramps up again to the
next higher level,

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
called beta, which is schoolroom
focused consciousness.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:10%
This is why there are different
educational paradigms after age

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:10%
12, because a child is
more capable of dealing

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:10%
with higher consciousness.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can look at this chart
of the evolution of the states

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of the brain from delta,
theta, alpha, and beta,

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and, well, we recognize
a very important fact.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:84%
The first seven years
of a child's life,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not expressing
consciousness.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Theta is below consciousness.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, there's another
very important characteristic

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:10%
of theta.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is theta as
a state of hypnosis.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what's the relevance?

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
How many rules do you
think a child must

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
learn to become a
functional member

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:90%
of a family in a community?

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of rules of behavior.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to give you an
idea, think about it this way.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
When a father talks to his own
child, he talks in one way.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
When a father talks
to a neighbor's child,

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
he talks in a different way.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And how he talks
to the mother is

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
totally different than how he
speaks with a neighbor, which

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is then totally different
than the father would

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.528 align:middle line:90%
talk with a policeman.

00:23:59.528 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you start to see

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that each situation in the
world requires somewhat

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:90%
of a different behavior.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
How is a child supposed
to learn thousands

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.010 align:middle line:90%
of different codes of behavior?

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
profoundly simple,

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:84%
because nature has created the
first seven years of that child

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to be in a state
of theta hypnosis.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
All the child has to do is
observe the mother, the father,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:90%
the family, the community.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And what's the child
doing during theta?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Downloading hypnotically
the behaviors.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about this, then,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:84%
is the primal programs that go
into a child's nervous system

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.010 align:middle line:84%
are not coming from the wishes
and desires of the child.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They're actually directly
downloaded from observing

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
the family and the community--

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:84%
very significant, because those
behaviors may not necessarily

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
support the wishes and desires
of that child when it grows up.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
There's another factor
in this time period

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
that's very critical.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the experience of
what is called self-identity.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:90%
A child may ask, "Who am I?"

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The answer, actually, is
not coming from the child.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from the
parents and the community

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and the teachers, who actually
tell the child, "Oh, you're

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the smartest, most loving,
beautiful child that's

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.225 align:middle line:90%
ever been on this planet."

00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that will be
downloaded and become

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:90%
part of self-identity.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
However, that's a
very rare input.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Most children are
criticized by their parents.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
You say, "Criticized?

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:90%
For what?"

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about it this way.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.690 align:middle line:84%
If there's a player on a team,
and player isn't performing

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
well, the coach doesn't
come up and go, "Oh, it

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
would be so nice of
you to do better."

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
No, the coach comes
up and says, "Come on,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.700 align:middle line:90%
you can do better than that.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:90%
That's not good enough.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.885 align:middle line:84%
You don't deserve
to be on this team."

00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the coach is
saying that to do what?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
To actually needle the player
into going, "OK, coach, I'll

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
do better," because an older
child with consciousness

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:84%
can understand exactly why
the coach is saying that.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But then I go, well, what
if parents act as coaches?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
here's the problem.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
If the child is under seven,
the child's not conscious.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not understanding
the meaning of everything.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:90%
It's in a state of record.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:90%
It's in a state of theta.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just downloading the words.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So parents are trying
to act like a coach

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
to improve the character or
the behavior of their children.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
A child is taking
all those words

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
exactly as they were
spoken and downloading them

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
into the subconscious mind.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious
minds are loaded

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
with critical assessments
of ourselves, so much so

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that we actually have a very
difficult time in loving

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:90%
I say, why?

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because our
subconscious programs

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:84%
can tell you every reason why
you should criticize yourself--

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
not good enough, not smart
enough, not loving enough,

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah,
over and over again.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And I go, oh my God, our
subconscious programs

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:84%
are so self-critical
that, in our mind,

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
we will use those and
criticize ourselves.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:84%
This is very disempowering,
because then, all of a sudden,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:84%
we are not really loving
ourselves anymore.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We're super critical
of ourselves.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And this, unfortunately,
leads to some very bad

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:90%
behavioral consequences.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So first seven years
of a child's life,

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
download programs,
no consciousness

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
involved, but necessary
for enculturation

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and self-identity.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But then, after a
seven, consciousness

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
kicks in, alpha consciousness,
creative consciousness.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a really
wonderful part of our lives,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
where we start to behave
and become very creative

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:84%
with our consciousness and then
even evolve into the higher

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
level from theta
to beta and have

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:84%
much more complex
understandings of who we are

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and how we fit into
the world around us.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, now, there's a problem.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And this problem is so profound.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
It affects all of us.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And the problem is simply this.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind
can drive our body

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:84%
like a-- consider
a body a vehicle,

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious mind's
got its hands on the wheel.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So when the conscious mind
is driving the vehicle,

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
we're moving towards
the destinations

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:90%
that we want in our life.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Conscious mind can also think.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I go, so?

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I say, thinking is
an internal job.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, wherever a
thought is, it's on the inside.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not on the outside.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
If I ask you a simple
question right now--

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.065 align:middle line:84%
tell me what you're
doing on Sunday--

00:28:37.065 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I say, where are
you going to get

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:90%
the answer for that question?

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go inside.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I say, wait a minute.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
If the conscious mind is going
inside to seek an answer, then,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:84%
by definition, it is no
longer driving the vehicle,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
paying attention.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh my gosh, then
every time we're in thought,

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind
lets go of the wheel,

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious
mind goes inside.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, science has revealed
that the average person is in

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:90%
thought 95% of the day.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
If our conscious mind is
in thought 95% of the day

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and not paying attention, then
what's controlling our biology?

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
That becomes the job
of the subconscious

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
mind, 'cause the subconscious
mind is autopilot.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And what's the problem?

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind is
not going to drive you

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:90%
toward wishes and desires.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind's
got programs in it

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that you downloaded
from other people.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting fact--
science has recognized up

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to 70% of the downloaded
programs in our subconscious

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:90%
mind--

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
guess what-- are negative
and disempowering programs.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.790 align:middle line:10%
We're only operating our
life 5% of the time seeking

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.620 align:middle line:10%
wishes and desires.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:10%
95% of our life is actually
coming from the programs

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:10%
in the subconscious,
because we're in thought.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:10%
And most of those programs are
negative and disempowering.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:10%
And I say, then,
what's the consequence?

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You are not leading the
life you wish and desire.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:84%
You're leading the
life of a program

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:84%
that you got in the
first seven years.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, recognizing
that most of these

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
are negative and
disempowering, then we

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
start to see that our
life becomes a struggle.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we don't actually
see that we're involved.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
All we see is the result of
our subconscious mind taking

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:84%
control, because our life is
not working out the way we want.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.557 align:middle line:90%
Reason?

00:30:39.557 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the programs from the
subconscious aren't yours.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They came from other people
with their own problems.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we have
a very important insight here.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And the insight is this.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Are you creating the
life that you want?

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Are you creating the life
you've been programmed with?

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the idea of this
programming is not new.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:10%
For 400 years, the Jesuits
have had a very famous saying.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:10%
"Give me a child for
the first seven years,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:10%
and I'll give you the
man," St. Francis Xavier.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:10%
The Jesuits already
knew, whatever program

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:10%
went in the first
seven years, when

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:10%
you're in a state of
theta, 95% of your life

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:10%
is going to come
from that program.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you can control the first
seven years of a child's life,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:84%
you ultimately control the
rest of that child's life,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
because 95% of
that life is going

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to come from the programs
downloaded during that period.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.797 align:middle line:84%
This is profoundly
important for this reason.

00:31:38.797 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:90%
We wake up in the morning.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.422 align:middle line:90%
We have wishes and desires.

00:31:41.422 --> 00:31:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh, today, I'm
going to be healthy.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.547 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm going to
find a relationship.

00:31:44.547 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, today, I'm going to get
that job I always wanted.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we go out
into the world.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we struggle, and then
we come home at night, beaten.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So they look at
themselves as victims.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm a victim of the world.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I wanted this.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not me that
caused the problem.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one with
the good wishes.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a story
that I've relayed

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:90%
to audiences for 30 years.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, in your history,
you had a friend,

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.455 align:middle line:84%
and you were very
close to your friend,

00:32:19.455 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and you knew your friend's
behavior very well.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And you also knew
your friend's parent.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And one day, you see your friend
expressing the same behavior

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:90%
as their parent.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, it excites you.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.698 align:middle line:90%
You want to tell your friend.

00:32:31.698 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You go, "Hey, Bill, you're
just like your dad."

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Back away from Bill.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Bill's going to go ballistic.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:84%
"How can you compare
me to my dad?

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm nothing like my dad."

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Most people laugh when they
hear this, because they've

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:90%
had that experience.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.437 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you, this is

00:32:46.437 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the most profound,
important stories I

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:90%
can tell you, for what reason?

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else can see that
Bill behaves like his dad.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The only one who
doesn't see it is Bill.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I say, but why
can't Bill see it?

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Where's his observing conscious
mind during this time?

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It's inside thinking.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So Bill does not even see the
behavior that is coming out.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, hey,
if 70% of those programs

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
are disempowering
and self-sabotaging,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can't see the behavior,
what is the consequence?

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance is
really, really critical,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:90%
because all of us are Bill.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
natural way of life.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So what does this information
mean for us as adults?

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the new
insights on childhood

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:84%
developmental
programming, we are then

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
enabled to move from our
perception of being victims

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to that of becoming masters
in programming the character

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And by reprogramming
a subconscious mind,

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:53.820 align:middle line:84%
we can manifest a
heaven-on-earth experience.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on inner evolution

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:90%
through biological change.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Join me for the
next episode, where

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:84%
we talk about heaven
on earth and taking

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:90%
the proverbial red pill.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:90%
