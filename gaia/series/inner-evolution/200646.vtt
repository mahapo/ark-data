How do three pounds of microbes
provide for our survival?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:10%
The microbiome represents a
community of microorganisms,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:10%
including bacteria
and fungi, that

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:10%
line the surfaces of
the skin and every organ

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:10%
system connected to the
external environment.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Those systems, for example,
include the digestive tract,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the respiratory tract,
the urogenital tract.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.863 align:middle line:84%
All of these are connected
to the outside environment.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
All of those
structures are coated

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
by a layer of microbes that
constitute the microbiome.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
While the human
body is comprised

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of about 50 trillion
human cells,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
the microbiome community
has from 5 to 10

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
times more microbial cells than
human cells in our population.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
A hundred-pound human carries
approximately three pounds

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
of microbes on their
body at any time.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:10%
The microbiome is so
vital for our survival,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:10%
it has been included in
the current definition

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:10%
of a human being, which is now
described as a super organism.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Supporting the vitality
of the microbiome

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental for
sustaining our health.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's dive deeper
into the microbiome.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:10%
We must first understand that
the microbiome, comprised

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:10%
of bacteria and fungi, cover
every surface of the body that

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:10%
is connected to the
external environment.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the skin is obvious,
but the respiratory, digestive,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and urogenital system
are also connected

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:90%
to the exterior environment.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
systems have a layer

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of microbes on their surface.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:10%
We acquire the
microbiome after birth.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:10%
Recognizing this important fact,
while a fetus is in the womb,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:10%
that's a very
sterile environment.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:10%
However, when the water
breaks and the baby

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:10%
is beginning to
be born, the baby

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:10%
passes through the uterus
and the vaginal surfaces,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:10%
which are lined by the
mother's microbiome.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:10%
At this point,
the newborn infant

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:10%
is already being
inoculated with cells that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:10%
will constitute its microbiome.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
In addition, as that newborn
starts to wean itself

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and breastfeed, guess what.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:10%
It also picks up the
microbiome components

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:10%
of the mother's skin,
and it's inoculated

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:10%
onto the skin of the newborn.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome is picked
up immediately after birth

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and is added to as a
child begins to develop.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:90%
So what is the microbiome doing?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's a community--

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:10%
a harmonious community of
bacteria and fungi that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:10%
are working together and
forming a layer on the surface.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
As we move through the
world, we encounter all kinds

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of pathogens in the
environment that

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:90%
touch the surface of our body.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Significance is we
anticipate that of course

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
our immune system will manage
these invasive organisms.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But here's a very
important fact.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of these
pathogenic organisms

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
are actually dealt with
not by our immune system,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
but by the microbiome.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because as pathogens enter into
that layer of the microbiome,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
the cells in the community
of the microbiome

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
will do every effort
they can come up with

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of invasive
organisms that will upset

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the community.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:10%
So even before germs
can touch your body,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:10%
your microbiome has filtered
out almost all of the pathogens

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:10%
at this point.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:10%
The microbiome is therefore the
first deterrent to infection.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So primary consequence
of microbiome-- support

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%
of the immune system.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
But guess what.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:10%
There's another major
important contribution

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:10%
that the microbiome
offers to our survival,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.738 align:middle line:10%
and it has to do with supporting
our digestion processes.

00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
We've always been led to
believe that when you eat food

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and it enters in the
stomach, that acid will

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
begin to break down
the food into smaller

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and smaller particles.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And as the food moves from
the stomach into the small

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:10%
intestine, enzymes in the small
intestine-- digestive enzymes--

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:10%
will further break down the
food into smaller and smaller

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:10%
pieces.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
However, between
the acid in the gut

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and the enzymes in
the small intestine,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
this does not break down the
food into the building blocks

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:90%
that the body can absorb.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It is up to the
microbiome in the gut

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to do the final
process of digestion,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
breaking the smallest
pieces of food

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
down into the building blocks
that we can absorb in our gut

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and use in our body to fulfill
the building and maintenance

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
of our physiology.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So the microbiome is a necessary
component of digestion,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and the gut bacteria are the
last stage of this digestion

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
A third function of
microbiome organisms

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is that they
exchange information

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
between their community
and our community

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
of our own human cells.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:10%
So microbiome sends
signals to our cells,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:10%
which adjust our genetics.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So our gut cells, the
genes that are active,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by the
secretion of the microbiome.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In addition, our gut
cells make secretions

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that influence the
fate and development

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:90%
of our microbiome population.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
important part.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
We cannot digest food
without a microbiome.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:84%
A problem that we encounter
almost on a daily basis

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is the overuse of antibiotics.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics, of course,
were put into a system

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate
pathogenic bacteria.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:90%
But the issue is this.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics do not necessarily
distinguish between pathogens

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and the normal
microbiome cells that we

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:90%
require for our own survival.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when we use
antibiotics, we generally

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:90%
wipe out our own microbiome.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:10%
The same thing occurs,
actually, if we

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:10%
do get a pathogenic bacterium
that gets into the system,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:10%
destroys the microbiome,
and we experience something

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:10%
such as diarrhea,
which is the cleansing

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:10%
of the entire digestive tract,
wiping out all of the bacteria.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem is now,
oh my goodness, we just

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
lost the bacteria, either
through antibiotics or invasive

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:90%
organisms.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you think we should do?

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
very important.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:10%
We should start to use
probiotics and prebiotics,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:10%
things such as yogurt,
or fermented foods

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:10%
such as sauerkraut.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.880 align:middle line:84%
These agent support the
growth and maintenance

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:90%
of our microbiome.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:10%
So after a series of
antibiotics or after a diarrhea,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:10%
it's very important to
rebuild our microbiome.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, an interesting
aspect of this

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:84%
is, where do we get our new
microbiome cells to replace

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:90%
the ones that just got lost?

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, guess what.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:84%
We find out there is a
use for the appendix,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
once thought to be
a vestigial organ,

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
meaning an organ that
no longer is used by us.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
The appendix is the equivalent
of a safety deposit box

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that store samples of our
normal microbiome species.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And so after a rush of
antibiotics or diarrhea

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
eliminates our normal
microbiome in the gut,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria that are
present in our appendix

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
are released and reseed
that microbiome to allow

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:90%
us to continue our survival.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And now there's also a new
insight to the gut microbiome,

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and that is this.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome
cells, the bacteria

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and the fungi in
our gut, release

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
hormones of the same type that
we use in our own biology.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Hormones such as
serotonin or dopamine,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:10%
or stress hormones like
norepinephrine and cortisol,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:10%
are also manufactured and
secreted by the microbiome.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:10%
These hormones are also then
picked up by our biology.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard of
something called gut feelings.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the microbiome
releasing these hormones

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
influence our own
system, so we actually

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
get an expression or
experience of the activity

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:90%
of these microbiome.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect we
also have recently

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
understood about
the microbiome is

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
they release two very
important hormones

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:90%
that control our appetite--

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:90%
leptin and ghrelin.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
These hormones actually
control our feeding behavior.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the bacteria
release leptin,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
it sends a signal saying
we've had enough food,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and then we lose our appetite.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:10%
But if the microbiome
cells release ghrelin,

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:10%
that actually causes us to eat
more because the microbiome is

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:10%
really calling on us to put
more food into the system

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:10%
to support the microbiome.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And then our appetite increases.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting,
because many people want

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
to lose weight,
consciously thinking,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.972 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to control my appetite
by using my consciousness.

00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out, guess what.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It's undermined by the
release of leptin and ghrelin

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:90%
by our own microbiome.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So actually, we have to
deal with the activity

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
of the microbiome because
it's primary in controlling

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:90%
our appetite.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, it's
really important

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that the microbiome
is an important component

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of our human biology.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Three primary functions.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
A, it helps us
with our digestion

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
so we can use our
food and metabolites.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:90%
B, it's an endocrine system.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It actually releases
hormones that

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
influence not just their
behavior, but our behavior,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:84%
hence the concept
of gut feelings.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And C, one of the most
important aspects,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
is that our immune
system is enhanced

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
by the activity of
the microbiome that

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
will kill invasive pathogens
even before they touch

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
the body's surface itself.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So science has now
included the microbiome

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
as part of a
healthy human being.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've mentioned
the immune system here,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is really
a very important time

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to talk about another
aspect of the immune system

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that most people are
really not familiar with.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And that aspect is actually
talking about lymph.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
What is lymph?

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It is vital to our
understanding of the nature

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of how we stay alive and
how our immune system can

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:90%
keep us healthy.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's first start with,
where does lymph come from?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
It comes from blood.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.232 align:middle line:84%
I say, so what's
blood made out of?

00:10:55.232 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's made out of cells.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, red blood cells
and white blood cells

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
we're all familiar
with, but these cells

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
are dissolved in a
fluid called plasma.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what's
in the plasma?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, the building
blocks that have just

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
been absorbed from the gut
are part of the plasma.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance of that
is that then the blood,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
as it's moving through the body,
will distribute the building

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
blocks to the cells so they
can maintain their function.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
The plasma also contains
regulatory chemicals,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
such as hormones and
emotional chemicals that

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
influence our life, and the
blood will distribute this

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, how do the elements
of the blood get into the body

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:90%
itself?

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Because blood is in a
series of walled vessels,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
so blood is contained in
arteries, capillaries,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
and veinules.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
How does the nutrition
come from the blood vessel

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
to get into the tissue?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
this, consider this.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:10%
A blood vessel is
lined by a layer

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:10%
of cells that resemble tiles.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
These are cells that are
called endothelial cells.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They're like little flat tiles
that come against each other

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:90%
with a small space between them.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the point.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Arteries are larger
vessels carrying

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
a very large volume of blood.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But when an artery breaks
down into capillaries,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the capillaries are very small
bore, very small diameter.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what's
the consequence?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to push a lot
of blood through the artery

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and into the
capillary, you can't

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:84%
get all of that blood to
fit into the capillary

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:90%
without pressure.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is where blood
pressure comes from.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I say, so what?

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, as the
pressure increases,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
it forces the fluid
in the blood to slip

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
between the spaces of
the endothelial cells,

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.597 align:middle line:84%
those little spaces
between the tiles.

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And I say, well, what comes out?

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I say, fluid comes
out, salt comes out,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the building blocks
of nutrients come out.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:90%
What about the cells?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:90%
No, the cells can't come out.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So the red cells never
leave the blood vessel.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The white cells at this point
don't leave the blood vessels,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that gets out of
a blood vessel in the capillary

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:90%
is the fluid.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Now we call the leakage "lymph."

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I say, so now the
capillary leaks.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, so where
is this leakage going?

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the blood fluid
leaks out of the vessel,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
it enters into what is
called connective tissue.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Connective tissue is like a
spongy connective material

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that lies between the blood
vessels and the functional

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:90%
cells of the organs in the body.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the significance is fluid
comes out of the blood vessel,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
moves through the
spongy material,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and goes toward the cells
to nourish the cells

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and take care of them.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means then
the blood is losing

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%
fluid at the capillary end.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the capillary,
the vessels get larger again

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:90%
and they form the veins.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, just as the capillary
is ending, a lot of fluid

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is sucked back into the
blood vessel because

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
of a process called osmosis.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Osmosis just means there's
a pressure causing fluid

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
from the outside to come
back in to the vessel.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning
of the capillary,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
pressure causes the
fluid to leak out.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
capillary, osmosis

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
causes the fluid
to come back in.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%
But there's a problem.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Not all the fluid can
be returned this way.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There's excess fluid in
the connective tissue.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what are you
going to do with this fluid?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to get
it back to the blood,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we compromise
the circulatory system.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting
aspect is this.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
There are drains in
the connective tissue--

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
open drains that lead to a
system of its own capillaries

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:90%
called lymphatics.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Once the plasma leaks
out of the capillary,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.228 align:middle line:90%
now we call the leakage lymph.

00:14:53.228 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, so what's
the function of lymph?

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Well it's carrying nutrients
and information to the cells

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
and supporting their
vitality, the cells especially

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:90%
of the organs.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I said, OK, most of the
lymph gets pulled back in,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:90%
but not all of it.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
An excess lymph then
has to be returned.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And how it's returned is the
open vessels of lymphatics

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:90%
are like drains in a sink.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So a matter of fact, using a
sink is a very good analogy.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
When you turn on the water,
the pressure of the water

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
forces the fluid
out of the nozzle,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and now you fill up the sink.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Gravity will pull the fluid and
cause it to go down the drain.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The lymphatics are
analogous to the drain.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So when excess
fluid is coming out

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
of the vessel that
can't go back in,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that fluid is going
down the drain, which

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:90%
are the lymphatic vessels.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The lymphatic vessels are
a whole network of vessels

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and go back to the heart.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
There's something
called a thoracic duct.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Right at the heart, the lymph
is returned back to the blood

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So all fluid, ultimately
it comes back in the blood.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
There are filters inside
the lymphatic tract

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that before the lymph is
returned to the blood vessel,

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
these filters remove the waste
products that were picked up

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
by the lymph as it passed
through the connective tissue.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And in these lymph
nodes are immune cells

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that will actually
recognize if there

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
are contaminants or pathogens
that have to be removed.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
These immune cells will clear
the lymph of these pathogens

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:90%
before the lymph is returned.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So lymph nodes are
simply inline filters

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that clean the lymph before
that fluid is returned back

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
to the blood.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a very important
system, the lymphatic system.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I go back to
the story of a sink,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:10%
I said there's pressure pushing
the water out of the faucet,

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:10%
but gravity is what brings
it into the lymphatics.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:10%
There is no heart to
the lymphatic system.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:10%
It only works by gravity.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:10%
So think about it this way.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:10%
Any lymphatic vessels
in your head, gravity

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:10%
will drain those
lymphatic vessels down

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
through the lymph nodes,
filter it, and then

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:10%
take it to the thoracic
duct and return it back

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:10%
to the blood at the heart.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:90%
But there's an issue.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
What about lymph
that's below the heart?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, gravity
is controlling the flow.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what you would anticipate
is, oh my goodness, any lymph

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
below the heart, by gravity
would then settle down,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:90%
go to our feet.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, then how do
you get the lymph back?

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
very important,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
because the lymphatic vessels,
the lymphatic capillaries

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:90%
run between the muscles.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you
exercise the muscles,

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
you cause them to contract,
squeeze the muscles.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And the muscles, then
when they contract,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:90%
they squeeze the lymphatic.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like a peristalsis,
a movement of pressure

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
by muscle that pushes
the lymph back up.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And as the lymph is
being pushed back up,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
there are valves in
the lymphatic that

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:90%
open up to let the lymph go up.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:10%
But when the pressure
relaxes for a second,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:10%
the valves close, so the
lymph can't go back down.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Point.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Below the neck, the
fluid that's released

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%
by the blood, the
lymph, now going

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
through the connective tissue,
carrying debris and pathogens

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
with it, go into the lymphatic
system, and by gravity

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
are pulled down.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Exercising your legs
and your muscles

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
causes a contraction,
a peristaltic reaction

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that squeezes the lymphatics
and pushes the blood back

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:38.548 align:middle line:90%
up to the heart.

00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:10%
You know what's
interesting-- have you ever

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:10%
looked at the guards that stand
outside Buckingham Palace,

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:10%
and they all stand perfectly
straight like this all day

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:10%
long?

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:10%
Every now and then,
you see one of them

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:10%
fall flat on their face.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:10%
I say, what was happening?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is this.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:10%
If you don't squeeze the muscles
in the legs by using them,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:10%
the lymph doesn't come back up.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:10%
And now there's a shortage
of fluid in the blood,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:10%
and the pressure changes.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, an
individual can pass out,

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the
guard will fall down.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:10%
But this is also an
important point for you.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
exercising, the lymph

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
can become stagnant and not
be returned to the vessels.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:90%
So, so far, what do we have?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We have pressure forcing
the fluid out of the blood,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
creating lymph running
through the connective tissue,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
nourishing the cells in
the surrounding area.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
as the lymph is now

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
collecting and going down
the drain, the lymphatics,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:84%
it's also picking up
pathogens and debris

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:90%
from cells, et cetera.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
so the lymph is
somewhat contaminated.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But as the lymph is going
back up to the heart,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
there are inline filters
called lymph nodes that

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
will remove the pathogens and
also engage in immune response

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
if any of those pathogens
are very active,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:90%
to fight those pathogens.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the nature of
the lymphatic system.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's an
unfortunate situation,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and that is, we have
something called tonsils.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
tonsils in the throat.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:84%
There are tonsils in
the small intestine.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And the appendix is a
third set of tonsils.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what
are tonsils for?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Well let's look at the
ones in the throat.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
There are three pairs of
tonsils, meaning six tonsils.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Two above the hard palate, the
roof of the mouth, and those

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%
are called the adenoids.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
There are two at the
back of your throat,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and these are called
the palatine tonsils.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are two more at
the base of your tongue,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
called the sublingual tonsils.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I say, so what's
the significance?

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, histologically,
when you look at a tonsil,

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it almost looks
like a lymph node.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was so close
to it that we then

00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
were led to believe that tonsils
are filtering out pathogens

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:90%
before they go down our throat.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
If we eat food or breathe in
air that have pathogens in it,

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
as it goes down
the throat, it was

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
believed that the tonsils
would act like lymph nodes

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and clear out these pathogens.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's what the
belief has always been.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:10%
And removing tonsils
has frequently

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:10%
been just a
characteristic activity.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Oh, your tonsils are inflamed,
and we must take them out.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we just look at it as
just a device for filtering.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's an
interesting point.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The tonsils in the
throat, for example,

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
are under some of the thickest
lining epithelial cells,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:90%
similar to skin.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's so thick that this would
be the least likely place

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:90%
an infection would occur.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to
use a tonsil as a filter,

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
you'd put it down
lower in the gut

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
where there's only a single
layer lining the gut cells.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So the question is this.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:10%
Why would we put tonsils
to filter out pathogens

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:10%
under the place that is
least likely to be infected

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:10%
by pathogens?

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, perhaps because
we have a misunderstanding

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:90%
of what tonsils are all about.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Tonsils are actually
connected to the lumen,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:84%
or the opening of the gut,
with little tiny channels.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Tonsils only actually examine
about 1/1,000 of the material

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:90%
that's going down the throat.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:90%
It's sampling.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:90%
I say, why is it sampling?

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the tonsil
is a learning center.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The tonsil is
learning about what's

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the environment,
and it's actually then training

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It's nature's natural
vaccination system.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So when toxic elements
come into the throat,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
1/1,000 of the amount going
down the throat goes through

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
the little channels that
enter into the tonsils.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Inside the tonsils, there are
immune cells that are actually

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
learning about these pathogens.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
When these immune cells
become activated and recognize

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:90%
the pathogen, guess what?

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:10%
They move from the tonsils
to the salivary glands.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.928 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the immune cells
are making antibodies

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
against the pathogens that have
just been discovered going down

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
the throat.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so if you move
those immune cells

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
from the tonsil to the
salivary gland, guess what?

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:10%
In that site, the immune
cells release antibodies

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:10%
into the saliva
so as now, as you

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:10%
take in stuff from the outside
environment and swallow it,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:10%
the saliva is
carrying immune cells

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:10%
to neutralize
environmental pathogens.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:90%
So tonsils are learning centers.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They're not primarily there
to clear out elements.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And as learning centers,
think about this.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Why do infants stick everything
they can into their mouths?

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Because by sticking everything
from the environment

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
into the mouth, they're
training the tonsils

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
out in the environment.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:90%
They're learning centers.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And so infants will stick
everything into their mouth.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And small part of that
goes into the tonsils.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The tonsils will identify
what's out there,

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
create an immune cell that
will deal with the pathogens,

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
put those immune cells
into the salivary glands.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So as you eat or have saliva
going into your mouth,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
it carries the antibodies
that will protect us

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
from environmental pathogens.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So the tonsils are the body's
natural vaccination mechanism.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And I say, why is
this important?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Because over a million
years of evolution

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
led to the development
of a remarkable system

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the pathogens
in the world that we live in.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
vaccinate an individual,

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:90%
you would use an oral vaccine.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I say, yeah, but what
if I take a needle

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and inject a vaccine
under the skin?

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Now you've violated the system.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:84%
The system was designed to read
when any pathogens come in.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If you take a needle and inject
the pathogens under the skin,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:90%
you bypass the sentries.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:10%
And as a result, now the cells
in the body are dealing with,

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:10%
where did that come from?

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:10%
How do we deal with this?

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:10%
You're actually confusing
the immune system

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:10%
because the system was designed
to recognize pathogens.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:10%
And if a pathogen shows up
in the middle of the body

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:10%
because a needle stuck it there,
the intelligence of the system

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:10%
has no recognition as to how
it got there, why it got there.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually
interfere with the health

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%
of that individual.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is important
for today's world

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:10%
because now there are up
to 65 different vaccines

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:10%
that infants get to protect
them from different sorts

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:10%
of diseases.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Virtually all of
these vaccines are

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:84%
injected with a syringe, which
means you're not supporting

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
the immune system that way.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You're actually causing
a confusion of it.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Another very important
fact is this.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The immune system isn't
really very mature

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:84%
until about two or
three years of age.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
how many vaccines do

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
the kids get before that age?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:10%
Over 50 vaccines.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system isn't
even fully developed yet.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, then how does
a child protect itself?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
really important.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Because as the child is
developing in the womb,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
the mother's blood is feeding
and nourishing that fetus.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But the mother's blood also
carries antibodies in it.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:90%
So relevance is this.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The fetus is being
infused with antibodies

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:84%
against the pathogens that the
mother has already recognized.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So the first part of our immune
system is actually passive.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:84%
It's received from the
mother via her blood

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the
blood of the fetus.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Secondarily, during
breastfeeding,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
the milk that is
expressed by the breast

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.760 align:middle line:84%
also contains antibodies that
were secreted into that milk

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:90%
by the mother's system.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So how is an infant
protected in the early days?

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:84%
A, passively from the antibodies
received from the mother's

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
blood during development.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And B, after birth,
additional antibodies

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:90%
are provided by breast milk.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So we've had a misunderstanding
about the immune system.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, I'm behind
vaccines, but only vaccines

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that are presented orally,
because this is nature's

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
natural mechanism, to provide
an individual with antibody

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:90%
support.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion,
microbiome functions

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
include neutralizing
infection-causing environmental

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:90%
agents.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Microbiome provides
the final digestion

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and metabolites so we can
absorb the molecular building

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:90%
blocks in our gut.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And microbiome
provide regulating

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:10%
coordinating information through
the secretion of hormones

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:10%
and neurochemicals into the gut
that we absorb into our body

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:10%
and influence our health.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I added the story of
lymphatics and tonsils

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because there's been
a misunderstanding

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of how
we actually provide

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:90%
for our own immune system.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we will include

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:84%
a discussion on the
molecular insights

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:90%
into the realm of spirituality.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:90%
