>> Though no longer
supported by science,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
the public still believes that
genes control the character

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and fate, for it was perceived
that genes turning on and off

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:90%
would control cell behavior.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.210 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to
have epigenetic control

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:90%
over your genes?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.153 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on inner evolution.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
The notion of
genetic determinism

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is a belief that human
behavior is controlled

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:90%
by an individual's genes.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Genetic traits are inherited.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And with the belief that genes
turn themselves on and off,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
the public has been led
to believe that they

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:90%
are victims of their heredity.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
By 1990, the belief
in genetic control

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
was undermined by the new
science of epigenetic control.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
The prefix "epi" means above.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, epigenetic
control translates

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:90%
as control above the genes.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, the above
represents the environment

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly our
perception of the environment.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Since we are able to
control our environment

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and our perceptions,
this knowledge

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
reveals we are actually
masters at controlling our gene

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's get deeper into the
facts about epigenetics.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, Watson and Crick
revealed to the world

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the
DNA double helix.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And based on that understanding
about genes controlling life,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Francis Crick went
further and created what

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:90%
is called the central dogma.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a conventional
belief of science

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that genes control our
biology, that information

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
flows in a uni-directional
manner from the DNA genes

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to RNA, which are the
Xerox copies of the genes,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to protein, which are the
molecules created by the gene

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:90%
blueprints.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:10%
This flow path does not allow
for the cell, or the protein

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:10%
mechanism, the body, to
alter its own genetic fate,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and so basically we are left
with an understanding called

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:10%
the primacy of DNA.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
In 1892, August Weismann,
a German scientist,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:90%
proposed the germ plasm theory.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
This theory does not
allow the life experiences

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of the body's cells to alter
the genetics of the germ

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:90%
cells, the sperm and the eggs.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The germ cells are
set aside very early

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
in human development.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Even before the child is born,
the egg cells of the woman

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
are already predetermined
to be egg cells,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
so there is a separation of
body from future germ cells.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And significance
is, then, whatever

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
happens in our body
presumably does not

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
affect the heritable traits
carried by the germ cells.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, my study
on clone stem cells

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
revealed a very
interesting insight

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
onto the nature of how
genes are controlled.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
When signals from
the growth medium

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
touch the surface
of the cell, they're

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
picked up by the
receptors of the cell.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, those signals
from the environment

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
are transmitted into the
cell, via the second part

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
of the switch, which
are channel proteins.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So information from
the environment

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is relayed across a cell
membrane, enters into the cell,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and then the signals
that enter into the cell

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
are actually complementing
the proteins in the cell.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And remember, when a
signal binds to a protein,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
it causes the protein
to change shape.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the changing of the
shape of the proteins

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that manifest the
characteristics of the cell's

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:90%
behavior.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The study of signals going from
the environment across a cell

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
membrane is part of the science
called signal transduction.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.987 align:middle line:84%
When signals go into the cell,
they can go into the nucleus.

00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And what's in the nucleus?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:90%
The chromosomes.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we must recognize
the simple fact

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that chromosomes are made out
of 50% DNA and 50% protein.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the signals
from the environment

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
can either affect
the DNA molecules

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
or they can affect the
protein molecules that

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
are forming the chromosome.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So when a signal comes
in that affects the DNA,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it affects it by
actually binding

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of
the DNA molecule,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
groups called
methyl groups, which

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
represent a carbon and
three hydrogen atoms.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
A methyl group, when
attached to a DNA molecule,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
can generally inhibit the
activity of that DNA blueprint,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
so DNA blueprint
activity is now being

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
controlled by the signals
coming from the environment.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
of this is that, why

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
should we inhibit
the activity of genes

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
using environmental signals?

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
really important

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:90%
because it represents this.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:10%
In the genome, we have
two copies of every gene--

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:10%
one received from the mother and
one received from the father.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:10%
Outside of the function
of the immune system,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:10%
almost all other
activities of the cell

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:10%
are predicated on the activity
of only one of the genes.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
However, during the
developmental process,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
epigenetic mechanisms will
silence one of the genes

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
so either the mother or
the father's character

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to be expressed
in that individual.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
To give you an analogy of
what a chromosome is like,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll use my arm.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:90%
My arm is a chromosome.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
My sleeve is a protein
cover over the DNA.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA forms the
core of a chromosome,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and a protein sleeve
covers up that DNA.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And so in epigenetic
mechanisms, I

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
can affect either
the core DNA or I

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
can influence the
proteins that comprise

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:90%
the sleeve of the chromosome.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about what
happens when epigenetics

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:90%
directly affects the DNA.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:10%
So in my animation, what
we see as a chromosome

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:10%
with a core of DNA.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:10%
And the outer sheath of
proteins contain what

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:10%
are called regulatory proteins.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:10%
These proteins, as
the name implies,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:10%
regulates the activity
of reading the genes.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
When signals from
the environment

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
pass through the cytoplasm
and enter into the nucleus,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
they can either
affect the DNA core,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or the signal from
the environment

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
can alter the
proteins comprising

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the sheath or the sleeve
of the chromosome.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Relevance?

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:10%
As illustrated in this
picture, when the signal binds

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:10%
to a chromosomal protein, it
causes that chromosomal protein

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:10%
to change shape.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And when that shape
change occurs,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
it causes the sleeve of the
chromosome, the protein sleeve,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
to come off, and this exposes
the DNA blueprint underneath.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a core of DNA
and a sleeve a protein.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
To give you a simple
example is this.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's my chromosome.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Underneath are my genes.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
If I would take a magic marker
and write the genetic code

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.758 align:middle line:84%
for blue eyes, so you could
read the genetic code,

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I say, what does it look like
when it's in the nucleus?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh, it looks like this.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.845 align:middle line:84%
I say, can you read
the gene for blue eyes?

00:07:54.845 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But to read that gene for
blue eyes, what must you do?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You must cause the
sleeve to come off.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when a signal binds
to a regulatory protein,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
it causes the
sleeve to be removed

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
exposing the DNA blueprint,
the gene, for blue eyes.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the mechanism of
how a gene is regulated,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's illustrated in
this animation, where

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the environmental signal
binds to a regulatory protein,

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
the sleeve pops off
and exposes the DNA.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
part is this.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that the DNA is exposed,
what is the next action?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, remember
the central dogma?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
DNA goes to RNA, and
that goes to protein.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:10%
Well, once the DNA is exposed,
the original blueprint,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:10%
a protein called an RNA
polymerase binds to the exposed

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:10%
DNA, the gene, and as it moves
down the length of the gene,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.115 align:middle line:10%
it makes a copy of that gene,
but not DNA, an RNA version.

00:08:57.115 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have a copy
of the gene, the RNA,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that's what goes out into
the cell, into the cytoplasm,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and the RNA copy
is actually used

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to create the protein, which is
made by reading that RNA copy.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:90%
So then what happens?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let's review.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The signal comes in, binds
to a regulatory protein,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
causes the sleeve to pop
off, exposes the DNA.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, an enzyme, RNA polymerase,
comes up, copies the gene.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The RNA goes out into the
cytoplasm where it is then

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:90%
used to synthesize the protein.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And what about the gene?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sleeve
covers it back up again

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
when the signal is gone,
and now the gene is hidden.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And the point is simply this.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
For 50 years, we've
talked about DNA

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
controlling its own
activity, but the DNA

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:90%
had no control at all.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The control came
from the proteins.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
When the protein sleeve was
on, can't read the gene.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
When a signal causes
a protein to come off,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:90%
it exposes the gene.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Then what does the gene do?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, nothing.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:90%
The gene is just a blueprint.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the enzyme,
the RNA polymerase,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that makes a copy
of the blueprint,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and that copy, called RNA,
goes out into the cell

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
so I can manufacture the
protein by that gene.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Once the RNA copy is created,
we don't need the gene anymore.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The signal pops off
the protein sleeve,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
the sleeve covers
up the gene, and now

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
it's quiescent,
not doing anything.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We can now look at
a strand of DNA,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and what we'll see
in that strand of DNA

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
is very simply this.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's epigenetics, the
mechanism of epigenetics,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that is actually
controlling gene behavior.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The genes have nothing
to do with this at all,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
they're just
templates to be read.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics represents the
environmental signal coming in.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:10%
The environmental signal
can alter the DNA blueprint.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:10%
The environmental
signal can come in

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:10%
and engage with a
protein and then regulate

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:10%
the activity of the gene
that is now exposed.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics has two
different actions--

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
on the DNA directly
or on the proteins.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the important aspects
of how epigenetics controls

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
the readout of the genes
deals with the ability

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to affect the proteins that
are controlling gene activity.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, to illustrate
that, I'm going

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to show you a picture
here of a television set

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:90%
with a test pattern on it.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, the
station sent a test pattern

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that could be viewed
on your television set.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:90%
So a test pattern is a pattern.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's make it
analogous to a gene.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
important about this is you

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
can adjust the dials on the
television set which will

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
influence that test pattern.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:90%
On and off, first of all.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Is the pattern on or
is the pattern off?

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I can change the volume.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.490 align:middle line:90%
How much of this do I want?

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:90%
How little of it do I want?

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I can change some
other dials and change

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the focus, the contrast,
the color balance.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I can change the
width and the height.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I can keep altering
the test pattern.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The test pattern is
the original gene.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And by changing the dials
on the television set,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
am I actually changing the
actual test pattern itself

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
or am I changing the
readout of the test pattern?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics does not
alter the gene itself.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics actually alters
the readout of the gene.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So I can change the
readout, but I've never

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:90%
changed the original gene.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
As a result, I can create
over 3,000 different proteins

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
from the very same
gene blueprint

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
without altering the gene.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
This is an important point
that I must emphasize.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics does not
change the gene proper.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics only changes
the readout of the gene.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate that, I want
to show you a stretch of DNA.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The loop in my
stretch right here

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
actually represents
a gene, let's say

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
the gene for blue eyes.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The genes only constitute
about 3% of the total DNA.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
That means 97% of the DNA in
your nucleus, in your genome,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:90%
does not code for any protein.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It was referred to
incorrectly as junk DNA,

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
for it was once believed
that this extra 97% of DNA

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
was just DNA carried from
generation for generation

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
for a million
years, and our cells

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
end up with a lot of pieces of
DNA that are no longer used,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:90%
hence junk DNA.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is completely
a misunderstanding

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of the whole importance of
this extra non-gene DNA.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Significance is this.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Along the stretches of that DNA
that is not coding as a gene,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
there are protein modules,
groups of proteins,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that are scattered along
the DNA in front of the gene

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as some modules
behind the gene.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
The modules of protein
scattered on the DNA

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
are the equivalent of the
dials on the television set.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:10%
By adjusting the
modules, you can

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:10%
adjust which genes are going to
turn on, how much of that gene

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:10%
you're going to use,
and you can adjust

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:10%
the character of the gene.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:10%
So by turning the
so-called dials

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:10%
on these protein
modules, what you do

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:10%
is affect the
readout of the gene.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:10%
And through this
process, you can actually

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:10%
cause over 3,000 different
versions of the blueprint

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:10%
to be read from a single
gene, and not altering a gene,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:10%
just altering the
readout of this gene.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The important point here is,
how can a single gene blueprint

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
provide for over 3,000
different proteins?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
connected to something called

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
epigenetic gene splicing.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when the DNA molecule
is exposed in the chromosome,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we make a copy of
that DNA molecule.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:90%
It's called messenger RNA.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
That messenger RNA
molecule goes out

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
into the cytoplasm
where a mechanism will

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
read that messenger and
then turn it into a protein.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's a very important
part about the messenger RNA.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:10%
It contains a series
of information

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:10%
that is the building
blocks to make a protein.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So analogy that would
be very important

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is, consider writing
a piece of text

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:90%
on a linear piece of paper.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I start with a copy of what
we'll call the "reading" gene.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And the messenger RNA is a strip
with the word "reading" written

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:10%
across the strip.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I say, and what
does epigenetics do?

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like a pair of
scissors and tape.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
You can cut that
message into pieces

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and reassemble it using tape
in a different sequence.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I
can cut off the "ing"

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and I end up with "read" gene.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Or I could get rid of
the R-E-A, and I'll

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
be left with the "ding" gene.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:10%
Or I could cut the
beginning and the end

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:10%
off and be left with what
is called the "ad" gene.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:10%
Or I could cut the middle
out and join the two ends

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and make the "ring" gene.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at five different
readings of the same gene

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
by just cutting up
the messenger RNA.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you understand
messenger RNA may

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:84%
have thousands of letters, then
all of a sudden you can say,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, then I could
cut that messenger RNA up

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
into thousands of parts
and put them together,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is how I can create
over 3,000 different proteins

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:90%
from the very same gene.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
You are not restricted to
exactly what the gene says.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You can alter the
readout of the gene.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I say, and what alters
the readout of the gene?

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Epigenetics.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
Environmental signals,
picked up by the individual,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
sent through the
cells into the nucleus

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
where it changes the
so-called modules or dials

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
on that DNA to alter the final
readout of a gene blueprint.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
are not restricted

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
to whatever a gene message
is that you inherited

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:90%
because you can alter any gene.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, here's a problem.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Most of us came with a
completely healthy, normal set

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:90%
of genes for a good life.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
When we alter these
genes by epigenetics,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
the greater probability
is we'll actually

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
create a dysfunctional
protein rather than improving

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:90%
the ones we inherited.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet, on the other hand,
think about it this way.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
You could come
with a mutant gene,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and through epigenetic
alterations of the readout,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
turn it into a very
healthy, active gene.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
we have to understand

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:90%
the most important part.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
You are not your genes.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:10%
You can change the
readout of the genes.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:10%
How do you change it?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:84%
By responding to
the environment.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And as we'll talk about
later, more importantly,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
how your perception can alter
the environmental signals

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and in turn alter
your genetic readout.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So simply, the concept
of genetic determinism,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
you are your genes, is
a false understanding

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately
misleads people

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
to believe that perhaps they've
inherited a defective gene.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, in their
consciousness, they

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
can anticipate that, oh,
I'm going to get cancer

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to get
cardiovascular disease

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
because that's
running in my family.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, an example of
where a mutant gene

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
could be read as a normal gene
is in this picture of two mice.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The mouse on the
left is obviously

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
different than the
normal-looking mouse

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:90%
on the right.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:10%
The mouse on the left
is expressing what

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:10%
is called an agouti mutation.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:10%
An agouti mutant, obviously
one thing you could see,

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:10%
is very obese compared
to a normal mouse.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:10%
It also has different
colored fur.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:10%
It also has diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:10%
The agouti mutant
is a mouse that

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:10%
has a very short lifespan
because of the mutant agouti

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:10%
gene that it carries.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mouse on
the right is the one

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a
normal mouse, but here's

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.622 align:middle line:84%
the interesting sidelight,
and that is this.

00:19:30.622 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:10%
This mouse also carries
the mutant agouti gene,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:10%
but it looks normal.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, how can that be?

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
very interesting

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
because, during the development
of this mouse while it

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
was in utero, the mother, at a
very specific window in time,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:84%
was given a diet that included
some elements such as vitamin

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:84%
B12, choline, folic
acid, and these elements

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:90%
affect the epigenetic readout.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So when giving the
mother this as part

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
of her diet during a certain
part of the development

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of the mouse, these
elements in her diet

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
went across the
placenta and altered

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
the readout of the genes
in the developing fetus.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:10%
And what it did, it had
covered up the mutant gene

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:10%
for the agouti mutation.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Relevance?

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
This mouse has a normal
life, completely healthy.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
But the important point is this.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It still has the
mutant agouti gene,

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
so if it mates
with another mouse,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:84%
it will pass that intact mutant
gene onto the next generation.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:10%
So the significance is, even
though the mouse is endowed

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:10%
with the mutant gene,
through epigenetic mechanism,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:10%
it has covered up
that particular gene

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:10%
and not expressing it.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, a similar
understanding can come

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:90%
from studying identical twins.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The moment identical twins
are born, recognize this.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Both twins came from a single
egg cell that split into two.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Relevance?

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Both twins have
exactly the same genes.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment of birth, if
you do a genetic assessment

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
of both twins, the
genes in either sibling

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
as in the other one.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But then, if you come back a
year later, five years later,

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, and read the
genetic readout from each

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of the siblings, guess what?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:90%
They diverge over time.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
what were identical twins

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
are no longer identical in
their experience and expression

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
of their life.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So in one sense,
one of the twins

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
can end up dying of
cancer and the other one

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
have a healthy, normal
life, and yet, they

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:90%
were genetically identical.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, where
did the cancer come from?

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't built into the genes.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The cancer was a consequence
of epigenetic alterations

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic profile
of that individual.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So two identical twins
start out exactly the same.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But by experiencing life, and
each individually experiencing

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:84%
their own expression of life,
alters their genetic readout,

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
they're no longer expressing
an identical characteristic.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Insight into the effect of
environment on your genes

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
is revealed in a very
interesting study

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
by Dean Ornish, an internist
in San Francisco, California.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
What Dean was working with
was a group of prostate cancer

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
patients, and he did this
very simple experiment

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
with very profound results.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
He separated his prostate
cancer patients into two groups.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
One group was given the
conventional treatment

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that prostate
cancer patients get,

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
including chemotherapy and
drugs to hold back the prostate

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The second group received
no medical treatment at all.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
What they actually received
were lifestyle changes--

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
how to eat a healthier diet,
how to meditate and eliminate

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.095 align:middle line:90%
stress.

00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
what's relevant?

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:90%
And here's what's relevant.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They read the genetic profile of
patients in each of the groups

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:90%
before the experiment.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:90%
The experiment lasted 90 days.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
After 90 days, they read the
gene profile from the patients

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
in each group, and
what did they find out?

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
In the experimental group that
received no medical treatment

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
at all, only lifestyle
changes, over 500 genes

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
change their function just
by changing lifestyle.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And most of these genes were
associated with a developing

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:90%
prostate cancer.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
what does this mean?

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to kill
the cancer cells.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
They're just the symptom of
a life that's not in harmony.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
What they did is create
a better lifestyle

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:90%
for these individuals.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And once they started
to become healthier

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
using this much more
effective lifestyle,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it also changed their
genetic readout.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics, again, is
involved with changing

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
the genetic readout, and
it's involved with cancer

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:90%
for a very simple reason.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
There is no gene
that causes cancer.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:10%
When a person is not living
in harmony in their world,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:10%
when they're under stress
or they're living out

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:10%
of balance with nature,
that's the initiating step

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:10%
that will activate what
is called an oncogene,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:10%
a cancer gene.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
The cancer gene did
not activate itself,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
it was activated in
response to the environment.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Total importance of
this understanding

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
is, how did the
environment alter

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%
the expression of the genes?

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics environmental
signals crossed into the cells

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and altered the
readout of these genes.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Another understanding which
is fairly important as well

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is, how long does it take
for epigenetic mechanisms

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:90%
to take effect?

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Days, weeks, months?

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, an interesting study
was done with meditators.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:10%
What they did is they
read two genes that

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:10%
were associated
with inflammation,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:10%
and then the meditators
went under eight hours

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:10%
of meditation practice.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
After eight hours, they read
the genes, and guess what?

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The gene activity changed in
just eight hours of meditation.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So we once were led to
believe that our genes are

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:90%
like concrete.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your genes are,
that's the story of your life.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Now we can find that, in
as little as eight hours,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
you can change gene activity
by changing lifestyle,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:84%
or in this case, changing
the consciousness

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:90%
through meditation.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But now we put this
all back together again

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.510 align:middle line:84%
with an important
understanding, and that

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is, the protein sleeve
on the chromosome

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
is what is controlling
the activity of the gene.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:10%
So instead of DNA, RNA, and
protein, now, above the DNA

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:10%
we must put regulatory proteins
because regulatory proteins

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:10%
determine which DNA is going
to be read, turned into RNA,

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and then turned into protein.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Yet, that's still not the
entire chain of control.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:84%
What controls
regulatory proteins?

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Environmental signals.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the flow of information
starts with the primary cause,

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
as the environment.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The environmental signals
activate epigenetic control

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:90%
through the regulatory proteins.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:84%
The epigenetic control selects
which DNA is going to be read.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
The epigenetic controls also
determine the blueprint copy

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of that DNA because
it can alter the RNA.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
variations come from.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And then the RNA is used
to make the protein.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
No longer is it the primacy
of DNA in our understanding.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.020 align:middle line:10%
It's actually now the
primacy of the environment.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the environment,
through epigenetics,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately
determine which genes are read

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:90%
and how they will be read.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
the conclusion is clear.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
You control your
gene activity by how

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:90%
you respond to the environment.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And by definition,
a lack of knowledge

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
represents a lack of power.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The misinformation generated
by the outdated theory

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of genetic determinism
has systematically

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.860 align:middle line:84%
disempowered people
by inferring that they

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:90%
are victims of their heredity.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The new insights
offered by epigenetics

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
empowers individuals
because it reveals

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can regulate our
own genome by changing

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
our environment or changing our
perceptions of the environment.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The next episode will focus on
the mind's role in programming

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the character of our genome
and our life experiences.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.
