00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What is conscious evolution?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on Inner Evolution.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
The fractal character of
nature offers deep insight

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
into understanding how to
live in health and harmony

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
by studying the behaviors
of other forms of life.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Human hubris leads us to
believe that we are the highest

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:90%
level of earthly intelligence.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And as one descends through
the lineage of lower animals,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
going toward the base
of the tree of life,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
each is endowed with lesser
and lesser intelligence.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Single cells are near
the base of this tree.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
How much intelligence
could a cell have?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Conventional perception would
say very little, if any.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The community of single cells
were smart enough to make

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
humans using technologies
that we cannot yet fathom.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
In this session, we use
nature's fractal geometry

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to gain insight on the
mechanics of evolution.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The metric of evolution
is not based on genes,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
but on the development
of the nervous system.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Starting with the primitive
prokaryote organisms,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
we can assess the
hierarchy of evolution

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
by measuring an organism's
membrane surface area.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
This approach not only
illuminates the pattern

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
of past evolutionary
advances, more importantly,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
we can use the same assessment
to project the exciting vision

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%
of our future--

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:90%
conscious evolution.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
In previous episodes,
what we really discussed

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
was the nature of
how cells work,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:90%
where intelligence comes from.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
At first it was thought
that intelligence

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
was based on the number
of genes an organism has.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
what led scientists

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to pursue what is called
the Human Genome Project.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In the failure of finding
100,000 anticipated genes

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
in a human, it was necessary
to go back and consider, what

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:90%
is evolution actually based on?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And in 1809, a scientist in
France, John-Baptise Lamarck,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
was the first scientist
to actually write

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:90%
a theory of evolution.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And in his theory,
Lamarck said evolution

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
was reflected in the development
of the nervous system.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can look at that
same understanding today

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, yes,
humans have, indeed,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
a profoundly more
effective nervous system

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:90%
than lower organisms.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's a problem--

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
how do you measure intelligence
in a nervous system?

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we discussed
earlier in this series,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:90%
all cells have intelligence.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
look at the human.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We could go down and look
at a very primitive cell

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and say, what is intelligence
in a primitive organism?

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
In our effort to
understand that,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
we started to focus
on the cell membrane--

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
the skin of the cell.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
there are proteins

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
built into the
membrane which consist

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:84%
of a receptor and
an effector protein.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at these
protein complexes

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
of the receptor-effector,
and guess what we recognized?

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
By definition, the
receptor represents

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
awareness of the environment
through physical sensation.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The significance
of this definition

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is it is the exact
same definition

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
word "perception."

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:10%
So instead of calling
these proteins

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:10%
a receptor-effector integral
membrane protein complex,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:10%
we can simply refer to these
proteins as perceptions.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Significance of
that is a perception

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is a foundational
unit of consciousness.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So as perceptions
increase, so is there

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
an increase in consciousness.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Significance is profound,
because it basically

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:84%
says if you want to
measure consciousness,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
then the fundamental
unit of consciousness

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is a unit called a
perception unit, which

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
is a receptor-effector
protein complex.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes
interesting, because if we

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
want to measure consciousness
in evolution, what we're really

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
going to measure is the increase
in these protein complexes.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
In our previous discussion,
we also recognize the fact

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that the membrane,
by definition,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
is an information processor--
the equivalent of a chip.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And that the
receptor-effector proteins

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.375 align:middle line:84%
are the equivalent
of a bit of data.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about computers,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about how
intelligent is your computer?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And the answer comes down
to, how many bits of data

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
can your computer handle?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, it actually applies
exactly the same to organisms.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:10%
In other words, simply this--

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:10%
how many bits of data in a
membrane does a cell have?

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden
we say, now there's

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:10%
a physical metric to
measure consciousness--

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:10%
the receptor-effector units.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the significant aspect of
reading how many of these units

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
are found in a membrane is
a very interesting concept

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
based on how can these
proteins fit into the membrane?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Significance is this-- the
membrane has a thickness

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:90%
of about 10 nanometers.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is a dimension defined
by the lipid molecules that

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
create the basic structure
of this membrane barrier.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Relevance is the
proteins-- bits--

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.014 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about have
essentially the same dimension.

00:05:58.014 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
This becomes very important,
because it says this--

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
if you want to add more bits
of proteins, more perception

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
into the membrane, you
can't stack the proteins

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
on top of each other, because
the size of the membrane

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is previously defined
by the phospholipids.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.465 align:middle line:84%
You can only lay them out in a
flat surface of the membrane.

00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:90%
I go, wow.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you
understand this fact--

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
the number of bits in a membrane
is determined by the surface

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
area of the membrane.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The more membrane there
is, the more perception

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
bits I can put
into the membrane.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I can measure consciousness by
measuring an organism's surface

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But now, when we go back
and look at the evolution,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
we start off with a
very primitive organism,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
prokaryote, the bacteria.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I say significance
of this is

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that this is the first organism,
and it also has consciousness.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Yes, a bacterium can be
aware of the environment

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and make an appropriate
life-sustaining response--

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
which is the definition
of consciousness--

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:90%
awareness of the environment.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And the awareness of the
environment, of course,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
is due to the protein bits
built into the cell membrane.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So we want to measure the
surface area of a bacteria

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
membrane, and that will give
us a readout of how much

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
consciousness the
bacterium can have. ,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Well bacteria are like
invertebrates, like insects.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They have a hard, outer shell.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It's actually called a capsule.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And the capsule defines
the size of a bacterium.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Significance-- the size
of a bacterial cell

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is limited by this
external capsule.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:10%
If you look underneath
the capsule,

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:10%
you'll see the membrane
of the bacterium.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:10%
And you can calculate
the surface area,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and then get an idea of
how much consciousness

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:10%
this bacterium expresses.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.020 align:middle line:10%
And as bacteria
evolved, they actually

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:10%
expanded their membrane a
bit, causing the membrane

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:10%
to fold inside of the cell as
illustrated in this picture.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
This folding of the membrane
is called the mesosome.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
The significance?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It expands surface area.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Relevance?

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
More surface area,
more intelligence.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
However, there's a problem.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You can only put
so much membrane

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
within the capsule
of the bacterium.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And it basically said this--

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
when bacteria were
created, the membrane

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
representing consciousness
was increasing

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:84%
as the bacterial cell
gained more consciousness,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
but then it reaches
a finite size.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't put any more
membrane in a bacterium.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
If the expansion of the membrane
is an expression of evolution,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden a
bacterium reaches a finite size

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and can't put any
more membrane in it,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
my goodness, what
this really represents

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:90%
is that evolution stopped.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't make a
smarter bacterium.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But obviously
evolution didn't stop.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
What happened is a second
phase of evolution.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:84%
In phase 2 of evolution,
bacteria came together

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
in community to share
awareness, and this made

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
a more intelligent community.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we recognize, in
our evolutionary story,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
bacteria communities surrounded
themselves with a membrane.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.005 align:middle line:84%
And in this membrane were
not just the same bacteria.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:10%
There were a
mixture of bacteria,

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:10%
with different bacteria
expressing different functions.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But by collaborating,
the community

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
was more advanced than
any single bacterium

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:90%
could have become.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:90%
So evolution now has two phases.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Phase 1, make the
smartest individual cell,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:10%
and then phase 2, bring the
smartest individuals together

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:10%
and create a community,
because in community,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:10%
shared awareness could advance
the intelligence of the group.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
So what do we have?

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
First level of evolution,
single bacteria.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we made the
smartest bacteria.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:10%
They formed a community,
surrounded themselves

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:10%
with a membrane.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And in biology we
call this a biofilm--

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
a heterogeneous community of
bacteria living in harmony.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, is that the evolution end?

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
What happened is nature made
the system more efficient.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Rather than each bacterium
living on its own

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
in the community and providing
some function, what happened

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
over evolution was this--

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
the genes of the
individual bacteria

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
were coalesced into a single
structure called the nucleus.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And so now all of
the genetic activity

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of all the different
bacteria are

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
coalesced into one
nucleus containing

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
all of the information,
and then all

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden this
former community

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of biofilm with a
membrane around it

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:90%
turns into a new organism.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It becomes what we
refer to as eukaryote--

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
an organism that
has a nucleus in it.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The nucleus is the
repository of all the genes

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:90%
of the former community.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
In addition, something
new happened.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead of putting a capsule
to contain this community,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:84%
actually, an
internal skeleton was

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
created, because with
an internal skeleton

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
you can expand the
surface area, where

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't do that when
there was a hard shell

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:90%
outside of the cell.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:10%
So with an internal
cytoskeleton,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:10%
the new cell that formed,
the eukaryotic cell,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:10%
is represented by something
that we would call an amoeba.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
An amoeba is a new
identification.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:10%
An amoeba represents
an advanced evolution

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:10%
of a former community
of bacteria,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:10%
but now it's a single organism.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And I go, so what?

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the expansion
of a cytoskeleton,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
you can use the
membrane like a tent.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:84%
The more cytoskeleton, the more
surface area the cell can have.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So a single amoeba has 1,000
times more surface area

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:90%
than a single bacterium.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Since surface area is a
measure of consciousness,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
then all of a sudden you can
recognize the amoeba cell

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is 1,000 times more conscious
than a single bacterium.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in the
next phase of evolution?

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
You make the smartest
amoeba possible by enhancing

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:90%
the membranes of this structure.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And then I say, wow.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Now we start with a new
organism, the amoeba,

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and make it smart by increasing
its membrane surface area.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness, there's
a physical limitation

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:90%
here as well.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And that limitation is
simply due to this--

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
a membrane around a cell is
containing the cytoplasm.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:10%
But the membrane structure can
only contain so much cytoplasm,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:10%
because if there's
too much cytoplasm,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:10%
the pressure on
the membrane would

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:10%
cause the membrane to rupture,
and that would kill the cell.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:10%
To give you an analogy of
what I mean, is simply this--

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:10%
if we take a balloon and
put a small amount of water

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:10%
in this balloon, we could throw
that balloon around all day

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:10%
long.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you put too much
water in the balloon

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and you try and
throw the balloon,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
the membrane of the
balloon would rupture,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and the water would all run
out, and the game is over.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact analogy
of why an amoeba reached

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:90%
a limited size--

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because like that water balloon,
if the amoeba gets too big,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
the membrane ruptures.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:90%
The cell is dead.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Game over.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden I
say, well, wait a minute.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a maximum
size to an amoeba?

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, then there's
a maximum amount

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of membrane an amoeba can have.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about a repeat
of an evolutionary pattern,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
because the new
organism-- the amoeba--

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the next phase of
evolution was to enhance

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the membrane capacity
of that cell.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But then, like the bacterium,
it reaches a finite size.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't make a smarter amoeba.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Evolution ended again.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:10%
But just like in
the previous phase,

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:10%
we advanced evolution not
by making a smarter amoeba,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:10%
but by bringing
amoebas into community

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:10%
and putting a large membrane
around the community

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.490 align:middle line:10%
of amoebas.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, what
did this provide for?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It provides for the animals
and plants that we observe.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, all
animals and plants that we see

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually communities
of individual cells

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:90%
under one membrane or one skin.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:10%
A human, for example,
is a community

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:10%
of about 50 trillion amoebas
living under one skin.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:10%
I say, what was the relevance?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:10%
When I couldn't make
the amoeba any smarter,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:10%
just as in the case of bacteria,
we bring the amoebas together

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:10%
in a community to share
awareness and advance

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:10%
the intelligence of
the entire community.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I go, wow.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden I say,
what's the consequence of that?

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a cycle that we
now see between two phases.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Phase 1, make the smartest
individual you can.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:10%
Phase 2, then bring those
individuals together

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:10%
in a community, share
awareness, and ultimately that

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:10%
leads to the next
higher form of life.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:10%
So just like the
community of bacteria

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:10%
created a new
organism, the amoeba,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:10%
the communities
of amoebas created

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:10%
a new organism such as a human.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:90%
And I go, wow.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden
there's a pattern

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can observe
in evolution.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:84%
First make the
smartest individual,

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and then bring those
individuals together

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
into a community
and share awareness.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a spiral
of evolution,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
starting with bacteria,
then creating amoebas,

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
and then ultimately, what?

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Creating a human.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about that is this pattern

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:90%
repeats itself at a third level.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I go, what's the third level?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the next
phase of evolution was?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Make the smartest single
human you could create.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:10%
I say, remember the
story of the bacterium--

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:10%
you can only put
so much membrane

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:10%
inside that external capsule?

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, guess what?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
applies in humans,

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and the capsule I'm talking
about is the cranium--

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:90%
the skull.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
How much brain can you
put inside a human?

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is it
reaches a finite size.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And significance to that
is if we look at the brains

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
of primitive vertebrates--
let's say a rat--

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
you could see that
inside its skull,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
the brain is just like one
rounded bubble, like a balloon

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:90%
inside of the skull.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:10%
But when you start to
look at the human, what

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:10%
you find is the
brain of the human

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:10%
is now folded into what
we call sulci and gyri.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:10%
I say, so what's the
significance of the folds?

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:10%
More surface area.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:36.472 align:middle line:10%
And this is an expression
of more intelligence.

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it's
real interesting,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:10%
because if you
compare the folding

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:10%
of the brain in the human
skull and compare it

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:10%
to that bacterium
with a mesosome,

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:10%
it's both exactly
the same pattern.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:84%
More surface area,
more intelligence.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:84%
A human will reach a finite
amount of intelligence.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't add any more
brain inside the skull.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I go, wait, that means
when the human evolved,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
the next phase of
evolution was what?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Make the most powerful
nervous system

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
by making folds and gyri in
the surface of the brain,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
increasing the
intelligence, maximizing it.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, oh,
evolution ended again.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:90%
With what?

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:90%
The smartest human.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't make a
human any smarter.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There's no more room
inside the skull.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
then what happened?

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, this is
the beautiful part

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
about fractals and structural
repeats, and that is this--

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
what did the bacterium do when
it reached its maximum level

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Formed a community of bacteria.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
What did the amoeba
do when it reached

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
its full level of intelligence?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It created a
community of amoebas.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
What would the human
do when it reaches

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:90%
its full level of intelligence?

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we have seen and
observed in our history,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we started making communities--
first families and then tribes,

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and then states,
and then nations--

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:90%
are what?

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Assemblies of
smartest individuals

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
working together to
create more intelligence.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's a pattern
to evolution.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Phase 1, make the
smartest individual.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Phase 2, make a community out
of those smart individuals,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and that leads to the next
higher level of organization.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
If we understand the
conventional story of evolution

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
as in Darwinian theory, it's
a belief that you start with

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
a very primitive
organism-- a bacterium--

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and through billions
of years, there's

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
slight changes from one
organism to the next organism,

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
so it's one, continuous
process of evolution.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I go, that is a mistake,
because it wasn't one,

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:90%
continuous evolutionary process.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
There were stages-- a step,
followed by another step,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:90%
followed by another step.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:10%
Step 1, bacteria, then
forming bacterial films,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:10%
then evolving into amoeba.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:10%
Step 2, make the
smartest amoeba,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:10%
form a community of amoebas,
lead to the human being.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:10%
That was the evolution of that
community, end of phase 2.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:10%
Then what would be phase 3?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:10%
Start with the smartest
human, bring them together

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:10%
in a community, and
what do we end up with?

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:10%
An evolution of a new organism.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:10%
What is the new organism?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Humanity.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Humanity, when we finally
get to understand this--

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:10%
it's not the
individual human, it's

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:10%
the collective
community of humans.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And what that ultimately
represents is that each of us

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
is a cell in a body of a bigger
organism called humanity, where

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
all of our intelligence
is collective together,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
creating the smartest
next version--

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:90%
human civilization.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are now at the approach
of actually experiencing

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
this evolutionary step.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what
is necessary for us

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to pursue this evolution?

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this--

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:84%
the assembly of all human
cells into a new organism.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's going
to happen, guess what?

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to break down the
barriers of separation,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%
the borders between nations.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to start recognizing
that every human is part

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of the same living organism,
that every human is

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of a
cell in your body.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:84%
All of us humans
have to recognize

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
we're all part of one thing.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:90%
The consequence is this--

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:84%
we have to recognize that every
other human on this planet

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
is part of the same
body, which means what?

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop
fighting each other.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop the trouble
that occurs between nations

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and groups of people, because
that's tantamount to what

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
we would refer to
in human health

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
as autoimmune disease,
which is simply defined

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
as a disease as a result of
cells fighting each other.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what
autoimmune disease is.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Cells in your body start to
actually break apart and break

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the community up,
which then leads

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
to disease, and
ultimately death.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
If humans do not
really recognize

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that our fate is
coming together in one,

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
giant organism called
humanity-- if we

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
don't recognize that, then
the fate of human civilization

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to come to
a very abrupt end.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we're
facing this end right now,

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
because as we started
off the program,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the concept
called the sixth mass

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:90%
extinction of life.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And guess what it's driven by?

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Human behavior.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We're destroying the environment
that provides for us.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:90%
How do we resolve this issue?

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Come together, form
one global community,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and start recognizing that
in order for us to survive,

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
not only must humans live in
harmony with other humans,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but humans must learn to live
in harmony with the environment,

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
because once we
do that, we become

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
a powerful force on
this planet to create

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:90%
that next level of evolution--

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
a super organism
called humanity.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're on the threshold
of that right now.

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:90%
But are we going to make it?

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
question for all of you

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.183 align:middle line:84%
to consider at this time,
because there's no set answer.

00:23:36.183 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
There have been
civilizations that

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
have been very advanced
on this planet long

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
before our civilization,
and they've disappeared.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, we used to think
that civilization was created

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
around 5,000 B.C. in the area of
the Tigris and Euphrates River,

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
where the Phoenicians
and the Babylonians

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:90%
were creating civilization.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We said, oh, that's
the first civilization.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Now archaeologists
have uncovered

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that were
even 5,000 years earlier

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:90%
than that one.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:10%
Now we know, for
example, in Turkey,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:10%
there was a civilization in
an area called Gobekli Tepe,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:10%
and this civilization
ended 10,000 years ago.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to those people.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Point is very clear--

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
civilization has reached
higher levels before,

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and then it's disappeared.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment, we are
facing our own extinction

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
if we don't get it
together and start

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to recognize for us to
survive, all humans have

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to recognize they're all
part of one community--

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.130 align:middle line:84%
a community of
advanced intelligence

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that will provide for the
new organism, humanity.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:10%
So when we look back on
the nature of evolution,

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:10%
if we look at a
spiral from the side,

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:10%
it will have an
image such as this.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And we can see, at the bottom
level of the first rung,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:10%
is bacteria.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And as bacteria increased
their intelligence, created

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.220 align:middle line:10%
a community, they led to the
second level of the spiral,

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:10%
consisting of the single
cells such as an amoeba.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:10%
That community of amoebas led
to the human being, comprised

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:10%
of 50 trillion amoebas.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:10%
And then the next
pattern begins.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:10%
Once we had the smartest
human, then the humans

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:10%
started to come together
and form community.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:10%
And where are we now?

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:10%
We're approaching the next level
of the spiral called humanity.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Humanity then has us as
the cells as the foundation

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of humanity's structure.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.035 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, is
that the end of evolution?

00:25:41.035 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I go, maybe not,
because I actually

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:90%
believe the following--

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is the
equivalent of a cell.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And when humans maximize
the intelligence,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
then the intelligence
of the Earth

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.667 align:middle line:84%
is complete, just like a
final development of a cell.

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, then what would

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
happen if the Earth
completes its intelligence?

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
As in the pattern of
evolution we've already seen,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
if the Earth represents
an intelligent cell,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:84%
maximizes intelligence,
then the individual cells

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
come together and
create a community.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what would that
mean in regard to the Earth?

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the Earth is a cell,
maximizes its intelligence,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
the next level of
evolution beyond that

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
would be bringing more
earths, different worlds

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
together as individual
cells to create what?

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
A community of planets
sharing awareness.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe that future with
aliens is actually not unreal.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's possible, when
we complete our evolution,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
we will then have an
opportunity to communicate

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:90%
with those other worlds.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're on the edge of a
future that we don't know.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, at this
immediate moment in history,

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
our future may be limited if
we don't really come together

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that every human
is part of the same body,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and that if we work
together in harmony,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
we'll maximize humanity,
and we'll maximize life

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth,
which will then allow

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
us to join the other
planets in the universe.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a possibility, and a
very interesting reality

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So the relevance of nature
being fractal in its geometry

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is really important for
us, because not only can we

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
use the as above, so below
understanding of a fractal

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to really understand how we
got to this particular point.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It can also be used to tell us
how we can move into the future

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
successfully, and
survive and actually

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:90%
thrive into that future.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
changing our genetics.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
changing our physical body.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's changing our consciousness.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We are not individual
elements on the planet,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
as each person
thinks they might be.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We are all one of a whole,
a community that is forming.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The future looks very
bright, and it's a future

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:90%
based on conscious evolution.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The future of human
civilization is not

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:84%
yet set, for we are now at
an evolutionary crossroad.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:10%
We will either learn to
evolve as an integrated global

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:10%
community, or we will face our
own demise in the current phase

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:10%
of mass extinction.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.280 align:middle line:84%
The solution to human
survival requires the collapse

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of our current
civilization, which

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for the mass
extinction we're facing.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
a new civilization,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:84%
we can create a new world
based on global cooperativity.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.940 align:middle line:84%
The planetary chaos we
are now experiencing

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:84%
is actually a very positive
step for the future of humans,

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
for it is forcing us to
re-evaluate who we are

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and how we should manage our
lives and our relationship

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Toward this end, the insights
of the new biology described

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in this series provides
us with an opportunity

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss the idea
of our being victims,

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and acquire self-empowerment to
take control over our own lives

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and create a future we
can all thrive into.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on inner revolution

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:90%
through biological change.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I hope I was able to
help you understand

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
how you have the power to
change your inner world

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and your outer world.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Your ability to
master change will

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
provide for a new evolution
that will allow civilization

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:90%
to thrive into the future.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:90%
