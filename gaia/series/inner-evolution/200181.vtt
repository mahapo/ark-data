00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> When I started my research
back in 1967 at the University

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
of Virginia, I was working with
the early leaders of stem cell

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Biologists thought that
genes would turn themselves

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:90%
on and off.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
However, in the stem
cell cultures with

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Which I was working, I
noticed that the cells

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
altered their gene expression
based on their environment.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
My colleagues
thought I was nuts.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But in 1991, science finally
realized that my observations

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:90%
were accurate.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And they coined the new insights
as the science of epigenetics.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I am your host, Bruce Lipton.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And as a pioneer in the research
of stem cells in epigenetics,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:10%
I hope to share with you a
scientific approach as to how

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:10%
spirit exists in every part of
our body, a new awareness that

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:10%
can create an inner evolution.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.275 align:middle line:90%

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Before we can dive
into this research

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and its positive effects
on our human civilization,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
we must first address the
current state of global chaos

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and how an understanding
of how our bodies work

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
offers a better life for us as
individuals and a better future

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.683 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's begin with some facts.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Human behavior has precipitated
the planet's sixth mass

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:90%
extinction event.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And civilization
as we know it is

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
facing an irreversible collapse
within the coming decades.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Are the global
crises we now face

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
a portent of the
end of civilization,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
or are they a sign for the
beginning of a better one?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Five times in the history of
this planet, life was thriving,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and some natural event caused
from 70% to 95% of all life

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:90%
to go extinct.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The last time this happened
was 66 million years ago

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:90%
when the dinosaurs were here.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
A comet hit near Mexico,
upended the environment,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and wiped out over
90% of all life,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:90%
including all of the dinosaurs.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, today,
scientists recognize

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
we are now facing the
sixth mass extinction

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:90%
event on this planet.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the previous
five, which were

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
due to natural events such
as comets hitting the planet

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
or tectonic plate movements, the
current sixth mass extinction

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is actually due
to human behavior.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, in 1970, the
World Wildlife Foundation

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
did a survey of how many
animals were on this planet.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Recently, they redid the survey.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And guess what they found.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Over 63% of the
animals that were on

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:84%
this planet have
disappeared since 1970.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We only have one third
of the animals left.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Another study on
insects in Germany

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
revealed over the last
17 years that there's

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
been a 75% reduction in insects
in their national parks.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the sea,
the same kind of thing

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, science
has recognized

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that there will be no saltwater
fish left in the ocean by 2048.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And we see all these changes
occurring and, along with it,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
climate change.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And people talk
about climate change.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the weather
is kind of strange.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But we always focus on the fact
that the melting of the ice

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
caps is going to
cause rising seas,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
affect the planet.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But people don't really
recognize there's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%
something even more profound.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when
climate change occurs,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
we cannot predict agriculture.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't know when plants
will grow to their fullest

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
maturity, when we'll be
able to harvest them,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.582 align:middle line:84%
when it will rain,
when it will be sunny.

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
climate change

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is now threatening the
food supply of this planet.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
NASA, few years ago,
had taken a survey

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
of what was going on in the
planet and came to a conclusion

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that industrial
civilization is facing

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
an irreversible
collapse, that we are now

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:90%
facing our own extinction.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, crises
as we experience

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
them are precipitating
an evolution.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And this evolution is
changing our civilization.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And if we look over the history
of Western civilization,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
we find that there
were civilizations that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:90%
were here and have disappeared.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
We go back 10,000
years ago, and there

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
were animists, the native
people of the world,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans, the
Indians in South America,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
the druids in Europe.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
All of these people
lived in a world

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
of animism, which meant that
spirit and matter were one

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and the same, and that
living on this planet you

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
would honor both the material
realm and the spiritual realm.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
However, animism faded away as
polytheism came into presence.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And polytheism, such as
the Greeks, the Romans,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians--
what did they do?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:10%
They actually took
the spirit out

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:10%
of the individuals of the
world, as the animists

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:10%
saw it, and coalesced
these spirits

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:10%
into gods, multiple gods, a
god of water, a god of crops,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:10%
a god of stars, gods for
everything that we saw.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But it took spirituality
out of our everyday world

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and put them into
figurehead gods.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Polytheism also faded out
as a new belief, monotheism,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
came into being.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Monotheism collected all of
the spirit of this planet,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
put it into one
god, and actually

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:90%
sent that god off the planet.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So we left a time
behind where everything

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
was spiritual to a current time
where nothing is spiritual,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:90%
except god in another place.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And after monotheism, a new and
current civilization arrived,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and that is called
scientific materialism.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And scientific materialism
is today's world

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
where we start to recognize
there's a material realm

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and that we don't even need to
understand a spiritual realm.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We can live here with
just understanding

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:84%
the physical, material
nature of the planet.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you can see, we've been
through several civilizations.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually facing the
end of the current civilization

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of scientific materialism.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
A civilization has a life cycle,
like anything in the universe.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
A star is born,
matures, and dies.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
People are born,
mature, and die.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And so does a civilization.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a civilization
is created,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
the first phase is like that,
where children are experiencing

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
life, a developmental
phase, a developmental phase

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
where we try all different
kinds of things, try them out.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
However, as we mature,
we begin to have

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
very rigid beliefs about
how the way civilization

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:90%
and the universe works.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an
unfortunate part of that,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because once we
have a rigid belief,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
we're in trouble for
a very simple reason.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in the universe
stays the same.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything is always moving
and transforming itself.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So the reality of a
rigid belief actually

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
leads to crises, challenges
that we must face.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Not facing those challenges
causes a civilization

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to actually go into
decline and collapse.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, today's civilization is
surely facing the challenges.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is watch the
news on TV, read the newspaper,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
go on the internet, or even
just look out your window,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that chaos
abounds all over the planet.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The significance
about this chaos

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we are now
recognizing we are not

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
sustainable in the
way we are living.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely means we must
change the nature of life

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Human behavior is the
source of the problem.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
An important point to note
in the face of the sixth mass

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
extinction is a
very profound fact.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Crisis precipitates evolution.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So as our current civilization
is in a state of failure,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
a new civilization
is being seeded.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
the viewers of Gaia

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
are part of this major
new influx of information,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
because Gaia viewers are
cultural creatives looking

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
for a better way to
live on this planet.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:84%
So let's understand how we got
into the current civilization

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going
to move into a better

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:90%
civilization in the future.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
Scientific materialism,
the civilization

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
we're in right now,
was actually founded

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
in the works of Isaac Newton.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:10%
He was studying the
movements of the universe

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:10%
and looking at the
universe as a machine.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:10%
And why that was important
is that Isaac Newton

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.870 align:middle line:10%
created what we call classical
physics, or Newtonian physics.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:10%
And what's it based on?

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, Isaac Newton, in
studying the movements

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
of the planets of
the solar system,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
interestingly enough had to
actually create something

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:90%
before physics.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
He created calculus.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:10%
No little, small adventure
on the way to understanding

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:10%
physics, using the calculus
equations what Newton did

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:10%
was put in the physical
characteristics of the planets,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:10%
how big they are, their mass,
how fast they're moving,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:10%
and the vectors of their orbits.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And using this data, he
solved the equations,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to
accurately predict

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.412 align:middle line:84%
the movements of the
planets in the solar system.

00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And you may say, well,
what's the significance?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is very important.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time
of Isaac Newton,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
we were living in a
civilization called monotheism.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, this led to a
belief in materialism.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton, in providing
this new insight,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
actually was
considered a heretic

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
because the church was
running civilization,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and Isaac Newton's data did not
fit the infallible knowledge

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:90%
offered by the church.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
However, to proceed, science
had to make a detente

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
with the church.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it worked
out, very simply this.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Science said, we will only study
the material, physical realm

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, leaving
behind all the invisible stuff.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And that they left to
religion, such as spirit.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
This was the separation of
physics and metaphysics,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
physics saying, we will not
deal with the invisible realm

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll understand life just
through the physical realm

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and therefore not step on
the feet of the church,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
which was actually
running civilization.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, through this process of
studying the material realm,

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.363 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton again
was able to predict

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:90%
the movement of the planets.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
of that is prediction

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:90%
is the hallmark of science.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
If you can predict
something, it generally

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
means that you understand
the mechanism behind it.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So this led Newtonian physics
to a new understanding

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
of how the universe works.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
From that time, assumptions
were made about the universe.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
assumptions which

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I call myth perceptions,
myths that we

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:90%
accepted as scientific truth.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we created a
culture based on these myths.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the significance is, today,
these four fundamental myths

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that shape our world have been
actually found to be incorrect

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:90%
or outright false.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We've built a civilization
on incorrect information.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's just list these
four myth-perceptions.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The first myth-perception
is the fact

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that biology is based
on Newtonian physics.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
of that is that we

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
believe that our biology
and physical, chemical body

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
conforms to the
laws of chemistry

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and that if we can
understand the chemistry,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:90%
we'll understand life.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It leaves out what was called
spirit and invisible moving

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
forces, because in
the Newtonian physics,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:84%
material science said,
ignore those elements,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
not necessary to
understanding life.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem with that
is, in 1925, a new physics

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:90%
came into being.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics revealed
that the universe is not

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
a duality of matter and energy,
that the entire universe is

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
made out of one thing, energy,
and that humans, while we have

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the appearance of
being physical,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
are actually energy beings
along with all the other energy

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And the significance of that,
according to quantum physics,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is there is an energy
of who we are, an energy

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in the field of humans.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've left this
out of the equation

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
because it was an
invisible realm and not

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:90%
subject to Newtonian physics.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:90%
An important point--

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics is
still alive and viable.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Just because quantum
physics came in,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
we must recognize that Newtonian
physics is a small subdivision

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:90%
of quantum physics.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So Isaac Newton's
equations still work,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:90%
but they're incomplete.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to discuss
this in the series,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
getting into the nature
of quantum physics

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and its influence on
our human biology.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
A second myth is that
genes control biology.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is totally
wrong, as we now know,

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
because there's a new
science called epigenetics.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we had a belief
that genes controlled our life,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:90%
then consider this.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.965 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, we didn't
pick the genes we came with.

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If we don't like the
characteristics we have,

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:90%
we can't change that genes.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're told that genes
turn on and off by themselves.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at it that way,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
recognize, then, we

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:90%
are victims of our heredity.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's cancer
running in my family,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and I can get the cancer
gene, or Alzheimer's

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
running in my family and
I'll get Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
belief that the genes

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
are going to convey
what kind of life

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:90%
we will have on this planet.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is totally false.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Genes are not capable
of turning on and off,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to discuss
that in this series.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But what we really should
understand is this,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
the new science
called epigenetics.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it sounds like
genetics, epigenetics.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I go, it's a revolution.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:90%
It's an evolution.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is a
brand new science.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.967 align:middle line:84%
And the important part
is the prefix "epi."

00:14:31.967 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:90%
"Epi" means "above."

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, skin
is called epidermis.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So "epidermis" means
"above the dermis."

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're talking
about epigenetics.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Translated, epigenetic
control simply

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
means control above the genes.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we recognize that the
environment and specifically

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
our perception of
the environment

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
is what controls our genes.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Since we can control
the environment,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
since we can control
our perceptions,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
then we're not victims
of our genetics.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:90%
We are masters of our genetics.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
A third myth about
our civilization

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
based on the Darwinian theory
of evolution-- as most of us

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
have learned, in
the Darwinian theory

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
there's a character
called survival

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
of the fittest in the
competition for life.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
What all this represents
is the belief that animals

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:90%
reproduce faster than plants.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Over time, there'll be
more and more and more

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
animals and less
and less plants.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, that will mean
there is competition.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Whichever animals get
the food can stay alive,

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and whichever animals
don't get the food will

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:90%
pass by the wayside.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So given a belief that life
is a struggle of competition

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to survive on this planet, and
the simple reality is, then,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that makes our planet a war
zone with people competing

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:90%
against people all of the time.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So is competition the ground
of the world in which we live?

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely not.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Science has now
recognized that it

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
is cooperation that
drives evolution,

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%
the complete opposite.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Rather than fighting
with each other,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
our evolution is based on
working together in harmony

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and creating a future
as a collective nature

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:90%
of an entire civilization.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's the third myth,
the myth that we're here

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to struggle in life.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It's false.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The fourth myth, which is also
related to Darwinian theory,

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is based on this
very simple fact.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
According to the Darwinian
theory of evolution,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
the first step in
evolution is generated

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
by what is called a random
mutation, an alteration

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:84%
of the genetics that changes
the character of that individual

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and can be propagated
by reproduction.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it said,
how did we get here?

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a series
of random accidents

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that led to our evolution.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Then why are we here?

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:90%
The shake of genetic dice.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason
for us to be here.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
crux of the problem

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from, because we
say, is there a purpose

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:90%
for human civilization?

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to the
fact that we evolved

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
through a whole set of random,
accidental mutations, well then

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:90%
the answer is, not that we know.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:90%
There's no purpose at all.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
It was all chance.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We now know that that
idea of random mutations

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
as the origin of
evolution is incorrect,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that animals and
organisms on this planet

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
are well adapted to
every environment.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not a
coincidence that there

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:84%
are no orchids in Antarctica
and there are no polar bears

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Each of the plants and
animals on this planet

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
are fitting perfectly into the
environment in which they live.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that a coincidence?

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that organisms
adapt their genetics

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to conform to the environment.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, then,
it says, and why are we here?

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we were adapting
to an environment.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And to do what?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Bring harmony to
that environment.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what nature seeks,
balance and harmony.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
As one organism
gets out of control,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:84%
another organism will come
in and neutralize that.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So as you go up the
evolutionary scale,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
every new organism brought
into the environment

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:84%
had more power than the
lower organism in what?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Creating harmony and
balance in the world.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we understand
that, and we go back,

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to the animists,
the Native Americans,

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:90%
what was their understanding?

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That the environment
was a garden.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And what was their job?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
They were gardeners
in that environment.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They were there to help and
maintain the environment.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that idea is completely
gone from today's civilization.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Today, we upend the environment
to seek out all the material

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
wealth that we've
been looking for.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We're destroying the planet
underneath our own feet.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:10%
We're not living in
harmony with the planet.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:10%
We're actually destroying the
planet and now, as a result,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:10%
facing an extinction
that we have created.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So an important
understanding is this.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We have built a culture
on these four beliefs.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And these four beliefs are
now patently incorrect.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So to change our
civilization, we

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:84%
have to now change our culture
to accommodate the new insights

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
about why we're here, the nature
of our physical or energetic

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:90%
universe, the nature of genes.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are up
for a new reconsideration,

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
a new look.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And why is this important?

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Because how we adapt to these
understandings of nature

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow us to
survive into the future.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
As Albert Einstein
said, you can not

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
solve the problems using
the same thinking that

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
created the problems.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The four myths we just
described are the problems.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And by following these problems
and making life based on them,

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:90%
look where we are.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So the understanding is this.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
go back into the world

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and understand how we are
involved with the garden

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:90%
that we inherited.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Because there's still time
for us to change the way

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we are living on
this planet, to learn

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to live in harmony with nature,
and forestall that sixth mass

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:90%
extinction.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to have
to do it relatively soon.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this process, one of
the most important things

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:90%
we're going to learn is this.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
There's more to a human than
this physical expression.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
spiritual component.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a new-age idea.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually founded
in the hard science

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:90%
of quantum physics.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And why we are going
to go into this

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
is to give you your
power back, because we

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
have lost our powers.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, we didn't lose them
because we don't have power.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We lost our powers because we've
been programmed to be weak.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We bought the
program, and now we

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:90%
find ourselves to be powerless.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the farthest
thing from the truth.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We're extremely
powerful individuals.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In looking at the world today,
we have to recognize something.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:90%
It all looks like it's crazy.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Things are going out
of sync everywhere.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
We're looking as if we're
going through a random process

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%
of change here.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Things are changing here, and
things are changing there.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's not random.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an
insight of what we're in.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
It's actually called chaos.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And chaos is not random.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a very
important example.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we're in Grand
Central Station in New York

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
at rush hour, standing
on the balcony,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
watching all the people
moving in through the station,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:90%
going to their trains.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You see people going
this way and that way

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:90%
You say, wow, they're random.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I go, no, they're not random.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Every person has a specific
destination, a train

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to find.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
It's programmed.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:90%
But what is random?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell
you what random is.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
During that rush hour, you're
standing on that balcony,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and you start
yelling fire, fire.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll see
random, because people

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
will start running all different
directions to try to get out

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:90%
of the building at one point.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
realize not everybody

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:90%
knows where they're going.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They're bouncing
all over the place.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
That's random, no
destination in sight, OK?

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Chaos is actually a matter
of not being random at all.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It's actually controlled.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So the planet is in
a state of chaos.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.258 align:middle line:90%
Yes, look on the news.

00:22:53.258 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything is falling
apart here and there.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.633 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
oh, this is random.

00:22:56.633 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:90%
I go, it's not random.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a plan underneath
that's determined.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
There is a plan that
shows that we are not

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony
with the system

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and that we're going to have
to break the old system down

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:90%
and create a new system.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:90%
The old system has structure.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:90%
The new system has structure.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But what's in the middle
as one is breaking down

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and a new one is forming?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, it would look like chaos.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
cells are randomly

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
running all over the place
and forming a new organism.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%
And the fact is this.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They're very specifically
forming a new structure

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
as the old one is coming down.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:84%
To give you the best example
of this, consider this.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:84%
A caterpillar, a very
voracious organism,

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
will eat up all of the leaves on
the plant that it's growing on.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And once it destroys
its own environment,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
it goes into what is
called a pupa, a chrysalis.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that chrysalis,
it's the beginning

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of the formation of a
transformation from caterpillar

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:90%
to butterfly.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:90%
A caterpillar has structure.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:90%
A butterfly has structure.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you cut open a
pupa, what would you see?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:90%
A random mass of cells.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:90%
At least, it appears random.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.040 align:middle line:90%
But it is not.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Some cells are breaking down
from the old caterpillar

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
structure, and some cells are
building up the new butterfly

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle, in
that pupa, is chaos.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:84%
This is very relevant to today's
world for a simple reason.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Today's civilization is like
the voracious caterpillar.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:33.088 align:middle line:84%
It's been destroying the
environment in which we live.

00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And in this process,
we're pushing it

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to the edge, which
is causing what?

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:90%
A time for transformation.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to move
from the caterpillar

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
stage of human civilization
into the lighter

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
touch of the butterfly
stage of human civilization.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are we?

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We're not in the
butterfly phase yet,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're still following the
collapse of the caterpillar

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:90%
stage.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It is in a state
of chaos, moving

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
from a non-sustainable
civilization into one

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can thrive
into the future with.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The important point about
this is, when you look out

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the window, and you see
the chaos in the world,

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and you read the
news, and you see

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
things collapsing all over the
place, this is not a bad sign.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important positive sign.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Simple reason-- we cannot
sustain ourselves with the old

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
way of life, that we have to
transform and create a new,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:90%
sustainable civilization.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
world and it's chaos,

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a
very positive sign.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Honor it.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome it.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the process
that will allow

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
us to create that more
sustainable civilization that

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to move into the
future and thrive on a planet

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:90%
that we can love.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've given you the
insight on the world situation,

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
how does this help us move
through today's chaos?

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, coming episodes will
emphasize a renaissance

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:84%
in science that reveals a
path toward personal self

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
empowerment and an opportunity
to create a civilization that

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:90%
will thrive into the future.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.
