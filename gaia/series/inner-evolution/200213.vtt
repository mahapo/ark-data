>> Newtonian physicists
emphasize that a body made out

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.840 align:middle line:84%
of matter can only respond
to material chemical signals,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.580 align:middle line:90%
such as drugs.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, quantum
physics acknowledges

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that energy signals
are profoundly more

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:84%
effective in
controlling changes that

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:90%
create biological behavior.

What does it mean to say that
genes are not self-actualizing?

Lipton, for this series

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.145 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
genes for a second.

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Genes are not
self-actualizing, meaning

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
they're not capable of
controlling their own activity.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
life works, I'm

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
going to take you
back over 50 years ago

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing experiments
on cloning stem cells in 1967.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Firstly, what is a stem cell?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's recognize
a simple fact.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
A human body is made out
of 50 trillion cells.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:84%
During embryology,
the embryo cells

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
differentiate and create all
the structures and organs

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:84%
of our body, however,
on a day by day basis,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
we're losing up to hundreds
of billions of cells,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:90%
normal aging, normal attrition.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
every day, if you're

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
losing that many cells,
how many days can you live?

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, with
stem cells, you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
can keep going day after day,
because the cells you lose

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
are replaced by stem cells.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Stem cells are actually
just embryonic cells.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what
we call them the moment

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:90%
before you were born.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But the moment
after you're born,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that same embryonic cell is
now called a stem cell simply

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because you're no
longer an embryo.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
So I'm growing
stem cells and I'm

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
cloning them, which means I
simply put one cell in a Petri

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
dish all by itself and it
divides every 10 or 12 hours.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So first, there's
one cell, and then

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
10 hours later, two,
10 hours later, four,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps doubling,
8, 16, 32 cells.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
After a week, I have 30,000
cells in the Petri dish.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
fact is this,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
all cells came from
one parent cell.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Significance is I have 30,000
genetically identical cells

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
in my Petri dish.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the experiment
is cool, because what

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I did is I split the
30,000 cells into three

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:90%
different Petri dishes.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
All dishes have genetically
identical cells,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
but what is different is
this, I feed each culture dish

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:90%
a different culture medium.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Culture medium?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Culture medium is the
laboratory equivalent of blood.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what cells
normally live in.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So I create culture
medium to try

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to match the
composition of blood.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, since I'm in the lab
and creating that medium,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I can also change some
of that composition.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is exactly what
I did in the experiment.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I created three different
versions of culture medium

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
by slightly changing the
chemistry of the culture

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
In environment A with
culture medium A,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
the cells formed muscle.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
In culture B with environment
B, the cells formed bone.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the third dish,
in environment C,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:90%
the cells form fat cells.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the results, a
profound question arises, what

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:90%
controls the fate of the cells?

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Most important point
is this, all the cells

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
are genetically identical.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
was the composition

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of the culture medium, the
environment in which the cells

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
lived, and this led me
to a whole new track

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Because recognize this,
at the very same time,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching medical
students the concept

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of genetic
determinism, that genes

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
turn on and off,
and in the process,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
control the character
of our biology.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in the
laboratory, genes

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
do not turn on and
off by themselves.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Genes are not, in this
case, self-actualizing.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
a simple mechanism.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I say simple,
because nature is simple.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
It's humans that make
complexity out of it.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:10%
To understand a
simple mechanism,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:10%
I create a model with gears and
a motor, switch and a gauge,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:10%
and the gears represent
the mechanisms

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:10%
that carry out a function.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:10%
The motor is a drive force
that causes the gears to move.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:10%
The switch, of course, turns
the mechanism on and off,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:10%
and the gauges feedback how
is the mechanism running,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:10%
very similar to
the gauges you have

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:10%
on the dashboard of your car to
see how your car is performing.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
these basic subunits,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I can explain biology to
you using this simple model.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So to start with, let's talk
about the mechanism, the gears.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The gears are what
carry out the function.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, in biology, the
gears are proteins.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:10%
And there are over 100,000
different proteins,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:10%
each with their own
unique shape, that

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:10%
comprise the structure of the
cells and of the human body.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:10%
And then the analogy,
to make it very simple,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:10%
is consider this, a Lego
protein molecule kit,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:10%
100,000 different
parts, it's how

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:10%
you assemble the parts that
create the different versions

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:10%
of cells.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So a skin cell uses
some of these proteins,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
a muscle cell uses
some other proteins,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
a nerve cell uses some
of those proteins,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:90%
plus additional proteins.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
All cells are assembled out
of molecular building blocks

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
called proteins,
and that's where

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the structure of those cells
in the body comes from.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:10%
But here's an interesting
point, proteins are actually

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:10%
linear strings of
amino acids, something

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:10%
like a string of pearls,
where each pearl represents

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:10%
a different amino acid.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:10%
There are 20
different amino acids,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:10%
so you can string these pearls
together and create a string

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:10%
with thousands of
amino acid beads.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And this creates a
protein filament,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
so a protein filament
is a linear string.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you look
at the human body

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.663 align:middle line:84%
with its all its
three-dimensional structure

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and I say, well, if
proteins are strings,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
why don't we look like a
bowl full of spaghetti?

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is profoundly
important for this reason.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Each different type of
amino acids out of the 20

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that are found in humans
have a different shape,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and they also have different
charges, electrical charges.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
soluble in water,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and some are soluble in oil.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:10%
So the significance
is this, when

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:10%
you make a string
of protein, which

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:10%
is a string of amino acids,
it starts out as a string,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:10%
but if you look at that
string and recognize

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:10%
a very simple fact, if some of
those amino acids are positive

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:10%
and others are negative, what
would happen to that string?

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is this,
positive attracts negative.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, the
string will fold on itself

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to balance the charges.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is the
foundation of understanding

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
how a linear string
peptide actually forms

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
a three-dimensional molecule.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
To show you that,
here is actually

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
an image of a peptide string
that has just been synthesized.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a linear string.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
All over the surface
of that string where

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the amino acids are, there
are different charges,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative charges.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Two light charges, when
they come together,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:90%
repel each other.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But two opposite charges,
when they come together,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
attract each other.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh, then what's
the relevance of this?

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I say, once the protein string
is made, in 1/1000 of a second,

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that string will self-knit into
a three-dimensional structure

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
by balancing the positive
and negative charges

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
along the string.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Nature has created
self-knitting yarn.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
A protein is created
as a filament,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and once its synthesized,
it will self-knit

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:90%
into a three-dimensional shape.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have an insight
into the secret of life.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the secret of life
isn't that profound,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
that light should come in
here from the heavens above.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The secret of life
is profoundly simple.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Recognize this, each protein
has a three-dimensional shape

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the
electrical charges

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that are being balanced along
the filament that ultimately

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
cause the filament to knit into
that three-dimensional shape.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, so what?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.987 align:middle line:10%
I say, ah, but proteins can
bind to environmental signals.

00:09:02.987 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well,
what does that mean?

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, when a signal that
is complementary to a protein

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:10%
shows up in the
environment, that

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:10%
signal binds to the protein.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
But if the signal
has a charge, then it

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
changes the charge
on the protein.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I go, yeah, but
what's the relevance?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, the protein
shape is based

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:90%
on the distribution of charges.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:10%
So if the protein
changes its charge,

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:10%
guess what, it re-knits.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:10%
And when that signal
binds to the protein,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:10%
causes the protein to change
from its original shape

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.715 align:middle line:10%
and create a second
confirmation or shape.

00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You go, wow, that's
really pretty neat.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, you see, here's
the important part.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the movement
of the protein

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that is utilized by the cell
to carry out work or functions.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, movement creates behavior.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, basically, then
the body is made out

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of structural proteins
that give us our shape,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
but guess what,
these proteins can

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
change their shape, and
in the process, move,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and when they move, they
cause work to occur.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:10%
To illustrate how proteins
work and how they function,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to show
you a manufacturing

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:10%
plant of an automobile.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, in this plant, there
are these giant red machines

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:10%
that you see.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:10%
The red machines, like proteins,
have very specific shape

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:10%
movements.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:10%
A protein moves this way, the
protein machine moves this way,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:10%
and if you line them up
and then activate them,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:10%
look what they do.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:90%
They create a car.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Guess what, there are no
people in this picture.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole car's being assembled
by these red machines, each

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:90%
with very precise movements.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Line them up into an assembly
line and they create the car.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.748 align:middle line:84%
Well, on the nano scale,
the proteins in your body

00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
are functionally equivalent
to the red machines we just

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:90%
saw building a car.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And assemblies of proteins,
which are called pathways,

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
actually act in assembling
the structures that

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
create the body,
and move the body,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and help all the body functions.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So the body structure
is provided by proteins,

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
but the function
of the body is also

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
provided by proteins, proteins
responding to signals, changing

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
their shape, and the resulting
movement used to carry out

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:90%
all the functions of life.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:90%
So now we have an understanding.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
The structure of the
body is made by proteins,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
but a force causes
these proteins to move,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and this force comes from
environmental signals.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So when we want to say,
how does life work,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
we make a very simple
equation, proteins

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
plus environmental
signals equal behavior.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.620 align:middle line:90%
That's how life works.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of signals are
controlling our proteins?

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, as previously mentioned,
in a Newtonian world,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics said proteins
are made out of matter.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They can only be affected
by other forms of matter,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
hence, the
pharmaceutical company.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:90%
What are they making?

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Drugs.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but what are drugs?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Signals, signals to
control your biology.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So if your biology isn't working
correctly, taking a drug in

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
can create the action
that should return health

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
back to normal again.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
However, in 1925, quantum
physics came into our world,

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and quantum physics
said the material world

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive is
actually an illusion,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that the whole universe is not
split into matter and energy,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe is actually
just made out of energy.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So how can we understand that
when you look at the world

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and you see all
the physical things

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and you can push on
things and feel things,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and then we find out all those
things aren't matter at all,

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
they're all energy, how does
that make any sense, especially

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
in a Newtonian
materialistic science world?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is this.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
when we look at what
are called atoms,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
there was a philosopher
by the name of Democritus,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and what did he show?

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
He said that the smallest parts
of the universe are uncuttable.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, uncuttable is atom,
so the name atom means that this

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
structure cannot be reduced
any further than it is,

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the smallest particle
of the universe.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So atoms come in different
varieties, and sort

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
of like recipes, you can
add atoms and mix them

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
in different ways and
create different things.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So our perception of an atom
is small little physical

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
particles, but in 1895,
physicists said, wait,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
there's something
inside those atoms.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And they looked inside
and what do they find?

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they found there were
smaller things called electrons

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.998 align:middle line:90%
and protons and neutrons.

00:13:57.998 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, they
were saying, oh my god,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:10%
so there's smaller particles.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, that was
valid until about 1915,

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and around that time, physicists
had a different perception.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, what
are those smaller particles

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:90%
made out of?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:90%
What's an electron made out of?

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What's a proton made out of?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
They found that they were made
out of energy vortices, nano

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
tornadoes.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
When they looked inside
the atom, guess what?

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
There was no matter in it.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So in 1925, when quantum
physics was established,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
our vision of a
Newtonian material world

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
only was now challenged,
because now, we

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:90%
live in an energy world.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything is made
out of energy.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, well,
how can you see

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
something that's
made out of energy,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because a characteristic of
energy is it's invisible.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm made out of
energy, how can you see me?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, interesting enough,
it's a trick of the light.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, light ends
photons from its source,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and when the photon
hits the energy field,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
it's reflected back so you
see the reflection of light.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:90%
What's really important?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't see me in
the dark, and when

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you do see me in the light,
you're not really seeing me.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing are photons
of light being reflected off

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%
of my surface.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Underneath, just energy.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.215 align:middle line:90%
Nothing physical at all.

00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, why is
this really relevant?

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, because then,
it opens up to the fact

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that what we perceive as
matter is not only influenced

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
by other forms of matter,
but because matter is energy,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
it's also influenced by all
the energy fields around us.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, this
says that the signals that

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
drive life don't have
to be chemical drugs,

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, what
we understand now

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is that the signals
as energy signals

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
are much more
efficient and much more

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
effective in controlling
protein changes

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:90%
than are physical drugs.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Relevance is this, what sources
of energy do we know affect us?

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, there's outside
energies in the environment

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:90%
that we live.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But more important is
this, consciousness

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:90%
is an energy field.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness isn't
physical matter,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
it is a consequence of
the action of nerve cells

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
manifesting an energy field.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And I say, why is that relevant?

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out
that consciousness

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most vital
sources of controlling protein

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
behavior, that our
consciousness, our attitudes,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, and emotions
are not just random

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
experiences, but they actually
can impact the movement

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:90%
and operation of our proteins.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes
profoundly important,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because it says our thoughts
are not just random,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
but our thoughts are influential
in altering the proteins

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in our body, which in turn
provide for our behavior,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
and as we'll talk about
later in epigenetics,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
actually are involved with
controlling gene expression.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And this changes the name of
the game, because no longer are

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
we victims of a material world,
because now, we recognize

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness controls
our biology and the character

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
To get an idea of
energy and atoms

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and how our thoughts
affect us, let's look

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
at a model of an atom.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:90%
What's the charge on an atom?

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
0, equal positive
and equal negative.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at the
distribution of the charges,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
with the electrons
being negative

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and the protons
being positive, here

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in our model, what we
can see is the electrons

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
in this particular atom
are not evenly balanced.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
There is an electron on
the right side of the atom,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and not one on the
left side of the atom.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The relevance is very clear that
the charges, although equal,

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.292 align:middle line:90%
are not equally balanced.

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So you say, so what
does that mean?

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.963 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, if you bring a
volt meter up to this atom

00:18:10.963 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:10%
and bring it on the right
side, the volt meter

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:10%
will read negative.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:10%
If you move the volt meter
toward the positive side,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.593 align:middle line:10%
the volt meter is in the middle,
but if you move the volt meter

00:18:20.593 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:10%
up towards the positive
side, of course,

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:10%
then the volt meter
reads positive.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:10%
I go, wow, great.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:10%
I can see the charge
differences as I move

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.805 align:middle line:10%
the volt meter around the atom.

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:10%
Ah, but here's an
interesting story.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Atoms spin, just like tornadoes.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Point, I don't have to
move the volt meter.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is hold
the volt meter still

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:90%
and let the atom spin.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So in our model right
here, the atom is spinning.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
One side is more negative
than the other side,

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.297 align:middle line:84%
so one side is
blue in the picture

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and the other side is red.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They balance, so no net charge,
but when the volt meter is on,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:84%
we can see as it spins
around, the volt meter

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
goes from positive to
negative, positive to negative.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.005 align:middle line:90%
I say, let's get a printout.

00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we get a printout
of that volt meter

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
reading, what do we see?

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Waves.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what,
this is exactly

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
the characteristic of energy.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Energy are invisible waves of
positive and negative charges

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:90%
moving through space.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
An atom is a generator
of electrical waves,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
because as it spins, the
differences in charges

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
around the atom are reflected as
the ripples that are emanating

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:90%
from that atom as it spins.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So the significance
is this, we've

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
gotten used to seeing atoms
as physical particles.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.642 align:middle line:90%
That's an illusion.

00:19:37.642 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The physical realm that we
see is really an illusion.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Albert Einstein had
a very interesting quote.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, reality is
merely an illusion,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:90%
albeit a very persistent one.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
The point is, what we see as the
material world is not material

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
that the atom is energy,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
then our vision of an atom
as a physical particle

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:90%
must be changed.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Atoms are actually like droplets
that hit the water and cause

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.800 align:middle line:90%
ripples around them.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll consider the
droplet as the atom,

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and the ripples surrounding
it are the energy spinning off

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:90%
like a tornado.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a
sudden, it says then

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:90%
atoms are giving off energy.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
All things are
giving off energy.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Relevance?

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
All things made out of
energy are interconnected,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
because energy doesn't
have borders like we

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
perceive in the physical realm.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Energies propagate
at long distances.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So you see me as this
physical structure here,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
but if you could see
my energy profile,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
there'll be waves of energy
radiating off, and guess what,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
interfering or interacting
with other energy.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The point is simply this,
in a material experience

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of the world, we see objects
as separate and distinct

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But in a quantum
physics understanding,

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:84%
everything is energy and
everything is interconnected.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
The universe is not made out of
two things, matter and energy,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a singularity.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Now comes a very
interesting component.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We are radiating energy
and we're absorbing energy.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when you look at
the periodic table of elements,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
what we also note is there's
something called the absorption

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
spectrum, and it says
that every element,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.060 align:middle line:84%
every atom of a
different type has

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:90%
a unique vibrational frequency.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, energies
interact with each other.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, if raindrops
are falling on a pond,

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and all the ripples are
forming from each raindrop,

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the ripples merge and
connect with each other

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and alter each other.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So energy doesn't just pass
through one form of energy

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
to another, energies can
interact with each other.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And to illustrate that, I want
to talk about interference.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's say two atoms exist.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Our conventional understanding
is that these atoms

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
are physical particles.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
In a Newtonian expression,
when those atoms come together,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
boom, they create
chemistry, and that's

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:90%
what we see in the world.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's an illusion,
illusion of light.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the atoms aren't
physical, they're energy waves.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And the question is this,
then what's interacting?

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Nothing physical.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Atoms interact because they're
energy waves interacting

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And this changes our whole
understanding of the world,

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
physical on physical,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
it's energy connected
to everything.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to give
a very important insight

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
into the nature
of our vibrations.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Each human is made out
of atoms and molecules,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
each human is vibrating
energy just like an atom,

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:90%
radiating away.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Consider this simple experiment.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I take two rocks, exactly the
same size, exact same height

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
above the water, drop
them in the water exactly

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:90%
the same time.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The result is the ripples
in the water, which

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.675 align:middle line:84%
represent the energy, are
coming toward each other.

00:22:57.675 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, what happens

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:90%
when two sets of ripples meet?

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:10%
That's called interference.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, what happens when
two energies come together?

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can show
you schematically.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So in my picture right
here, what you see

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
are the ripples on the
surface of the pond.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the net result
of the interaction?

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:10%
The answer is simple, add
up the values of the waves.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And as you look at this and you
see the overlap, both of them

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:10%
have the same high peak and
both have the same low valley.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you could see
is this, they add up.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the high ripple
is not plus 1,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
it's plus 2, because you
add both ripples together.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And the valley is minus 2,
so when the two small ripples

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
come together, guess
what they create?

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:90%
A larger ripple.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The height of the
ripple is larger

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:84%
because you're adding
the value of each wave.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I go, what does it mean
if the ripple is larger?

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It means there's more power.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Simple point.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Drop a little rock into the
pond, you get a little ripple.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Drop a big rock in the
pond, you get a big wave.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:10%
The point is, the height of the
ripple or the wave is power.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:10%
This is called
constructive interference

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:10%
because the two
energy waves are more

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:10%
powerful than either source
waves when they come together.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, that sounds complicated.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, it does sound
complicated, but guess what,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
all of you have
experienced this process

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
where energy that was in harmony
with you has connected with you

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
and you raised your energy,
but we called it good vibes.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Good vibes is a reflection.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
You got more energy.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I say, where'd you get it?

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you're interacting
with other energy

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:90%
that's in harmony with you.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:84%
What if the ripples
are not in alignment,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:84%
so that I have the two
rocks, I drop them,

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I drop one rock before
I drop the other rock,

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and the point is this, as
this ripple is going up,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.563 align:middle line:90%
this ripple is going down.

00:24:46.563 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
When this ripple is going
down, this one's going up.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:90%
They're out of phase.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens when two out of
phase ripples come together?

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I show them overlapping.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The height of one is plus 1, the
depth of the other is minus 1.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I say add them up.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Plus 1, minus 1, 0.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Minus 1, plus 1, 0.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, the
line flattens out.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:90%
No energy at all.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So two energies can
cancel each other.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, that's
interference.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not constructive,
it's destructive.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, you've
experienced that as well.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:19.742 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:25:19.742 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
feel bad vibes.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Bad vibes are information.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:90%
What are they telling you?

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the
environment you're in

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:84%
is canceling the
energy of your body.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Life is energy.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
If life gets canceled because
the energy is canceled,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So guess what, good vibes, when
we're enhancing our energy,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
tell us this is a good
place for us to go.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Bad vibes are information.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They're telling you wherever you
are, this is not safe for you

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because your energy
is being canceled.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Humans use language.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
All the other organisms
on this planet

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have a
particular language,

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:90%
they just read the energy.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
An organism will move
toward any direction

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
where their energy is
enhanced, because that

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.023 align:middle line:90%
enhances their life.

00:26:08.023 --> 00:26:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And if they move in
a direction and they

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.357 align:middle line:84%
feel their energy being canceled
by destructive interference,

00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
what do you think they do?

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
They turn around and
go the other way.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And the point is
this, all organisms,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and that includes humans, the
primary means of communication

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is to read the energy fields,
because energy is life.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And if your field goes up,
you're going to enhance life.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
If your field goes down,
your life is threatened.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most of us
have been programmed

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
not to go by our feelings
but to actually listen

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:90%
to what the person is saying.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I go, that's the first big
mistake on this planet,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because anybody can say
any words they want.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Positive words,
they can make you

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're going
to be a millionaire,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're ripping you off.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The most important aspect
of making any relationship,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it's with people
or objects or anything

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
in your world, is
to feel the vibes.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is profoundly important
as a compass to tell you

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
where you should
be in your life,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
always moving toward positive
vibes, good vibes, higher

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:90%
energy, more life.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Let me bring Albert
Einstein into the story,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
because this quote is
most profoundly important.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
"The field is the sole governing
agency of the particle."

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:90%
The particle is matter.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein is
saying, the energy field

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:84%
is the sole governing agency
of our physical expression.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:10%
And this is why
it's so important

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:10%
to understand the nature
of the energy field,

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:10%
because it's the
energy that determines

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:10%
the nature of who we are.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Field simply means
invisible moving forces that

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:90%
influence the physical world.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That's really
pretty interesting,

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.075 align:middle line:84%
because there's
another word that

00:27:58.075 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
has exactly the same
definition, spirit.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
When quantum physics was
introduced into the world,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
it introduced the
nature of spirituality

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a field, it
introduced the nature of us

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
as energy beings affecting
the energy around us

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.663 align:middle line:84%
and being affected by
that energy around us.

00:28:23.663 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we
understand this and we

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
start to pay attention to
those invisible energies, which

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
include consciousness,
then we're

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
beginning to understand
why our lives come out

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the way they come
out, because it's

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the invisible energy that
ultimately shapes our life

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.850 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's review the
fundamental understanding

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
of what is happening
in our bodies.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The mechanism that
provides for life

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is based on the structure
and the function

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:90%
of protein molecules.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
The assembly of proteins creates
our structure, our anatomy.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
The movement of proteins is
due to confirmational changes

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in the backbone of the
protein in response

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.710 align:middle line:90%
to environmental signals.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
In contrast to the
conventional perspective

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that life controlling signals
are represented by chemistry

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
or drugs, quantum
physics reveals

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that the most potent controlling
signals are represented

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:90%
by invisible energy fields.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Examples of
life-controlling signals

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:84%
include consciousness
and spirituality.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
The next episode will
illuminate the mechanism

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
by which these energy
fields interact

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the good
and bad vibes that shape

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
the character of our lives.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on inner evolution

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:90%
through biological change.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:90%
