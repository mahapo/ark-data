00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:10%
In previous episodes, we learned
that the mind represented

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:10%
the interface between
the environment

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:10%
and the control of our biology.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:10%
Described as science fiction,
the movie, "The Matrix",

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:10%
is more accurately
a documentary,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:10%
for we have all been programmed.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:10%
The movie's proverbial red
pill offered individuals

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:10%
an opportunity to escape
their programming.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Many have actually experienced
the equivalent of that pill

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.470 align:middle line:84%
when they manifested Heaven on
Earth, The Honeymoon Effect,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:90%

This session focuses
on the mechanism

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
by which the mind shapes
our outer life experiences,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
effectively use the mind

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
to create a happy,
healthy harmonious life.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
In previous episodes,
what we discussed

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
our beliefs control

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
the character of our lives.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
our beliefs

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
are primarily programmed
during the first seven

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
years of our
development, and that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
these developmental programs
actually run 95% of our life.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, the question is,
how do we control this,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
or can we control this to
create the life we want,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
not the one we've been
programmed to experience?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Well to understand
this, let's start off

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
with a very simple
fact, the mind

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is interpreting the
environment in which we live,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and the mind creates
behavior to complement

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:90%
those environmental signals.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
interpretation of the world.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
action of the mind,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
there is a mechanism
in medical science

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.486 align:middle line:90%
called electroencephalograph.

00:02:13.486 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
The electroencephalograph is a
mechanism where you put wires

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:84%
on a person's
head, and you could

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:90%
read their brain activity.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:90%
The reason is very simple.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts of an
individual brain

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
are manifest through
electrical activity.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
This electrical activity is then
conducted up through the skin,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and the EEG wires are actually
receiving those signals

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.856 align:middle line:84%
and interpreting
our brains function.

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
The electroencephalograph is
reading an internal expression

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
That this internal
consciousness is then

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
responsible for releasing
neurochemicals, and hormones,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and emotional chemicals
that ultimately

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:90%
control our behavior.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So the conventional
belief is our mind

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:90%
is contained within our head.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts are exclusive
to us only and not available

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
to the outside world.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a newer technology

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
in reading the
function of the mind,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and that newer technology is
called magnetoencephalograph.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it does the
same kind of thing.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It reads the electrical
activity of the brain,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and then reveals the
functioning of the mind.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But here is an
important difference

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
between magnetoencephalograph
and electroencephalograph.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And the differences
is this, the EEG

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
has wires directly
touching our skin

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're reading the
conduction of brain activity

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
up to the skin.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
However, magnetoencephalograph
uses a probe

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:90%
that is outside of your head.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even touch your body.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what's
the significance?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading your brain
activity outside.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So your thoughts are not
contained in your head.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are broadcast
out into the field.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, then all of
a sudden it says

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that your thoughts are creating
an environment of energy

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're
broadcasting to interact

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of
the surrounding world.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, what influence
will that have?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, to get an
idea, let's go back

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to an earlier
understanding, and that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is when two energies that
are in harmony come together

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and where they interfere
with each other,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
they add up the power
of their energy waves

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and make a more
powerful vibration.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is called constructive
interference or good vibes.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But it can affect
our environment

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:90%
in many different ways.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if I
have a crystal goblet,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and the atoms in this
goblet are spinning

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
at a certain vibration, and
I have a tuning fork that

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
has a pitch that is the same
vibration as the vibration

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of the atoms in the
goblet, then what

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
happens when I hit
the tuning fork

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of the goblet?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of the tuning
fork moves toward the goblet,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
the atoms in the
goblet are already

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
spinning at a certain
vibration, and where

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the
tuning fork interacts

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
with the vibration of the
atoms in the goblet, that's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
called a constructive
interference,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
it causes an amplitude
increase in the vibration,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
more powerful vibration.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the problem.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
A goblet holds its shape
because the atoms are all

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
interconnected in
such a way that they

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:90%
maintain the shape of a goblet.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But if I caused the atoms
to spin much, much faster

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
because of the tuning fork's
constructive interference

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
with the atom spin,
the atoms will

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
spin so fast that they actually
cause the goblet to explode.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
The atoms blow apart
and the goblet breaks.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is called
constructive interference.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And constructive
interference really

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
reveals how harmonic
resonance occurs.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
That means when there's
a vibration in harmony

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:84%
with something
else, then the two

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
will interact and actually cause
an increase in that vibration.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's look at
a simple experiment.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:84%
In this experiment
I have five goblets

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
with different
vibrational frequencies

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
as recognized as f as
frequency, as v, w, x, y, and z,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:90%
five different frequencies.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have a tuning fork
tuned at frequency x.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Question is, what will
happen to these goblets

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
when I hit that tuning
fork at frequency x?

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
All the other goblets that
are not at frequency x

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.344 align:middle line:84%
will not be affected
by that vibration.

00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Only goblet with
frequency x atoms

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
will respond to
that tuning fork.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, this becomes
an important insight,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
because it really reveals
that a vibration can pick out

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
something in the
environment that

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is in harmony with
that vibration,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
interfere with it in a form
of constructive interference,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and excite that object
in the environment.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of a sudden,
I go back to the story

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of magnetoencephalograph
and what

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:90%
does this really represent?

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, it represents
something very important.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is a tuning fork.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are not
contained in your head.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:84%
They're broadcast
out into the field

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
as vibrational frequencies.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what's the relevance?

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd like to show that
using this model, where

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:90%
I have four goblets.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But these are not
crystal goblets.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
These goblets represent
different characteristics

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
In goblet number
one, there there's

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
a woman arguing
with her partner.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
In goblet number two, is a
characteristic expression

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of a woman thinking,
how did I always end up

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:90%
with jerks like this?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
The third goblet is
a wonderful goblet

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:90%
showing a romantic dinner.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
goblet, is a goblet

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that shows a courtroom scene
where he said and she are

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
being broadcast to the judge.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
will only interact with
situations that are

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
in harmony with that thought.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a person
grows up in a family where

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
there was lots of arguing
between the mother and father.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
During the first seven
years of that child's life,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the child is
downloading a program

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that parents interact by
arguing with each other,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because the child
just downloading

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:90%
what they're observing.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
So if an individual came
from that foundation, then

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:84%
guess what, their thoughts
will most likely precipitate

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
an argument between
themselves and their partner,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
because this is the program
being manifest by the mind

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and becoming real.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
function of the mind

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is to create coherence between
the program and the reality.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's look at
the same situation

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:10%
and say that this
individual came

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:10%
from a happy, loving
family with a mother

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:10%
and father always shared
romance, and love,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:10%
and happiness together.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that particular
case, this individual's mind

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
will be broadcasting
a frequency that

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
interacts with the goblets
showing the couple having

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:90%
a romantic dinner.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes important
because then it says,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
are the things that happened
to me accidents in my life?

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Things came to me?

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:90%
I go, no.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
We are actually
broadcasting a vibration

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
that will manifest a physical
expression of our thoughts

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and our life experiences.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
because most of us

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
are really not aware of the
thoughts of individuals.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
However, many people can
read an individual thoughts,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
because the thoughts are
being broadcast to the field.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting is when people
live together for a long time,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
the individuals learn how to
read each other's thoughts

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:84%
without actually manifesting
a conscious expression

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:90%
of those thoughts.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you hear a
conversation between two people

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
who've been together
for a very long time,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
it may sound
something like this.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Hey, would you like to--

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I would.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
What day?

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The sentences aren't
even completed yet.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:90%
How can this happen?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to become
coherent with your partner,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:84%
you can also start to
read the vibrations that

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
are coming forth from
their consciousness,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, actually
speaking is not even necessary.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in
primitive cultures,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
most people were
communicating nonverbally

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
through thoughts being
transmitted as vibrations

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and received by
another individual.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
important understanding

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
about how the field
is actually creating

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:84%
what our life is experiencing,
and how individuals

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
can actually read those
thoughts of other people

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and understand something
that people around

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
have no vision of, because it's
interpreting the vibrations.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
In the movie, "The
Matrix", the story

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone's
been programmed,

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and that they're living their
lives through these programs.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:10%
But the protagonist in the
movie has an opportunity

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:10%
to take either a blue
pill or a red pill.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:10%
If he takes the blue
pill, when he wakes up,

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:10%
he's back into
the same old world

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:10%
with the same old expressions
that were always there.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:10%
But if he takes the red pill,
he gets out of the program.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:10%
And this becomes
profoundly important,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:10%
because, as we understand
now, 95% of our life

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:10%
is coming from the program.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we could get
out of the program,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
then we could manifest
a different character

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's like taking a red pill.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to emphasize
a very important fact.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Most of us as adults out here,
have already taken the red pill

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
with amazing results.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know we
took the pill, but we

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
did experience the results.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:84%
When we fell in love,
our life changes.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Consider this, the day before
you fell in love, blah,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, your life
was blah, blah, blah,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
for weeks and days and years.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
you meet a special person,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and just 24 hours later, your
whole world is different.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you're
so deeply in love.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
more beautiful.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Life is so much more precious.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:90%
The food's better.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:90%
The music's better.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything's better.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Even the job that wasn't
so good is better.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I go, what happened
in 24 hours to change

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
a blah, blah, blah life
into Heaven on Earth?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Every day our life is 95% coming
from the subconscious programs,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
because our conscious
mind is thinking.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:10%
When people fall in
love, they stop thinking.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:10%
They become mindful.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They stay in the present moment.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
You've waited your whole life
for this person to show up.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:90%
They show up.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the time
to be thinking.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the time to be present,
to enjoy and experience what's

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:90%
manifesting in your life.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Relevance is very important,
because the moment

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
you stop thinking, is the
moment you stop actually playing

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious programs.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
No more default to
the subconscious.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
You are now with
your conscious mind

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
controlling your
biological vehicle.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And where are you
going to drive it?

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
To wishes, and desires,
and aspirations.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is how when people fall
in love, the immediate period

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
after falling in love, is a
Heaven on Earth experience,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
a Honeymoon Effect,
because being in love

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
actually keeps your hands on the
wheel with the conscious mind,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and no defaulting
to the subconscious.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You immediately start
to manifest a life.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So The Honeymoon Effect
is profoundly important,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:90%
because what does it represent?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one, it's a
state of exuberant health.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, when people
fall in love, they

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
become healthier, more
alert, alive, and joy.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, because
the concept of love

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is translated into the chemistry
of love, as we mentioned,

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
in the form of dopamine,
and pleasure, and oxytocin,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and bonding, and growth hormone.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.597 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we have an
abundance of life energy.

00:14:30.597 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:10%
I bet you when you
first fell in love,

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:10%
you probably made love
for days without stopping

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:10%
for food or sleep.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get
all the energy from?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Because love is an
empowering force

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that gives us that energy.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
consequence of this love?

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, we began to
experience a life of Heaven

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, because, now,
we are the creators, not

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:84%
operating from
programs, but operating

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
from our wishes and our desires.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we
change our life.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of you
experience that.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
But you've also
experienced this,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
the honeymoon
doesn't seem to last.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Many people have just
a very short period.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Some people can
sustain a honeymoon

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
for weeks or months, even a year
or so, but at some point life

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
returns back to the life that
it was before you fell in love.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, what happened?

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that honeymoon?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And here's the answer.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're in love, you keep
the conscious mind present,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're creating
your life with it.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.885 align:middle line:90%
However, life gets busy.

00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
you're going to have

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:90%
to start thinking about what?

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Whatever your job is?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Whatever your chores are?

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your
responsibilities are?

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the moment you start
thinking, is the moment, now,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
your life is controlled by
default, by the subconscious

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:90%
mind programs.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I say, so why is this cause
a problem in The Honeymoon?

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
profoundly simple.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
During that time
period, neither partner

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
sees the other person's
subconscious programs,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:90%
most of which are negative.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
However, once life
starts to get busy,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and one of the people in this
relationship starts thinking,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:90%
then, guess what?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Their behavior at this
moment is no longer

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
controlled by wishes and
desires conscious mind.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It is now being run by
subconscious programs,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and some of those negative
programs out of the 70% that

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:90%
are negative start to manifest.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Your partner all of a
sudden sees this behavior,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:90%
like, where did this come from?

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
partner is observing

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
their partner's negative
behavior, never seen

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.268 align:middle line:90%
before during The Honeymoon.

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
negative behaviors start

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to show up and your
partner looks and goes,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:84%
wow, that behavior
isn't so great.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, we have a great
relationship otherwise,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:90%
so I'll compromise.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes my
partner's like that.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll just compromise,
because most of the time

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:90%
we're having a good thing going.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say, my
partner and I are

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:90%
having a wonderful honeymoon.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And she comes up and asked
me a simple question,

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
but at this moment I'm
thinking, thinking about my job

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I have to do, she
asked me a simple question,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.672 align:middle line:84%
and I turned to her and
go, blah, blah, blah!

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:84%
My partner looks at me and
goes what kind of behavior

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is that, and all of
a sudden you have

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
behavior I just played

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
was not from my
conscious mind, it

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
was from my
subconscious program.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
My conscious mind was
even paying attention

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:90%
because it was thinking.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
right now, I'm

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
being accused of having some
bad program by my partner.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, I don't know
what you're talking about,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because, basically,
I didn't even

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
see the behavior that she saw.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's an
argument, because I'm

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
going to deny I'm that person
that just did that behavior.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
She's going to recognize
I just did that behavior.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, an argument
starts, and that

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of a
breakdown of the relationship.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's really due to
the fact that my behavior

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:84%
from my subconscious
was invisible to me.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
She saw it.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So the significance about
this is, when we're in love,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and we stay in the
conscious mind,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the equivalent of
taking the red pill.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
take the red pill,

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
you're out of the program.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, the issue is this, OK,
I've got some bad programs.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see them, but
my partner sure did.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we end up
in arguments, that

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
will actually stress the
bonds of our relationship

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and could cause it to break.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
But consider this
other possibility.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
If both partners are aware that
subconscious programs manifest

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
themselves, but they don't
represent who we are,

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
they just represent the download
that we got, instead of, oh,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:90%
that was lousy what you did.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Goes like, did you hear
what you just said,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
or did you understand
what you just said?

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
This gives us an
opportunity to have

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:90%
a dialogue and a discussion.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, what we can do
is find out, oh my God, I

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
have this bad program that
I acquired from my father

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
during the first seven years.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I understand I
have this bad program.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is this,
how can I change the program?

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Well this is where the biggest
problems in relationships

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:90%
come from.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
How can you get out of the
limitations of programs

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that where you downloaded
from other people that

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:90%
are disempowering?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, there
are four fundamental ways

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that you can change
subconscious programming.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:10%
Three of these ways,
you can control.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:10%
One of them, actually,
you have no control over.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, you have a
major life experience.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
You go to the doctor,
and the doctor

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
tells you, oh my God,
you have terminal cancer.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:90%
You're going to die.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.457 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a
shock to the system.

00:19:54.457 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two
ways you can respond.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:90%
You can go, oh, yes, doctor.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, I will prepare to
handle all my details,

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
because I'm going to die.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Or, and this is the cool part,
a person would say, oh my God,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.045 align:middle line:84%
my life has been so rough,
and so much stress on it,

00:20:11.045 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
if I only have a
short time left,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave all
these stresses behind.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And what do they do?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
They go out and they start
enjoying their lives.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
They leave behind
all the stresses

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that were causing the
disempowerment that they

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
were experiencing.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And guess what, they go beyond
the time they were supposed

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to die, because when they
changed their consciousness,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
they empowered themselves with
a new understanding of life,

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
one in harmony, one in love,
one in pleasure and enjoyment.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a
very important fact.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
There is an entity in
the conscious mind.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious mind is
a record playback mechanism,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.282 align:middle line:90%
something like a CD player.

00:20:53.282 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say you
have a CD playing it,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and you don't like the program.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.107 align:middle line:84%
And you go up to
the player go, I

00:20:58.107 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:90%
don't want to play this anymore.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.357 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do a
different program on there.

00:21:01.357 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Don't play this anymore.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
How much talking
to the CD player

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
will it take before
that program changes?

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, you could talk
until you're blue in the face.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.573 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody in
there to hear that.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just going
to play a program.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it becomes
so disempowering for us,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
because we make a big effort to
try to change our subconscious

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
programs by talking
to ourselves,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't work because
nobody in the subconscious

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:90%
is there.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:90%
So nobody's listening.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So how are you going to
change the subconscious?

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
There are three
fundamental ways you

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
can control the subconscious.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Number one, is hypnosis.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Yes, remember the
first seven years

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:10%
of your developmental
programming

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:10%
where you downloaded
those negative programs,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:10%
you were in a state
of mind called theta.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:10%
And theta is hypnosis.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you heard from your
parents, family, and community

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
about you and your
life, you downloaded

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:90%
whatever they just said.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:90%
It was recorded.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to change a
program, you can use hypnosis.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I go, does that mean you
have to see a hypnotherapist?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, actually
you don't have to.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is the following.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Is identify the programs that
are limiting and disempowering

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, listen, I got these
programs before age seven,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and many of them in utero,
and age 0, age one, age two,

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I have no consciousness of what
the heck those programs are.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So let me help you
first with this.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Your life is a printout of
your subconscious programs.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you like that
comes into your life,

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
comes in because you have a
program to acknowledge that.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you desire or
wish for, and you want,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
work hard for it,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to struggle over it,
you have to sweat over it,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to put a lot of effort
in to making this thing happen,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.678 align:middle line:84%
whatever program you got doesn't
support that destination.

00:23:00.678 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I said,
well, what can I do?

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, there are these
self-help programs where

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:90%
self-hypnosis programs.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
I say, what are they?

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
You put on a pair of earphones
at night when you go to bed.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
As alpha goes slower vibration,
it enters into theta.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
consciousness is disconnected.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:90%
You've just fallen asleep.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The brain is now
operating in theta.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
the original state

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that you downloaded
programs in the first place.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you put earphones
on, and are listening

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to a program of empowerment,
after you fall asleep,

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:90%
you don't hear the program.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
hears the program.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And by repeating these
programs every night

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:84%
for a number of
nights, guess what?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
One day you'll wake up
and your subconscious mind

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
would have downloaded these
programs through the process

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
of habituation.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the ways the
subconscious mind learns.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:90%
So, OK, self-hypnosis.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Second way, how did you
learn after age seven,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
because before age
seven you were in theta

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and were downloading
through hypnosis.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But after age seven, now
you're in consciousness.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how to learn
programs after age seven?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
habituation, repetition.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
You repeated something.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:90%
You practice it.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:90%
You want to play an instrument?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in your hands.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't play it
until you do what?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Practice, practice,
practice, practice.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Habituation.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.540 align:middle line:90%
You are learning by repeating.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a point
where, guess what?

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
practice anymore.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You can pick up the
instruments and play it.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Driving, same thing.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning,
your attention

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
was all the details of
driving, all in the details,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the mirrors, the windows,
the gauges on the dashboard,

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in the
world outside of the car.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You had to pay
attention to all these.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:90%
But, guess what?

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.087 align:middle line:90%
Practice, practice, practice.

00:24:57.087 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And now you can drive a car
without paying any attention

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.407 align:middle line:84%
You can put the key in
the car, start driving,

00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and start thinking about
where you're going to go,

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to do, and not
even pay attention to the road.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because subconscious has
downloaded how to drive a car.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It is now a habit.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So you want to change a
program, start a new habit.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Fake it till you make it.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.725 align:middle line:84%
Example, you're
not a happy person,

00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:84%
so I say, what do
you want to do?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to be happy.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
All day long, in spite
of whatever unhappiness

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or experience, you say
to yourself, I am happy,

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I am happy, I am happy.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean it doesn't conform to
the world you're experiencing,

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:90%
but here's the important part.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Repeating it, and repeating it.

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
That is how the
subconscious mind learns

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:90%
after age seven, repetition.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Create a new behavior and
repeat it and repeat it.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It will automatically become
a subconscious program.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And the last method of changing
program is something brand new.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
There is an old
saying, necessity

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:90%
is the mother of invention.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we're facing the
sixth mass extinction of life

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
due to human
behavior, guess what?

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a necessity to
change our behavior.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And out of that necessity
has arisen a new modality

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:90%
of rewriting programs.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
This is referred to
as energy psychology.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:84%
These are a number of
modalities, that many of them

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
engage what is called
super learning.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.847 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll give you
an example of it.

00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
anybody read a book

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.410 align:middle line:84%
by moving their
finger down the page?

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.420 align:middle line:84%
As fast as they move their
finger down the page,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
they read every
word on the page.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
They can stand in a
bookstore and turn the pages,

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and do this, and read an
entire book in five minutes.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
That's an example
of super learning.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Once you identify what
program you want to change,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
you create a positive present
tense solution for that problem

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.320 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're not healthy,
you say, I am healthy.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And make that a program.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:90%
What's the function of the mind?

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:04.570 align:middle line:84%
To create coherence between
the program and reality.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you really want some
insight into this, my website

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
simple, brucelipton.com,
under Resources,

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
there are 25 or 30 different
energy psychology modalities

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:84%
so you can look up and find
one that feels good to you

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and try it out, because
this is the opportunity

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to take power back
over your life,

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
because your consciousness
is controlling it,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and if you can program your
subconscious with your wishes

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and desires, there's an
immediate and wonderful

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:90%
consequence.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, now that we
have an understanding of how

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram our
subconscious mind,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:84%
we now have the opportunity
to create the life we desire.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
By understanding how our
consciousness creates

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
a honeymoon, we are
offered an opportunity

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to manifest Heaven
on Earth experience

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
for every day of our
long, long lives.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
While the conscious mind can
create a happy, healthy life,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
we must also recognize
that it can manifest

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:90%
any disease and even death.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
In the planet's current
health care crisis, up to 90%

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of all diseases are
attributed to stress, and not

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:90%
the action of change.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Our next session will describe
the mutually exclusive

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.770 align:middle line:84%
relationship between growth and
protection behaviors, the role

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:84%
of the HPA axis, which
represents the Hypothalamic

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Pituitary Adrenal Axis,
and undermining our health,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and the power of the
placebo on nocebo effects

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
in shaping our
health and happiness.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:90%
