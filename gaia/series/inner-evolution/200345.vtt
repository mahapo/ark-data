>> What does it mean
to be conscious,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of and respond
to one's surroundings,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.090 align:middle line:84%
a behavior that implies
the existence of a brain

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and a nervous system?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.142 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Bruce Lipton, for
this series on Inner Evolution.

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Convention holds that the
genome-containing nucleus

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
represents a cell's
brain, for it

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
was perceived that
genes turning on and off

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
would control the cell behavior.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
As described previously, genes
are not self-actualizing,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
they are simply
blueprints that are

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
read to reproduce the
proteins and the cell itself.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, the nucleus is
actually the cell's gonad.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The brain of the cell
is the cell membrane,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:84%
for it is this structure that
reads environmental signals

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and elicits the biological
responses that control

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:90%
behavior and genetic activity.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The structure and function
of the cell's membrane

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
reveals that it is an
information processor,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
a carbon-based chip, that
provides the interface

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
between the mind and the body.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:10%
The separation of the mind/body
duality is actually first

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:10%
attributed to René Descartes.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, Descartes was a
philosopher in the early ages

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:90%
of the era of modern science.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:10%
And back in 1637 in his book
on the methods of science,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:10%
he wrote this following
phrase, and it is--

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:10%
"Cogito, ergo sum."

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:10%
I think, therefore I am.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And what Descartes was
really describing in this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that knowledge,
up until this time,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
was just based on hearsay,
that there was no science

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
was actually going on.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And that René Descartes
suggested that we get rid

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
of all previous knowledge and
start to build a new knowledge

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
base based on the
method of science.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
His only truth that he could
start with is that he existed.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
His mind, I think, existed,
and the body existed.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:10%
And in creating
"Cogito, ergo sum,"

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:10%
what René Descartes was actually
saying is that mind and body

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:10%
represent separate and
distinct substances.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:10%
The mind was a
thinking substance

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:10%
with no physicality to it.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:10%
In contrast, the body
was a physical substance

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:10%
with no thinking
attributed to it.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So we separated mind
and body very early

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:90%
in the era of modern science.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this separation
continued 50 years later

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
when Isaac Newton wrote the
"Principia," the founding

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
books of what is today
called classical physics.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that physics, what Newton
did was separate mind and body

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
just like René Descartes did.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And he separated the
mind and the body

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:90%
based on a simple reality.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
According to
physics, the universe

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.405 align:middle line:84%
is comprised of two elements--
a physical, material element

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and an invisible energy,
or spiritual element.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason for
separating mind and body

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
in Newtonian physics is simple.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:90%
The body is physical.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The mind, apparently, is a
non-physical energy element.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:10%
But there was a little bit more
to that separation as well.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
At the time Newton was
creating classical physics,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
civilization was actually
being controlled by the church,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and this separation
allowed science

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to exist outside of the
realm of the church.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the whole idea
of mind comes back

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
into our reality in the
era of quantum physics.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Max Planck, in 1944, wrote, "All
matter originates and exists

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:10%
only by virtue of a force.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:10%
We must assume behind
this force the existence

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:10%
of a conscious and
intelligent Mind.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:10%
This Mind is the
matrix of all matter."

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this becomes really
important in understanding

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
the reality of our world
because the mind now

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is an energy that is
recognized by quantum physics,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and this returns mind back
into the story of science,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
so we can engage mind
with the physical realm.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This is very interesting because
Albert Einstein followed up

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
with a very important quote
that we had mentioned earlier.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That quote is, "The field
is the sole governing agency

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:90%
of the particle."

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is this relevant right now?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is this.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
The mind is an energy field.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:90%
The particle is the bodies.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So if I repeat Einstein's
quote, putting mind and body in,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
it will read as follows--

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
"The mind is the sole
governing agency of the body."

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And this statement
brings the mind back

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
into our understanding
of science

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and its role in influencing
the character of our lives.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We describe the nature
of biology using

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the model of a simple machine.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:10%
The machine consists
of a mechanism.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:10%
There is a force that
drives these protein gears,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:10%
and that was the signals
from the environment.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:10%
In our model we
also have a switch

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:10%
that turns the motor on
and off that actually

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:10%
would control behavior.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:10%
So what I'd like to
describe right now

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:10%
is the nature of that
switch, the switch that

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:10%
invites a signal
from the environment

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:10%
to control the behavior
and genetics of the cell.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to a very
simple equation about life,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and that equation is this--

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
protein plus signal
equals behavior.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, the proteins
are in the cell,

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:84%
but the signal comes
from the environment.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
For the signal to
cross into the cell,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
it has to pass through
the cell membrane,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and that's the skin of the cell.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So to understand how
signals engage biology,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
it is important for
us to understand

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the structure
of the cell membrane

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and how that structure
will facilitate

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
an environmental signal
crossing into the cell

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and controlling the
behavior of that cell.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
about a membrane is this.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:10%
It was only in the late 1940s
that biologists even recognized

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:10%
that cells had membranes.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is this.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:10%
The membrane is so thin, it
cannot be seen with a regular

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:10%
microscope.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
The membrane, to be seen, we had
to use an electron microscope,

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and that was
developed in the '40s.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
At the first time
cells were observed,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.255 align:middle line:84%
along the outer surface of the
cell was a layer, the membrane.

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
There were three
layers to the membrane

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
as seen in the electron
microscope-- dark, light, dark.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really significant
about this identity

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:90%
of the membrane is this.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
In biology, structure
relates to function.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The more complex the structure,
the more complex the function.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they looked
at the cell membrane

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
with a simple
trilaminar layer, they

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
said, well, there's not
really much structure to that,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and that all of a sudden implied
that perhaps there wasn't very

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:90%
much function to the membrane.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, scientists
perceived that the membrane

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more
than plastic wrap

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
containing the
cytoplasm of the cell.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just basically
a structure that

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:90%
holds the cytoplasm together.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was based on
the electron microscope.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
The simple trilaminar
structure of the cell membrane

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
actually reflects the
molecular organization

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that is the foundation
of this membrane.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:10%
The membrane is composed
of a bilayer of what

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.952 align:middle line:10%
are called phospholipids.

00:08:03.952 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Phospholipids are very
interesting molecules

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
because half the
molecule is hydrophilic,

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
meaning it would love to
be dissolved in water,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
but the other half of the
molecule is hydrophobic

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and avoids water.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:10%
The significance of this is that
the molecules forming the cell

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:10%
membrane create a
layered structure

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:10%
with lipid in the center.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The membrane is a barrier,
but the lipid in the center

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
resists water.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It's hydrophobic.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is, anything
from the outer environment that

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is soluble in water cannot
pass through the membrane

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
because of the lipid center
which will resist the flow

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of water molecules
going across the cell.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:90%
So the significance is this.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:10%
The membrane structure,
by definition,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:10%
is a crystalline structure
with a lipid core

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:10%
that actually makes
it a nonconductor.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Trilaminar structure
I can illustrate

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:10%
by using an analogy of a
bread and butter sandwich.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the bread on
each side would

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
represent the phosphate
groups because bread,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.615 align:middle line:84%
like phosphate groups,
can absorb water.

00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But in the center of the
bread and butter sandwich,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
the thick layer of
butter is the equivalent

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of the lipids in the
center of that membrane.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the issue
about this is, if we

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
tried to feed the cell
some food in our model,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
so let's take a
spoonful of grape juice

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and drop it on the bread
and butter sandwich,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
the question is this.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Will that food
enter into the cell?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you section this
bread and butter sandwich,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:90%
guess what you find.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the phosphate groups
would absorb the food,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
but the food would not be able
to penetrate through the lipid

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
layer in the middle,
and therefore nothing

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
can get into the cell,
and in fact, nothing

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
can get out of the cell because
the membrane at this point

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is simply a barrier
with a hydrophobic core

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in the center of it.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:10%
Yet, the membrane is
responsible for allowing food

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:10%
to come in and waste
products to come out

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:10%
as well as signals to come in.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, how can this occur
in a bread and butter sandwich?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:84%
What was not seen in
the electron microscope

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
in our picture of the
crystalline structure

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of this membrane is the
fact that there are proteins

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:90%
built into the membrane.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're built
into the membrane,

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
hence, the name
of these proteins

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
are called integral membrane
proteins, abbreviated as IMPs.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
two major classes

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
of IMPs built into the membrane.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
One of these protein classes
is called a receptor.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what are receptors?

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are
proteins that respond

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.646 align:middle line:90%
to environmental signals.

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
because our skin

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is analogous to the
membrane of the cell.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And where do you think
our receptors are?

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Eyes, ears, nose taste, touch,
pain, temperature, pressure.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Like the cell, our receptors are
built into the skin, the cell

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:90%
membrane.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But when we go back
to the cell membrane,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
the receptor is simply a
protein with an antenna,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and the antenna
vibrates and resonates

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with signals in the
environment, so a receptor

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:90%
picks up a signal.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
What happens to a protein when
it complements with a signal?

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
When a signal shows up that the
receptor can read, guess what?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The receptor changes
shape, and now the receptor

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
can connect to the
second class of proteins,

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and this class of proteins
includes channels.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, channels, as the
name said, are proteins

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.135 align:middle line:90%
that have a conduit through it.

00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
In a resting state,
a channel is closed

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
so nothing can get
through that channel.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But when the channel is
activated by a signal,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
the channel opens up and
allows the conduction

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
from one side of the channel to
the other side of the channel.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:84%
To visualize what this
actually represents,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I have an animation.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of membrane
cut out of a cell.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
In it, you'll see a receptor
with an antenna and a channel,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and at this point,
the channel is closed.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, what will happen is this.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The receptor is scanning the
environment for a signal,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and when the signal
shows up, it's

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
going to cause the
receptor to change shape.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:10%
And when this receptor
changes shape,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:10%
it allows a protein,
called a G protein,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:10%
to connect between the
receptor and the channel.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
When the G protein
connects to the channel,

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
that's the signal for
the channel to open up.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And when the
channel opens up, it

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
forwards a signal
from the environment

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
into the cell, a
physical signal,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that will now control
the behavior of the cell

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:90%
inside the cytoplasm.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is actually a switch.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a membrane
switch, a response

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
to a primary
environmental signal.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Through the
receptor, the channel

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
creates a secondary signal
which goes into the cell

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:90%
to control its function.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So the receptor and
channel are devices

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to read an environmental
signal, that's the receptor,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and then to send a
signal into the cell

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to control the proteins and
the behavior in the cell.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the function
of the channel.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Another way of
understanding this

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:10%
is that the receptor
and the channel

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:10%
represent an
information processor--

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:10%
the receptor reading
environmental information;

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:10%
the channel forwarding a
signal into the cell based

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:10%
on that information
and then adjusting

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:10%
the function inside the cell.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we go back to our
bread and butter sandwich.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And now I say, let's put some
channel proteins in there.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'll resemble
olives put into a sandwich.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I say, now what?

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, let's feed
that sandwich the blue

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.312 align:middle line:90%
juice that we fed before.

00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:84%
However, this time
what you can see

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
is something very different.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
When the pimento is
out of the olive,

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the channel exists
and the food can now

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
pass from the outer surface
and go inside the cell.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
If the pimento is
still in the olive,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:90%
nothing can get through it.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I go, so what is the
difference between a pimento

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and not having a pimento?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's simply this.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
When the channel protein
is not activated,

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:90%
it is tightly closed.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But when the signal shows
up in the environment,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
it causes a protein
to change shape

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:90%
which opens up the channel.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So an open channel is like
an olive without a pimento,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
it lets things in
and across the cell.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we understand now
that the membrane

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is reading environment
and then adjusting

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the function of the
inside of the cell.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does
this also represent?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, as an
information processor,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:10%
you can also mention the
receptor as being the input

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:10%
and the channel
being the output.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And what's really important
about this information is,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
input/output is also recognized
in information processing

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
as I/O.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting about that

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is that I/O represents a bit
of data in a computer chip.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it also represents a bit
of data in a cell membrane.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:84%
What it represents is
how a cell responds

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to an environmental signal by
sending a signal into the cell

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to adjust the function
of the cytoplasm.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at the
surface of the cell, what

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
you can see all over the
surface are protein receptors,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and there are antennas
on these receptors.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:84%
These antennas are
actually sugar groups,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and these sugar groups
vibrate and resonate.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
The significance is
that when a signal that

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is in harmony with a receptor,
it shows up in the environment,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
it is picked up by
the sugar antenna,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and that causes the
protein that the antenna

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
is attached to to change shape
and then connect to a channel.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.352 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
surface of the cell,

00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
then what you would
see is the cell

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
is covered by a myriad
of receptors and antennas

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%
sticking off the surface.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
To give you an important
analogy of what this represents,

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the receptors on the
surface of the cell membrane

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:84%
are equal to a
keyboard on a computer.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Each key on a computer
is sending information

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:90%
into the computer.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Each receptor on the
surface of the cell membrane

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:10%
is sending a specific piece
of information into the cell

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:10%
to control its function.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The signals of the
environment are

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
typing on the
surface of the cell

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
by activating these
receptors which

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
are the keys that send
information in the cell that

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
control the function.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So we now have a basic switch,
and this switch represents

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:90%
a receptor and a channel.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And the significance of that
is, the receptor is reading

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:90%
the environmental signal.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
The channel is forwarding
that signal inside the cell.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
about 100,000 switches

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
any cell reading

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
a myriad number of
environmental signals

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
that the cell is experiencing
and allowing the cell

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to adapt its
function to whatever

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the environment.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
name of this switch?

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
A receptor effector integral
membrane protein complex.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Wow, big deal.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%
However, guess what?

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
If I define the switch
by its function,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
it comes up with a word that
we're all familiar with--

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:90%
perception.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:10%
The definition of perception
in the dictionary--

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:10%
"Awareness of the
elements of environment

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:10%
through physical sensation."

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:10%
I say, so what's the
significance of this?

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
The switch represents
perception.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Perception is the ability to
respond to the environment.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, then,
what controls the cell?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Perceptions control the cell.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Change your perception
and you change

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:90%
the function of the cell.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But then this brings in
a very interesting point.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Are all of our
perceptions accurate?

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is no.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We obviously all have what
are called misperceptions.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So I have a different
name for the switch now.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The switch represents
belief because that's

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:90%
what perceptions are, beliefs.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, what does
this ultimately come down to?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Belief is controlling
your biology.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Change your belief,
change your perceptions,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and you change the function
and character of your cells.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So now I say, well, how
does this actually work?

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.680 align:middle line:90%
What is the real mechanism?

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a surprise to
me, because back in 1985 I

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:84%
was trying to write the
definition of the cell membrane

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to include what I
just understood.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Yet, at that time, in
1985, conventional science

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
was of the belief that
genes were controlling

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:90%
the function of the cell.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I showed them
my results of how

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I changed the
environment and how

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I changed the fate of the
cells, they shrugged it off as,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
well, it's not really relevant
because we're all studying

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:90%
in genes and you're not.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So there I was, in 1985,
writing a new definition

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
of the cell membrane.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
My first part of
the definition is,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
well, remember the lipids that
are making up that membrane,

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
the phospholipids?

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're organized into
a crystalline structure.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not a crystal
like quartz or diamonds.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a flexible crystal.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And in today's world we
talk about flexible crystals

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%
as being liquid crystals.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first part
of my definition

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is, the cell membrane
is a liquid crystal.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:10%
But remember, without the
proteins in the cell membrane,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:10%
nothing could come across
that cell membrane,

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:10%
so a plain phospholipid membrane
actually was a nonconductor.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
However, once you added
the proteins into the cell,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
the channels allowed for
conduction from some signals

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
from the outside to
penetrate into the cell

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and control its function.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, here comes a
very important point.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Channels are very specific.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
There are sodium channels,
potassium channels, calcium

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
channels, glucose channels.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Not all signals can cross
a membrane, only signals

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that have a channel
that recognizes them.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So the membrane is no
longer a nonconductor,

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a full
conductor because it

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't conduct everything.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%
It is a semiconductor.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So I add that definition to
my membrane-- a liquid crystal

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:90%
semiconductor.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But then I have to define the
nature of the proteins that

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
are built into the membrane
that are controlling

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the functions, the proteins
that are the switch.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
There are two kinds of proteins
that comprise a switch--

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:90%
a receptor and a channel.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, interestingly, guess what?

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a synonym for
the word receptor,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:90%
and that's called gate.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So I write down, well,
what kind of proteins

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
are built into
the cell membrane?

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:10%
Gates and channels.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:10%
And then I stand back and I
look at what I just wrote.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And here's the definition
of a cell membrane.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:10%
The cell membrane is a
liquid crystal semiconductor

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:10%
with gates and channels.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I
said, oh my god, I just

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:90%
read that definition somewhere.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Where did I read that?

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had just bought my
first Macintosh computer,

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and I bought a book
from Radio Shack,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
understanding your
microprocessor, a simpleton

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
book in understanding
how computers work.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately I
opened up that book

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and there it was right in
the introduction to the book.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
a computer chip

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is "a crystal semiconductor
with gates and channels."

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what a coincidence.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
the cell membrane

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same definition
as a silicon-based computer

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:90%
chip.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But then, as I started
to match the structures

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to the functions, between
the carbon-based chip called

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the cell membrane and the
silicon-based chip that are

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:90%
in our computers, guess what?

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.790 align:middle line:10%
Piece by piece, each part
represented the same function

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:10%
in both the silicon chip
and the carbon-based chip.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Significance all of a
sudden came to me and said,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, the membrane
is not like a chip.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:90%
The membrane is a chip.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an information processor,
a carbon-based chip,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and it was only created
about three billion years

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
before scientists
created the silicon chip.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And it works in exactly
the same mechanism.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Typing information
into your computer,

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
it goes through the
chip and then comes out

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%
as data on the screen.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.220 align:middle line:84%
The silicon chip,
that's how it works,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
but the carbon-based
chip of the membrane

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
does something very similar.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:10%
The environment send signals to
the cell, types on the surface,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and then the gate
and channel switches

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:10%
create that function
inside the cell

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:10%
to match what's going
on in the environment.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
it's like, oh my god,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
we now have an understanding
of the nature of consciousness,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamental unit of
consciousness is a perception.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:52.440 align:middle line:84%
A perception is an expression of
a receptor effector or receptor

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:90%
channel complex.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about
that is, well, up to now,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:84%
how can you measure
consciousness?

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can take
tests like IQ tests

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and all that, observe
animals and their behavior

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and their responses
to the world.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.540 align:middle line:84%
That shows us that animals
can respond to the world

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
through consciousness, but
it doesn't show how it works.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the first time,
there's a physical expression

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanism that
converts environmental signals

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness, and these
are the protein switches.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Later in this
program we're going

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to talk about evolution and how
these protein switches account

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
for the current evolution and
for the future of evolution.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, let's just
review what we just observed.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.815 align:middle line:84%
A cell membrane is
a skin of a cell.

00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Underneath that
cell membrane are

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the contents of the cytoplasm
which include the proteins

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as the nucleus which
includes the chromosomes

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
with the genetic information.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Environmental signals
hit specific receptors

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
on the surface by complementing
the receptor antenna.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The receptor changes its
shape, forwards a signal

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
inside the cell, and that signal
is passed from one protein

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:90%
to another protein.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And every time a signal
picks up a protein

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and engages the function of
that protein, all the pathways

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
inside the cell that account
for metabolism, movement,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
intelligence of
the nervous system,

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
all the functions
of the cells, are

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
due to the environmental
signals engaging

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:84%
the functions of
cytoplasmic proteins.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion,
cells are intelligent.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're super
intelligent because think

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Cells created human
beings, and cells

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
have functions that even
human science can't reproduce.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And since we are made
of cells, an insight

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
into the structure and function
of the cell's nervous system

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:84%
would reveal the foundation
of how our own nervous system

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:90%
manifests consciousness.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
While we used to study
genes as the primary insight

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to understanding how cells
work, a new field of study

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
called signal transduction
is now the primary emphasis

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:90%
of scientific research.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the science
that studies how

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
signals from the
environment engage

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:90%
the functions of the cell.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So signals from the environment,
through the cell membrane,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
through the proteins in the
cytoplasm into the nucleus,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:90%
control gene activity.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a subdivision of
signal transduction science,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
but it has its own special name.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It's called epigenetics.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%
