>> We're all familiar with the
illusion that objects made out

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.420 align:middle line:84%
of matter appear to be
distinct and separate entities.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, quantum
physics emphasizes

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
entangled, forming

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:90%
a whole, or singularity.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we live
in an entangled universe?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Bruce
Lipton, for this series

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.887 align:middle line:90%
on inner revolution.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
To visualize how
what we perceive

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as matter is influenced
by energy fields,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
we must first understand
how energy waves entangle

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and generate constructive
and destructive interference

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
patterns that influence the
character of the material

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Both quantum physics
and the new biology

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
emphasize the influence of
the mind's energy field,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, as fundamental
in shaping our life experiences.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
In previous episodes, we
provided a simple formula

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:90%
for the nature of life.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is protein plus
signal equals behavior.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the issue is we know
what the proteins are.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of
signals are used

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in creating the life
that we experience?

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, conventional science
and conventional medicine,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
allopathic medicine,
employs the idea

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that the body is a
physical mechanism

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and can only respond
to physical signals,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
hence the use of
pharmaceuticals and drugs.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a new understanding

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that completely changes
our belief system,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
because quantum physics
reveals that energy is really

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:90%
the source of everything.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And so looking at the
body as a physical entity

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is actually an illusion,
an incorrect understanding.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we talk
about energy, we

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
can actually define it using
two different characteristics

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
One is force and
one is information.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Energy as a force,
for example, is

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:90%
what is used to drive our car.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Energy is a force
that creates movement.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the force
that medicine actually

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
considers energy that influences
physical matter by disturbing

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:90%
This is called ionizing energy.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
It's energy like UV
light from the sun when

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
you get a sunburn or x-rays
when too many x-rays actually

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:90%
can burn the tissue.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Then these energies
become part of the realm

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of conventional medicine
because of their influence

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:90%
on our so-called physical body.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
different use for energy.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Energy is also information.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.448 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, the
cell phone broadcasts

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that are going through
this room right now,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
well, they don't
exhibit much force.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But they do carry a
lot of information.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Television signals?

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Not forceful, but information.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is this.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the force
element of energy is

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
covered by conventional
allopathic medicine.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
function of energy

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%
that deals with information?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, that
is with the primary subject

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of complementary and
integral medicine,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
bringing in energy
fields, consciousness,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and thought into our world.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes
important for us

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
information as energy

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is profoundly important in
shaping who and what we are.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
We have two perceptions now
about what controls biology--

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
physical things, such as
drugs, or energy fields.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting
because a physicist

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
by the name of McClare at
the University of London

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
wanted to identify, is
signaling using chemistry

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
more effective or less
effective than using signals

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.402 align:middle line:90%
provided by energy?

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
profound difference

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
in which type of source of
information is being used,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
chemistry or energy
fields, for this reason.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you might remember,
when you were in chemistry class

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
early in your
school history, you

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
mixed a couple of
components in a test tube.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And you held that test
tube, and you felt the heat

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:90%
coming from that test tube.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
heat of reaction.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a thermochemical coupling.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what's
significant about that?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
By definition, heat
is wasted energy.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So significance is, when
you use a chemical or a drug

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to carry information, when
that chemical or drug binds

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to another chemical in the body,
according to McClare, up to 98%

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:84%
of the available energy
of a chemical drug

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually dissipated
and wasted as heat.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, energy
signals don't give off

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:90%
thermochemical reactions.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Energy signals are
almost 100% transferred

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:84%
between the source and the
receptor of that energy.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:90%
There is no loss.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So according to
McClare, quantum physics

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
reveals that, in biology,
energy vibration signals

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
would undoubtedly be selected
over chemical signals

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:90%
in controlling our behavior.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is the actual role?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that energy
vibration is that important?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
In a more recent study
in the journal "Nature,"

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the most prestigious
journals on the planet,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
there's an interesting article
by two authors, Pophristic

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and Goodman.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I love the title, because
science is like the church.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:84%
We put into Latin, and
nobody knows what the heck

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
So listen to this title.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
"Hyperconjugation
not steric repulsion

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
leads to the staggered
structure of ethane."

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, it means simply this.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Ethane molecules twist
and rotate as molecules.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:90%
They twist and rotate.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what's
the relevance?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the same process that
proteins use to create life.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And here's the point.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Science is based
on predictability.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And what Pophristic and
Goodman wanted to do

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
was predict the movement from
ethane's primary structure

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and all the intermediate
stages as the ethane manifests

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:90%
its secondary structure.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
predict the movements,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.133 align:middle line:84%
then you would understand
the mechanism that

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:90%
provides for those movements.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, they started off using the
principles of Newtonian physics

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to try to identify the
intermediate stages

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of the ethane structure.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They were unable to predict
those intermediate stages.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Point is very clear.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The movement of
that ethane molecule

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
was not using Newtonian
physics in the process.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So they then applied quantum
mechanical principles

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:90%
to the same ethane molecule.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, they were
able to accurately predict

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
all the intermediate
stages of that molecule

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.040 align:middle line:84%
from its original shape
to its secondary shape.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The significance is profound,
because basically what it says

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is the movement of molecules,
the same as the movement

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
of proteins that create
life, are actually

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
regulated by quantum
physical principles

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:90%
and not Newtonian principles.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The significance of
this was actually

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
spelled out in an editorial
in the very same journal

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
of "Nature."

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
The editorial's title I love--

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
"A new twist on
molecular shape."

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The author, Frank
Weinhold, writes

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:90%
this in the introduction.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
"What are the
forces that control

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
the twisting and folding of
molecules into complex shapes?"

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.635 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a good question.

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it's a good question

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
is because that's the mechanism
where life comes from.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we could understand the
forces that provide for that,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
then we can understand the
forces that provide for life.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Frank Weinhold goes
on to say, "Don't

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.923 align:middle line:84%
look for the answers in your
organic chemistry textbook."

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
That sounds a little
cryptic, but here's

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:90%
what's important about it.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine is
based on the principles

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:90%
in organic chemistry.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And what Weinhold
is saying is, if you

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
want to understand how
life works, don't look

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
in that textbook, because
organic chemistry is predicated

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
on Newtonian physics
and does not understand

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the relevance of
the quantum physics

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
in controlling the
character of life.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So the belief in
materialism that we've

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
as the foundation

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of the current culture, which
is scientific materialism,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:90%
is flawed.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea of
materialism, a Newtonian idea,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is not valid in a
quantum physical world,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the one in which we
are living right now.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically it says we
have to understand life

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I show you this picture
of two atoms interacting.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Our conventional
understanding is two atoms

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:84%
come together, have a
collision, and, in that process,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:90%
create chemistry.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But that is a
Newtonian illusion.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to
understand how atoms interact

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to create life, we
have to understand

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the nature of energy waves.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, instead of seeing atoms
as individual particles, what

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
we can look at is atoms
as the presence of waves.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
When atoms interact,
it's the waves

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that are interacting,
because there's

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:90%
nothing physical in the atom.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's called
interference.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Where the ripples interact,
they create special patterns

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:90%
of interference.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interference of
these atoms are the ripples.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But the ripples
constitute the field.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And the field is
the invisible energy

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of ripples of energy surrounding
all of us at all times.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Also recognize this.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, thought, is
an expression of the field.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I emphasize
Albert Einstein's quote.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
The field-- the energy--

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
is the sole governing
agency of the particle--

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
particle being matter.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And that changes how
we look, because it's

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
been left out of our
understanding of science.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And to try to get
an understanding

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:84%
of how complex this
is, imagine seeing

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.705 align:middle line:90%
raindrops fall on a pond--

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and not looking
at the raindrops,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.580 align:middle line:84%
but looking at all the ripples
that come from the raindrops.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So, for a moment, consider
the raindrop as an atom,

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and the ripples it's
generating are going

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:90%
across the surface of the pond.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Look at the complex interaction.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything is interconnected.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
All the waves from all the
ripples from all the raindrops

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%
are interfering with each other.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
biology works, we

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:90%
are a set of ripples and waves.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're in a field
of ripples and waves,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and we also generate
ripples and waves

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
when we express consciousness.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
When ripples come together,
they interfere with each other.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's also called
entanglement--

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're connected
with each other

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're
influencing each other.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, to illustrate
this point, I'm

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
going to use a diagram
with waves in it.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.895 align:middle line:84%
And I drop both rocks into
the pond at the same time.

00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And the ripples are
coming toward each other.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I'm going to
overlap the ripples from wave A

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:90%
with the ripples from wave B.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
When the waves
come together, you

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
add up the values of the
waves and the overlap.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Plus 1 plus 1, the
value is plus 2.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
When two lower
energies come together

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're both in
harmony, they add up.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
And the waves are much higher.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Wave height is equal to power.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:90%
So the point is simply this.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Constructive interference
where the waves come together

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and create higher waves is
also recognized in our life

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
experiences as good vibes.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're in that
field, the energy around you

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
is interfering with you
in a constructive manner.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you are
feeling more energy--

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
good vibes.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Vibes are the source of life.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.785 align:middle line:90%
Energy is the source of life.

00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
When you have a lot of
energy, you have life.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
When you have no energy,
you have no life.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when energies are
in harmony and they interfere--

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:90%
constructive interference--

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
it presents something that
we refer to as good vibes.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because we use these vibes

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
to manage our lives.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a simple
insight, which I really

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:90%
find kind of interesting.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's a big shoe
sale at a major department

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 pair
of shoes for sale.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They're all exactly
the same price.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They come in all your
sizes and colors.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
different styles.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
You go into the store.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You're going to buy
a pair of shoes.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the final
decision was based on?

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Not the costs.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Not the color, size.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
You can get those in any one.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:90%
The final decision is what?

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
The shoes made you feel better.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
The shoes gave you a feeling.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
You picked a pair of
shoes because of what?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Feelings.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:90%
What's feeling?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Energy interactions.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It's related to everything
we do in the world--

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
the people you meet up
with, the places you live.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
What's going on around
you in the energy

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is actually interfering
with your energy.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when the energy around
you is in harmony with you,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
guess what it does?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It enhances your energy.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It empowers you.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Constructive
interference-- good vibes.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's one
side of the story.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Here's the other side.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
What if I take the two
rocks that I had before,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
but I dropped one before
I dropped the other?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
What we can see is,
the two waves coming,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
you can see they're
out of phase.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we overlap them
like we did previously.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And I say this is interference.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Plus 1 is the height.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Minus 1 is the valley.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Add them up--

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:90%
0.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
The waves are canceling
each other out.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The energy from
one is interfering

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:84%
not in a constructive manner,
but in a destructive manner.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:90%
You've also experienced this.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.367 align:middle line:90%
But it's called bad vibes.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an interaction you
have with the environment.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
It takes away your energy,
which by definition means

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:90%
takes away your life.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.003 align:middle line:90%
You're in a city.

00:14:54.003 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
where you're going.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You're nervous, now,
about where you are.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you feel
your energy dissipate, go away.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You feel like you're vulnerable.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
You have very low energy.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Your biology was interacting
with the waves and the field

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But these interactions are out
of harmony with each other.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the interfering
waves' destructive interference

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
are canceling the energy.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, energy is life.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Canceling energy leads to death.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it
say, oh, my goodness.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
You can make decisions in
your life appropriately

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
when you read the energy first.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And the significance is this.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
You always will
move toward things

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
that give you enhanced energy
that will enhance your life.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, you
should always move away

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
from anything that
takes away your energy--

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
destructive
interference, bad vibes--

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
because that's an information
that's telling you

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer
safe in your field.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Interesting point.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Humans have vast
language capabilities.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Every organism, from
bacteria all the way up

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and including
humans, also respond

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to the invisible
energy waves reading

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
good vibes and bad vibes.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And I say this is how a
primitive organism know

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
how to sustain its life.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It moves toward anything
that gives it a good vibe

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and moves away from anything
that gives it a bad vibe.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is how an organism
maintains its energy.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting,
because most of us

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:84%
have been programmed,
when we're young,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
not to go by the
feelings but listen

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:90%
to what the person has to say.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that's the
first big mistake.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
If you read the vibes of that
individual, the vibes are true.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
The words can be made up.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
That means while those words
coming from that individual

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
are so wonderful
and feel so great,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
the intent of that
individual is not actually

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to support your
viability, because, just

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
interacting with that
person, you already

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:90%
can feel the bad vibes.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
So the relevance is this.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:84%
The primary language on
this planet is vibration.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
Reading vibration
can enhance your life

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and save you from any problems
that destructive interference

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:90%
would have caused.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important to recognize
the vital nature of reading

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
energy fields-- so vital that
every organism on this planet

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
actually creates its life
based on reading these fields.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And everything generates fields.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if we look at
a picture of humans and I say,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
oh, look, you can
see all these humans

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
in this picture, I go,
well, as we've talked about,

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that's actually the reflection
of the photons of light,

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because a human is
actually an energy.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, the
significance is this.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
When we use light
to reference people,

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
we see people as individuals.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But if we could read the
energy fields of these people,

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:90%
guess what we would find?

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
All the energies are
interacting with each other.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
In a family, yes,
they're independent.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
A mother, a father,
and children.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in a family,
each one of them

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:90%
is generating an energy field.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And entanglement, the
interaction of energy,

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:90%
is occurring throughout.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance
is simply this.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
A person shows up
at a doctor's office

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
complaining about some
illness or some problem

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:90%
with their life.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
The doctor looks at him
and says, let's assess you.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We'll read all
your chemical tests

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:90%
and all these different tests.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to read that out
and tell you what's going on.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an interesting
way to look at it.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
But here's something
that's more important.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
What's going on is
not only associated

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
with what's going on in
my own particular body.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
What's going on
is the environment

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:90%
in which I'm living.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
of everything around

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:90%
me is impacting my energy.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
it can enhance

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:84%
my life and my
vitality and my health,

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:90%
or the energy can take it apart.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:84%
If you judge a person's
health by just looking

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
at their physical
presence in front of you,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
you're missing what might be
the most important contributors

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
to health or disease
in this case.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And that is the environment.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The environment in
which that person lives,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:84%
the environment in
which that person works,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
the environment of the people
that surround this individual.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
These are all very
critical understandings.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so just looking at
the physical expression

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of a body trying to figure out
where the illness comes from

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is frequently misleading,
because the illness does not

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:90%
have to start in the body.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It could have been due to bad
vibes, destructive interference

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of the environment in
which that person lives.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate the
importance of how

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
the field, the energy around
you, shapes your physicality,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.263 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to show you
a simple experiment.

00:19:49.263 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
In this experiment,
what I did was

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:90%
take a bar of iron and a file.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I filed that iron down and
created a pile of iron dust,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
or iron filings.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I take those iron filings,
put them in a salt shaker,

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and I sprinkle them
on a piece of paper.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the image that you
get by sprinkling these iron

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:90%
filings on the paper.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.105 align:middle line:84%
It's a random pile
of iron filings.

00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:90%
I say, throw it away.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Sprinkle again.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Another random pile
of iron filings.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Every time you sprinkle the
iron filings, random pile.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But now I enhance the
experiment a little bit.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.985 align:middle line:90%
I buy a magnet.

00:20:23.985 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I put that magnet
underneath the piece of paper,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't form a random pile.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The invisible magnetic field
is shaping the iron filings

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to form a
complementary structure

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:90%
to the invisible magnetic field.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Eistein-- the field is
the sole governing agency

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of the particle-- in this
case, the iron filings.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance
about this is matter

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:90%
plus field equals structure.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Matter without field?

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Random pile.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden it says then
the structure that you express

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is not due to just
the structure.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It's due to the fields
around this structure.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at that
slide of iron filings

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:90%
over the magnetic field.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, instead
of iron filings,

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
let's suggest that
this is a tumor.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.083 align:middle line:84%
And those iron filings
are tumor cells.

00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
say, well, what's

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:90%
the conventional understanding?

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
The allopathic Newtonian
vision is, well, this tumor

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
must be shaped by
something physical.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And so we take apart the cells.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:90%
And we look for what?

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Onco gene.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:90%
A cancer gene.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:90%
A gene that causes this problem.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
You can take apart all
the cells you want.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no gene
that caused that.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a field that causes that.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The field is shaping the
cells, just as the field

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
shapes iron filings.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And we keep looking
inside the cell to say,

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
where the heck did
that cancer come from?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:90%
It does not come from genes.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Simple fact.

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
There is no gene
that causes cancer.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I always get concerned
when women do a test

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and they find that they have
the BRCA1 cancer gene, how

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that really messes with their
head based on the belief

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Belief system--
you got the gene.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:90%
You can expect the cancer.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.205 align:middle line:84%
Angelina Jolie, she had
a double mastectomy.

00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have the cancer.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
She just figured, because her
mother died of breast cancer,

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:84%
her grandmother died
of breast cancer,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:90%
that she's going to die as well.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So she figured, if
I have a mastectomy,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:90%
I won't have the problem.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not true,
because the same gene also

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:90%
causes uterine cancers as well.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:90%
But here's the other story.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And the story is this.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Does having the BRCA1 gene mean
you're going to get the cancer?

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is absolutely no.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
50% of the women with the
gene never get the cancer.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a very important fact.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Possession of the gene
doesn't mean cancer.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the lifestyle associated
with possession of that gene

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:90%
that will manifest the cancer.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why half
the women are not

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
expressing a negative or
non-supporting lifestyle.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They're expressing a
normal healthy life.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of having the
gene, they won't get the cancer.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But somebody with that gene
who is not living in harmony,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:84%
not living in the balance
of the environment,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:90%
they can get the cancer.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Point simply is this--

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the gene does not
cause the cancer.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It is correlated with cancer.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:90%
The cause is the field--

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:90%
how we are living our lives.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
profoundly important point

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
comes to the forefront
and says this.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Less than 10% of disease
has any physical connection

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
with our genetics and
maybe even less than 1%.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So a cancer is not a disease
as much as it is a symptom.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:90%
A cancer is a symptom.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not living in harmony.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Look what I manifest.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Changing the
character of your life

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is profoundly
important in changing

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
the character of a cancer.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Something called a
spontaneous remission

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:90%
occurs quite frequently.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
What is a spontaneous remission?

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
An individual is
given a prognosis

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, my
goodness, you're going

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%
to die in about three months.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what does
that individual do?

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
If they buy the belief of
the doctor, guess what?

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to create
a consciousness that

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
will manifest that
physical experience.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And the cancer will kill
them in about three months.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast, other
people will go, well, wait.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to die
in three months,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
quit the stupid job.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to leave the
aggravating environment

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:90%
that I'm in.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go on
the road, and I'm

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
going to enjoy myself for
the last three months.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
Three months come and go.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Six months, a year, five
years, they're still here.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
What did they do
that was different?

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
They didn't change
the physical cancer.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They changed the environment
that promoted the cancer.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
A spontaneous remission, there's
a change in the belief system,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.805 align:middle line:90%
a change in the consciousness.

00:25:08.805 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is
profoundly important,

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
because this is where we have to
understand the control of life

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:90%
What is your consciousness?

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you visioning a
healthy, happy life?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Or are you concerned that
running in your family

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
is cardiovascular
disease or diabetes?

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Point is very simple.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
What image you hold
in your consciousness

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is translated into a
physical expression.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:84%
You can absolutely
change your life

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
by changing your consciousness,
because this is the foundation

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:90%
behind epigenetics.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is the story of
how vibration will also

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
select our genes
and the character

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of that genetic expression.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
The insights offered
by quantum physics

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
really reveal the whole story
about how our consciousness is

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%
creating our life experiences.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
If I go back to 1930, just
after quantum physics came

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
science, I want

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to leave you with a quote
from Sir James Jeans.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
"The stream of
knowledge is heading

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
towards a
non-mechanical reality.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The universe begins to look
more like a great thought

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:90%
than like a great machine.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Mind no longer appears to
be an accidental intruder

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:90%
into the realm of matter.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
We ought rather hail it as
the creator and the governor

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
of the realm of matter."

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And to follow that
up, at the same time,

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Eddington,
another physicist, wrote,

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
"It is difficult for the
matter of fact physicists

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to accept the view that the
substratum of everything

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:90%
is a mental character."

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
These two physicists
are actually

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
giving us the most
important conclusions

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of quantum physics--

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that mind and consciousness
and energy fields

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
are what shape our
life experiences.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand
that, then we say, well,

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.790 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
change your life, you

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
don't have to do
anything physical.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to do
something in regard

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:90%
to your consciousness.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, what
does this mean for you?

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The quality of
life is profoundly

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.460 align:middle line:90%
influenced by energy.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
When energy waves
interfere with each other,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
they may express
constructive interference

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that enhances life energy or
destructive interference that

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:90%
actually cancels life energy.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
To learn how we can
control our consciousness

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and manifest the
life we desire, it

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is first necessary
to understand how

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
cells manage environmental
signals and controlling

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
behavior and genetics.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Next, we will describe the
nature of the cell's brain

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and how it translates
environmental signals that

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:90%
control our biology.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
