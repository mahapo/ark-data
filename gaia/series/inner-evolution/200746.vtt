>> How will communicating
with nature help us survive

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:90%
a crisis?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Bruce Lipton.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host for this
series, "Inner Evolution."

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.396 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The first episode of the
series presented the fact

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that civilization is on
the brink of the sixth mass

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
extinction of life due to
the destructive behavior

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:84%
of our beliefs and the
culture that they influence.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Four commonly held
misperceptions

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:10%
have unfortunately disconnected
civilization from nature.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We have previously debunked the
first two of these assumptions,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
that, A, biology is controlled
by Newtonian physics for we now

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
know it is controlled
by quantum physics

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and, B, that genes
control our biology,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and now we recognize
it as epigenetics

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:90%
that controls our biology.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The third and fourth
misperceptions

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are based on incorrect
assumptions espoused

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
by the Darwinian
theory of evolution.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:10%
These misperceptions
led to the belief

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:10%
that evolution is driven
by random alterations

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:10%
in organismal genetics.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, genetics
has since become

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the metric that
presumably defines

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
the character of evolution.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
However, the Human Genome
Project completely undermined

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
this idea when it was found that
the human genome was no larger

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
than that for a 1,271-cell
microscopic worm.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Also incorrect is the
idea that competition

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is the drive force
for evolution,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
for now cooperation
is recognized

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:90%
as encouraging evolution.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, the belief that random
accidental mutations initiate

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
evolution suggests that
there is no purpose

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:90%
to our earthly existence.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:90%
We are here simply by chance.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:10%
To understand how we can survive
the current mass extinction

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:10%
event, we must rewrite
our cultural beliefs

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:10%
and learn how to live
in harmony with nature.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
acquiring awareness

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
at the fate of the planet's
remaining indigenous people,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
we can learn a lot from studying
nature's fractal geometry.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Inherent in the principles
of fractal geometry

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:10%
is the scientific foundation for
the ancient saying "as above,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:10%
so below."

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Exploiting this character
of fractal structures

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:10%
offers an opportunity to
acquire valuable life-enhancing

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:10%
practices by studying the
life-sustaining behaviors

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
of organisms lower on
the evolutionary tree

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:10%
and applying those lessons
directly to our lives.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:10%
So let's dive deeper
into this understanding.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The results of the Human Genome
Project reveal that evolution

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
cannot be understood in
terms of organismal genomes.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
An understanding that
genetic alterations are not

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
due to chance is actually
recognized in the nature

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:90%
of the immune system.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Consider this very
important fact.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
If I inject an antigen into
your body, in three days,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
you will create a
perfect antibody

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to complement that
antigen. The significance

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is an antibody is
the result of a gene.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:10%
Is there chance in this process
of creating an antibody?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:10%
No, because you can
actually predict that it

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:10%
will occur in three days.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:10%
And so the significance
is simply this.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:10%
It's not a chance.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:10%
It's predictable.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:10%
And so the alteration of
the immune system's gene

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:10%
to create an antibody is an
example of a directed mutation.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Organismal evolution
is actually connected

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to efforts of an organism
to conform with its existing

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
environmental influences.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Evolution emphasizes
that organisms

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
adapt to support the
whole web of life.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Evolution has a purpose
to maintain harmony

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:90%
in the environment.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Human civilization's
failure to understand

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the nature of evolution is
responsible for precipitating

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
the planet's sixth
mass extinction.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Nature is expressed in the
form of physical structures

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Nature employs
patterns that define

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
the structural
organization of matter.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Mathematicians
downloaded the principles

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
providing nature's
patterns and defined them

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
mathematical formulas.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Geometry is the math of
creating structure in space.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people are aware
of Euclidean geometry,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
the math associated
with points or dots,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
lines, flat planes such
as rectangles, triangles,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and circles, and voluminous
structures, for example, cubes,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:90%
pyramids, and spheres.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Each of these objects has a
specific unit of dimension.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
A dot or a point
is zero dimensions.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:90%
A line is one dimensional.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:90%
A flat plane is two dimensional.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:10%
And a cube or a sphere
is three dimensional.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
This geometry is
used in architecture

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and in the designing of
mechanical technology.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
However, this geometry
does not reproduce

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
the designs nature
uses in creating

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the web of life, such as a
fern, a mountain, or a cloud.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The new math, fractal geometry,
is a mathematic that models

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
This math is based
on the use of what

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
are called recursive
equations, which

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:84%
mean an iterative procedure,
which, in itself, means

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:90%
a repetitive process.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Place a number into a fractal
formula, solve the equation,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and then insert the result back
into the original equation.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:10%
Solve the equation again, and
reinsert the new answer back

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:10%
into the original equation.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And this step can be
repeated infinitely.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
A simple recursive
equation is this.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Take a 12-inch line
and cut it in half.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:90%
A 6-inch line.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we put a 6-inch line, cut
it in half, and what do we get?

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:90%
A 3-inch line.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Take a 3-inch line,
cut it in half.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
A 1-and-1/2-inch line.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I say, how many times
can I repeat this?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is infinitely.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You can keep taking the result
of solving the equation,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
put it back into the equation,
and then solve it again.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So it could take millions
of iterations or repeats

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:90%
in solving a fractal formula.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Before computers, it would
have taken several years

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
working eight hours a
day of manually solving

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
a fractal equation to actually
visualize the resulting

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.115 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Point-- no one had ever
visualized the outcome

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:90%
of these recursive formulas.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:10%
But in 1975, Benoit
Mandelbrot used IBM computers

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:10%
to become the first
person to actually see

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:10%
the structures produced
by the infinite regression

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:10%
of a recursive equation.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
His starting formula, referred
to as the Mandelbrot set,

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
reveal structural images
identical to those

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:90%
found in nature.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
He referred to this math
as fractal geometry.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
For unlike Euclidean
geometry with whole integers

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of dimensions, such as one
dimensional, two dimensional,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.590 align:middle line:84%
three dimensional, this math
had fractional dimensions.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
What is a fractional
dimension of an object?

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, let's
take a piece of paper,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and imagine it has no
thickness, so it would represent

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:90%
a two-dimensional surface area.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we take that piece of
paper and crinkle it up

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:90%
into a small ball.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It will now have the appearance
of a three-dimensional object.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
However, if you section
this wadded-up paper,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
it still has a
two-dimensional geometry.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The object no longer
appears as two dimensional,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
nor is it actually
three dimensional.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It would be best described as
having 2 and 1/2 dimensions,

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
a fraction of a dimension.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Nature is fractal, so
that a structural pattern

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
at one level of
nature's organization

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
will be self-similar to
the pattern of structures

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
at higher or lower
levels of organization.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Since structure is frequently
associated with function,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
then the functions expressed
at one level of nature

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
will likely be self-similar
to the functions observed

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:90%
at other levels of nature.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
A model emphasizing
self-similarity

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
is illustrated in the nested
wooden Russian matryoshka

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:84%
dolls, a set of self-similar
wooden dolls of decreasing size

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:90%
placed one inside the other.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
A fundamental example of a
biological fractal expressing

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
self-similarity is
evident in comparing

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
the structure and
function of a cell

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:90%
with those of a human body.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
All functional systems and their
basic structural organization

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
observed in human were already
present in a single cell.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
If one understands a
physiological mechanism

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:84%
or behavior expressed
by a cell, that insight

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
can be used to understand the
basic mechanisms of a human.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
An example of finding peace and
balance in a fractal universe

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
is to consider the 118 atoms in
the periodic table of elements.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
In this periodic table,
all of the elements,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
except for those listed as
noble gases, create chemistry.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
The important
point is, then, how

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
come noble gases
don't make chemistry?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Noble gases include helium,
neon, argon, krypton, xenon,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and radon.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
These atoms don't normally
engage in chemical reactions.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that all atoms
except for the noble gases

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
do not contain a balanced
or full number of electrons

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%
in their outer electron shells.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
These spinning
imbalanced atoms wobble,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:84%
which results in a
loss of their energy.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So to conserve energy,
an atom that wobbles

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
will couple with another
out-of-balance atom that

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is also wobbling so that
the two, when connected,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:90%
may spin in harmony.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem in this
relationship is

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that it represents a
co-dependency, wherein

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
neither element is free
because it wobbles on its own.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But when put together
in a molecule,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
they will spin in
perfect balance.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, noble gas atoms
have a complete outer shell

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:84%
of electrons, and they
spin in perfect balance.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:90%
They do not wobble.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:10%
Consequently, they don't need
another atom for balance,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:10%
nor are they even
thrown out of balance

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:10%
by the wobble of other
atoms in their environment.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The understanding that
we get from noble gases

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is that when an atom spins in
perfect harmony and balance,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
that it is free and independent
of all the other atoms

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't need to
bond with another atom

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to maintain stability.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, how does
that relate to us?

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is simply this.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
During our developmental
period when

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
we were downloaded programs,
up to 70% of these programs

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
were disempowering,
self-sabotaging, and limiting.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
engage these behaviors,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
we're not spinning in
balance and in harmony.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:90%
We're out of balance.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:90%
We're wobbling.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, many
people in this state

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
look for balance in their
lives by doing what?

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Bonding with another
person, that when

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they come together,
that together,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:90%
they will spin in harmony.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's taking two wobble
atoms or two wobble people

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them together
in a codependent relationship

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:90%
to create harmony.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
However, what if we learn to
spin in harmony ourselves?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
What if we change the programs
that cause us to wobble and put

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
in programs in our
subconscious mind that keep us

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:90%
whole, healthy, and in harmony?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
In that case, we would spin in
balance just like a noble gas.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And we would not be affected
by out-of-balance people

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a very
special life because we're

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:90%
in harmony with ourselves.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
In science's effort to
understand the nature of life,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
science is focused on
evolution because that

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
was the mechanism that
controls the expression of all

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:90%
the organisms on this planet.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, based on
looking at evolution,

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:84%
what is the metric that
science is going to look at?

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, the first thing is this.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:84%
An organism is
comprised of proteins,

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and that proteins are
each created by a gene.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And in looking at the
complexity of organism

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and the complexity
of their proteins,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
biologists started to say,
look, organisms differ

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
in their physical complexity,
a reflection of their protein

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, and that
their proteins are

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of their genes.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So the nature of evolution
was some way tied

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to the expression of genes.

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
At least that's
what they thought.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.760 align:middle line:10%
And in 2001, the results
of the Human Genome Project

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:10%
were released.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And what they
found was something

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:90%
that blew their minds.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Rather than having
over 100,000 genes,

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
the human had only about 20,000
genes, the same number of genes

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
as the most primitive
organism at the tree of life.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it brought science down

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:90%
to a very simple fact--

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
genes are not the
metric of evolution.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So science's effort
left the genes behind

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and started to
understand the nature

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%
of the structure of life.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Euclidean geometry, it's a
fabulous mathematics for what?

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:10%
Creating buildings,
making machines,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:10%
and designing human technology.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:10%
But you cannot use conventional
Euclidean geometry to create

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:10%
a fern, a tree, a cloud.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Nature is structured on the
basis of fractional geometry

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
because this
geometry is not based

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
on whole integers of
dimensions such as one, two,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%
or three dimensional objects.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:10%
Because in fractal geometry,
there are such things

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:10%
as 1-and-1/2-dimensional
objects,

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:10%
2-and-1/2-dimensional objects,
fractions of an integer.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you use a
fractal equation

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and put mathematics
into it and plop

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
these fractal geometries in a
computer, guess what you find.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
The structures that result
from solving a fractal equation

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
are replicas of things
that we see in nature.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
it says, my goodness,

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:10%
you can put a number into
a fractional equation

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:10%
and create what?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Mountains with clouds.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, it says, this
is what nature is based on.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The significance is
profoundly important.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It says that when you
use fractal geometry,

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the structures are repeated
in a self-similar fashion

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:90%
at any level of organization.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:10%
So when you look at nature,
you could look at nature

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:10%
from the level of
atoms to the level

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:10%
of small bacterial organisms,
go up to the level of humans.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:10%
And guess what?

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:10%
In this evolutionary
span, you'll

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:10%
find the repetitive use
of the same structure

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:10%
and the same function
all over again

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:10%
and again, iterated, repeated.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a very
important consequence

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
nature of iteration.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It says if you want to
understand something

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
like the structure or
function of how a human works,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
do you have to work on
something this complex?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
You can get ideas and
information of self-similarity

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
by studying much
smaller structures that

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:90%
are easier to understand.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to understand
how a human works,

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:90%
think about this fact.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
There's not one new function in
a human body that's not already

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:84%
present in almost every
single cell in our body.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Single cells have what?

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:84%
A respiratory, a digestive, an
excretory, a nervous system,

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:90%
a reproductive system.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:10%
Single cells even
have an immune system.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Significance?

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
You want to understand
the function of a human?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty darn complex.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you study the
same functions that's

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
present in a single cell,
you'll get a basic insight

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
into the mechanisms that
provide for that function.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So instead of studying
very complex structures,

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:84%
this is why we
study cell biology.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Because in studying the
nature, the structure,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and the functions
expressed by cells,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
we can apply that information
and get an understanding

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
of much more complex structures,
such as that of the human body.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So there is a repetition of
self-similarity in the system.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Can we learn from that?

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course we
can learn from that.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the most profound
things that we can learn

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of
human relationships,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.333 align:middle line:84%
which seem to be an issue
on this planet at this time.

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
what can we learn

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
from the geometry of
nature that can help us

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
create better relationships
on this planet?

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We can study the atoms in the
periodic table of elements.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:10%
As mentioned earlier
in this episode,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:10%
the noble gases do
not create chemistry.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.400 align:middle line:84%
All the other
elements that don't

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
have a complete outer shell
wobble because there's

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:90%
an imbalance in the electrons.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And when atoms wobble, that's
a very inefficient activity

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
for atoms because it
causes them to lose energy.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
By forming chemistry
with another atom,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
this allows the atoms to
spin in perfect balance.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So the atoms have a
tendency to stay together

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
because together, they can
have that harmony and balance.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:10%
This is what drives chemistry.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:10%
But noble gases are
completely full.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:10%
They don't wobble.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They spin in perfect
balance, in harmony.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Significance is so
important for this reason.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many other
atoms are around a noble gas

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're out of
order and they're

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
wobbling all over the
place, the noble gas

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
will always stay
in perfect balance.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:10%
And then there's this
understanding that says, well,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:10%
wait, if atoms and noble
gas don't make chemistry,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:10%
then there's no relationship
between noble gases.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to go
into that after I first

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
try to give us a
fractal correlation

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of wobbling and
codependency and noble gases

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:90%
as they relate to human biology.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Humans are spinning atoms,
just like anything else.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And most of us wobble
because we're not in balance.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
We're not in harmony.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I say, what is throwing
a human out of balance,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
losing the harmony
of that human?

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
As we described in
previous episodes,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of a human
is first programmed

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
in the first seven years
of life of that individual.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But what we also found out is
up to 70% of these programs

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
are disempowering,
self-sabotaging,

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:90%
or limiting beliefs.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Consequence of that is
if you've been programmed

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:10%
with these disempowering
beliefs, that means you won't

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:10%
be able to spin in harmony.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Your harmony is
broken by the fact

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that the way you are behaving on
this planet is not in harmony.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:90%
It's out of balance.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:10%
So we're sort of like
those out-of-balance atoms,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:10%
all moving around.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:10%
And just like an out-of-balance
atom, what's our intention?

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
To spin in harmony.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Harmony is peace.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, if you're
an out-of-balance person,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:90%
how can you find harmony?

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Just the same way
that atoms did.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
We will find a partner who
is also out of balance.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:10%
Because if they're
out of balance

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:10%
and you're out of
balance, but you're

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:10%
complementary to each other,
when you come together,

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:10%
both of you can learn
how to spin and balance.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, great,
this is a drive force

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:90%
for creating relationship.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
There's an unfortunate
side effect.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And that unfortunate side effect
is this kind of relationship

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
expresses itself as
co-dependency, meaning what?

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
That you have to hold on to
each other to stay in balance.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And that forces people to be
in relationships that sometimes

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to be in.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But the choice is, if you're
not in that relationship,

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:90%
now you're going to wobble.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's totally an
inefficient and inharmonious

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
way to be on the planet.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So co-dependent relationships
bring people together

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
with the need to spin
in balance, a need.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:10%
And that takes away
an individual's

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:10%
personal independence
when this happens.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, guess what?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Not all people are
out of balance.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Some people are living
in perfect harmony

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.853 align:middle line:10%
with their world.

00:21:23.853 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are
the kind of people

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that you would say, well, these
are like noble gas people.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:84%
They're spinning
in perfect balance.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So they can walk through a
crowd of out-of-balance people

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:90%
and never be affected by them.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Now comes an interesting side
effect, and that is this.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:10%
Noble gases, as far as we
know, in normal chemistry

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:10%
do not make relationships.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:10%
Would that imply
then a person who

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:10%
is spinning in
harmony and balance

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:10%
like a noble gas would
avoid a relationship?

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't work very
well for us at all.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:10%
To understand something
that is really

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:10%
important to the noble
gas's life is simply this.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
When one of those perfectly
spinning noble gas atoms

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
gets hit by a photon
and absorbs that photon,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:90%
it becomes energized.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:90%
It becomes enlightened.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And in that state of
energized enlightenment,

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
guess what we find?

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
A noble gas will hook up
with another noble gas

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and create what
is conventionally

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
referred to as a dimer.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But in a state where two
noble gases come together

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because they're energized,
the term isn't dimer.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called excimer,
which is actually

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:90%
an abbreviation for excitimer.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And why is it an excitimer?

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Why is it an excited coupling
when they come together?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, as we will
see in the nature of bringing

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:84%
noble gases together, is
that they emit laser light.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all the
lasers on this planet

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
are driven by gas
in a laser tube.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
All the gases and
lasers are noble gases.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:10%
How does a laser work?

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It injects photons into the gas.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And as the noble gases
absorb these photons,

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
they get excited.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Then they couple with
other noble gases.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then together, they
give off photons of light

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:90%
as laser light.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it also applies
to us as humans.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
When we become enlightened
noble gases, guess what?

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We, too, will hook up
with another noble gas,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
another individual who
is also in balance.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
As we come together as two
perfectly balanced individuals,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that relationship is a
fabulous relationship.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because each individual is
still an independent element,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
but they find that coming
together enhances them,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:90%
energizes them.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:90%
They give off laser light.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So the relevance is this.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
How can we learn
to spin in balance?

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, well, how
come we're not in balance?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.070 align:middle line:10%
We go back to the first
seven years of programming,

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:10%
and many of those programs
take us out of balance.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know is
we can go back and change

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:90%
those programs.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back and
change those programs and we

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
ourselves learn how to
become in perfect balance,

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
we will then reflect
that noble gas.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll be enlightened.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We will not be affected
by those around us.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:10%
But what we will have
tracked is other individuals

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:10%
in perfect balance.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And when two people in
perfect balance come together,

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:90%
it's not co-dependency.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
They're there because
together, they

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:84%
create more energy and life
than when they're separated.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Couples in perfect
balance give off light

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and change the world
in which we live.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is our intention.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
If we understand the
nature of the fractal

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and see how atoms can
live in perfect balance

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and give off light and energy,
we can do the very same thing.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of
understanding a fractal

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and using the fractal analogies
to create a better life for us

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The significance of that
even extends further,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
because what we now recognize
is to spin in perfect balance

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
really is reflecting something
about our consciousness,

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
creating a consciousness
that is in harmony

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with the life around us.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, relevance of all
that is when we come back

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:84%
in our next episode, we're
going to actually talk

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:84%
about how
consciousness is really

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
influencing the evolution
of people on this planet.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in our next
and final episode,

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:84%
we will use nature's
fractal geometry

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to gain a new insight on
the mechanism of evolution.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
