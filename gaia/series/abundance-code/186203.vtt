00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The clearer we get
about that more, then

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:90%
everything else can fall away.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I think what happens
is we get in touch with what's

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
true and what's real and what
our heart really longs for.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I personally believe
that we need each other.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, I was taught
not to need anybody, that--

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, need yourself and
rely on yourself, and maybe

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:90%
your family.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And I need other people.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I know I need other
people on my team.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to be
on other people's teams.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We're seeing more and more
individuals who are actually

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
responding far more to not
where they're the victim,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.888 align:middle line:90%
but where they're the hero.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It's where, I like
that idea, and I'm

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
going to share that
with Frank, because I

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.625 align:middle line:84%
know that could be really
valuable for that person there.

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You see that a lot of
wealthy people, truly,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
truly abundant people
who are in that space,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
where they don't have
anything to prove.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's so beautiful that
when you meet those people,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:90%
they're so genuine.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
They're so authentic.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
They're not trying
to prove anything.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They're very generous, but
they're generous with wisdom.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It's mixed with
wisdom, because they

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:90%
have learned to be discerning.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
They have learned that there
are people that you can give

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and give and give to, and it's
like putting sand down a rat

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
hole, because those people
don't-- they aren't in a space

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to receive and then do something
with what they've received.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, when you're
giving to those people,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the people who aren't
in the space to receive,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:90%
what they receive weakens them.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't strengthen them.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so discernment from
the space of abundance

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
is understanding how to
give to other people,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
how to serve other
people, and who's

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
serving will help them to
expand, and who's serving

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:90%
will weaken them.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And you don't serve people
who you would weaken.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we have this healthy
relationship with giving

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
as much as we can, we will
receive more than we ever

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:90%
thought humanly possible.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When you become abundant,
there's two things you do.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
One is when things are
going great, you give help.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And when things are going
bad, you ask for help.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's powerful to
have a mentor and be a guide.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not lost in
just being a guide.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just lost in
just being a mentor.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But I have a receive and give
role, receive and give role,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:90%
receive and give role.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
To me, when that
circle is complete,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:84%
then my learning through
my mentors magnifies.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And then what I am learning
and get to share with others,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.185 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to be formal.

00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be through a chat.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It could be over a coffee.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It could be through
simple advice.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It could be through the
demonstration of how you act

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:90%
and how you live.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
That sharing of your being is
going to influence other people

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:90%
That completes the circuit.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We had one group who met
weekly for an entire year

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:90%
on the phone.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:10%
And the whole focus
of the phone call

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:10%
was to identify these limiting
beliefs that they all had

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:10%
and to change them and
to work with each other.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:10%
And it was incredible to
see how every single one

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:10%
of these people's lives changed
in terms of them attracting

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:10%
more wealth into
their lives, having

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:10%
happier family relationships,
and also having

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:10%
higher self-esteem and feeling
better about themselves.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:10%
So it's a good idea
to form a mastermind

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:10%
or get with other people who
are like-minded like you,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:10%
and really work to create
positive change together.

so individualistic that

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:90%
they're doing this on an island.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You do want to get out
and find a new village

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to be part of, a new
community to be part of.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having to do
it all yourself and make up

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:90%
every role yourself.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's really more about
finding the other people

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
on this planet whose
values resonate

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
better with what you're doing
than where you were before.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When we know who we
are and what we value,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and then we start looking for
a community in alignment with

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
those values, in alignment
with our belief systems,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%
then the world is open to us.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%

It's not about that really.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It's about receiving.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the purpose of
money is to be a good receiver

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and to let life
really, really love me.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The flip side to that is to

You don't get how

exciting things about moving

00:17:48.075 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's not to prove.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It's to share, which is about
service, to help, to give.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So he reframed his intention
from to prove into to share.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, he relaxed.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It was about service.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:90%
It was about giving.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It was about helping,
providing information to people

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:90%
who didn't have that before.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So it made him feel better.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:90%
It made them feel.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Better and it made the
speech transcendent.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people look at
power, the concept of power,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
as a pushing of force,
striving, looking at power as--

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
well, we often see
it in corporations.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Powerful people are--
they push people.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
They make things happen.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
They get things done.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
That's force.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Power is an internal
state of being.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Power, if you look at
the laws of energy,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:84%
power is the accept
of the openness

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
to allow things to
flow, to flow out

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
in a responsible,
disciplined, courageous way,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and to flow back in
an accepting, open,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:90%
willing-to-receive way.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's true power.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, power is about,
how many people can I help?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:90%
How many people can I--

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
can I take this hand and
stretch it out to another person

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and help?

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:90%
And can I scale that?

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
How many people
could I do that for?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way I
could expand that?

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
seeing power in that way,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
it became empowering
instead of being limiting.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%

when the voice and vision on
the inside really are alive,

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:90%
you wake up that celestial view.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You wake up that real calling
that gives you permission

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.345 align:middle line:90%

see that actually

instead of having, having,
having in order to be,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
what if we started
with the being?

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
What if we said today, I'm
going to be a loving person.

your mind, because changing your
mind and choosing a new path is

00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
a quick and easy
thing sometimes.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.472 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people
think that change is really hard

00:20:29.472 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and change is something
you have to strive for.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I know I spent a lot of years
striving, striving, striving,

striving.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And all it got me
was exhaustion.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I changed.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't change much at all.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I kept myself so busy so
I wouldn't have to change.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it wasn't
in the striving.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:90%
It was in the letting go.

That's what I have
to say about that.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It's much simpler than what
anyone makes it out to be.

self-help and self-development

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who laughs in yoga?

Everyone's so
serious about yoga.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:90%
But years ago, I took a class.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It was just great, because there
was a lot of laughing in it,

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:10%
When we couldn't get a
position or the teacher

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:10%
was explaining something, and
it was such a freeing class,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:10%
because it didn't have
to be so self-important.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a great sign.

All the time, he's
always laughing.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
shows you that you

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to laugh at
yourself more than anything.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much all the
real big spiritual

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
teachers, they all
laugh at themselves

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and tell stories
about themselves

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%

things they did

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.403 align:middle line:84%

>> One of my favorite
quotes, business quotes,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
is from Paul Newman, who
said, "Always take the work

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Never take yourself seriously."

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
great motto to live by.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The more you can approach
your life, your friends,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
your community, and yourself
with some openheartedness

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%

go out there and be great,

meaning go out and
get help, right?

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And ask for help, and recognize
that we're all connected.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So the more we help
each other move forward,

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
the better off the system gets,
and the system gets better.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%

better, we all get better.

Be flexible about what
the path is going to be.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So on the one side,
you are unwaveringly

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:84%
stubborn that there is a path
and you're going to find it.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
side, it keeps

If you can keep those two

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> My experience of
abundance is everything,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
literally everything,
is different.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't look at anything
the same as I did.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I get to hang out with
the people I want.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
I get to have the
clients I want.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:10%
I get to fire the clients
that I don't want,

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:10%
which is an amazing thing.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So I get to work
with who I want.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I get to work with the
team members I want.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I get to reward people
with what I want.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Abundance, for me, means
sharing whatever resources I

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
have without worrying whether
I'm going to be paid back

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:84%
for whatever I share, and just
letting that go and giving

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
my generosity, and trusting
that the universe will take care

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, money, abundance is
really a way to purchase life

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:90%
experiences on this Earth plane.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the highest
purpose of money

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
is to purchase more life
experiences on this Earth

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So recognize money is
not there to hoard.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not a thing to protect
you, to put walls around you,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to keep you separate
from others.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
there to elevate you

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
so that you can have
safety and distance

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and keep away from the masses.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
For me, abundance, as it
relates to money and earning,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is all about what is
in my soul that I wish

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:90%
to experience in this world.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out there are two
clear research findings from

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
money and happiness
correlations.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
One is if you have
experiences with your money,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:84%
if you use them to create
experiences and have

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
experiences, like
go on vacation,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and have a great time, that--

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:90%
money makes a difference there.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
If you use money to buy
experience that moves you

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's meaningful.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.158 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
is if you give it away.

00:27:12.158 --> 00:27:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That is if you're
generous with your money,

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.492 align:middle line:84%
if you're charitable
with your money,

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:17.310 align:middle line:84%
if you help other
people with your money.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:84%
That clearly raises
happiness levels.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Abundance exists.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller said that
right here on this planet

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
you've got every
single thing we say

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.637 align:middle line:84%
is a problem is not a problem
from the point of view

00:27:29.637 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:90%
that we have enough of it.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
There's enough food, but
people are still hungry.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
There's enough teachers,
but there's still not

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
enough education.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.248 align:middle line:84%
There's enough drugs or
cures, but we still end up

00:27:38.248 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:84%
with health care being
one of the biggest issues.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So every one of these issues
is a distribution issue.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not something distributed.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's not because the
technology is not there,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.883 align:middle line:84%
it's because the human
consciousness has not

00:27:47.883 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
caught up with technology to be
able to harness it effectively.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.327 align:middle line:84%
So this is not a
challenge of abundance

00:27:52.327 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that the world doesn't
have abundance.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge that we
ourselves collectively

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness
have not shifted

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to an abundant mindset, which
allows us to then actually use

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
all these resources that
are waiting for us to be

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
able to share, to be able
to connect together and make

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:90%
it happen.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, abundance is having
a total connection with this

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:84%
loving, supportive, nurturing
energy that comes through me,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to
work through me,

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and manifest however it wants
to manifest to heal the world.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The most amazing thing
is when you live abundantly,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
you inspire others
to live abundantly.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And that inspiration, that shift
in mindset is there is nothing

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.725 align:middle line:90%
more-- nothing--

00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:36.600 align:middle line:84%
there is no higher
purpose you could possibly

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
have in this world than
inspiring someone else.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you can inspire
abundance in someone else,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:90%
that has amazing ripples.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So for me, it's
abundance in time,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
abundance in appreciation,
abundance in money--

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:90%
that's nice, too--

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:90%
abundance in energy, health.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
All these areas
where there's enough.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:90%
There's enoughness.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Abundance is one of those
words that's very hard to grasp

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in a practical setting.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So to put it in a
day to day example,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
it's letting someone in
line in front of you.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not panicking
about the time.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It's seeing someone else having
success or reading about it

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and saying, that's great,
and I can have that, too.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's saying a kind
word to someone.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at yourself in the
mirror and saying, all right,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.740 align:middle line:90%
we're OK.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling a sense
of freedom and movement

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and
not a tightness.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling joy
instead of fear.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling free
instead of caged.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The more flow,
the more abundance.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The more abundance,
the more peace.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.866 align:middle line:90%
The more peace, the more love.

00:30:05.866 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
The more love,
there's more truth.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The more truth,
it's just nature.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So you are abundance.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.786 align:middle line:90%
