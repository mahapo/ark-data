00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We've created these
little pockets of scarcity

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.950 align:middle line:84%
in our minds, and in
our social structures,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and in our relationships.

in life, you had to try hard.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to be faster,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not happy.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%

on other people's standards

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%

you're setting yourself up

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
for failure.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%

Even though people said

There's no higher purpose
you could possibly

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
have in this world than
inspiring someone else.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you can inspire
abundance in someone else,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
that has amazing ripples.

poetry, great music,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
great accomplishment in business

It's simpler, easier.

in today's lesson.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
They're more interested in
why chickens cross roads.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, class, it's very
important for you

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
you're not here for fun.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
You're here to learn.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow the rules
and learn well at school,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:90%
then you'll succeed in life.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Do we know what succeed means?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.472 align:middle line:90%

00:03:50.472 --> 00:03:52.508 align:middle line:90%

to learn anything.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they
will be failures.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.028 align:middle line:84%
Do we know what
failures are, class?

00:04:04.028 --> 00:04:05.492 align:middle line:90%

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are we so
captivated by abundance?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:10%
I think it's because we are
afraid that somehow we're

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.675 align:middle line:10%
on our own, that we're going to
have to make do with what we've

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:10%
got, and that
we're going to have

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:10%
to struggle through the
journey of life by ourselves.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in abundance
because we want to know,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:90%
are we loved?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
That's basically it.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Are we loved?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Does life love us?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Does that which created us,
whatever we want to call it,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
does it love us?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.276 align:middle line:90%
Does it care?

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:10%
>> The problem we have in
society that success is

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:10%
measured either
by fame or money.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:10%
It really is.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:10%
Who has the shiniest toys, who
has the most money in the bank

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:10%
account.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is
just an indicator

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:90%
of money and financial success.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So success is so much
deeper than that.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>> We have now an entire
generation of victims.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Because our entire
media has used

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.797 align:middle line:10%
that as a way to be able to
create desire and demand.

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
What's your problem?

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's the problem.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're not even sure this
is your problem, believe me,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:90%
it's your problem.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:90%
This is why this is a problem.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.585 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, my gosh,
I need that medicine.

00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:29.145 align:middle line:90%
I need that gym equipment.

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is people
then end up in this fear,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.817 align:middle line:84%
like if I don't have it,
I'm going to remain broken.

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:35.233 align:middle line:84%
Because you've
told me I'm broken.

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And I can see why.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:90%
So now, I'm broken.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:10%
>> We've created a world
that's very fast paced.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And there are very high
expectations of everyone.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And we can't keep up.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:90%
People aren't able to keep up.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the response to
that is dysfunction.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So the current system that's
in place around the world is

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:90%
about competition, separation.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.702 align:middle line:84%
But it could be
about cooperation,

00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:00.035 align:middle line:84%
but we have to elevate the
consciousness of the species.

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:08.214 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> From a very, very early age,
we start to get messages about

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
everything-- messages about who
we are, messages about life,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
messages about love,
messages about happiness,

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
messages about abundance, and
of course, messages about money.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this idea
where people need to play

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:10%
by the rules comes often
out of our childhoods,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.742 align:middle line:10%
where in our family's system
it was the way to behave.

00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we learned how to
behave in that system,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:90%
and it actually worked.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was the best
choice we could possibly make.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older,
that way of behaving

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.665 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily fit
in the bigger world.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have to really
identify that and begin

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:90%
to drop those things off.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when we have
formed a concept--

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and most of us have formed
a concept of who we are

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and what life is about
by the age of 10.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we've literally
got this 10-year-old

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:90%
running our life for us.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like I
remember my parents.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, we'd
go to parties, right?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd be five years old,
and we'd play party games.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.355 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it's like.

00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:90%
You'd be there at the game.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.502 align:middle line:90%
And the music starts.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's dancing.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like, how cool is this?

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.103 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is dancing.

00:07:19.103 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And so now you're dancing.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
the music stops.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
And so jump in the chair.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.512 align:middle line:90%
And everyone gets in the chair.

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
Johnny didn't get a chair.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's like, oh.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And Johnny is being sent
off the dance floor,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.652 align:middle line:90%

00:07:34.652 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you see
them take another chair away.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.193 align:middle line:84%
And you realize there's
not enough chairs.

00:07:39.193 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:90%
And so now, you're watching.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually
getting close to the chair,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
just in case it stops.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And no one's even
dancing properly anymore.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the music stops
and straightaway we're

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
just jumping in again.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
And now, there's Jane.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And I love Jane.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
push her anyway,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%
because I need the chair.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm in the chair.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And this keeps on going.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.917 align:middle line:84%
And they keep on
taking the chairs away.

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And we keep on fighting
over the chair that's left.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's a game.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.365 align:middle line:90%
And it's lack.

00:07:59.365 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
point where you're

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
five years old that you're
actually getting taught this.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And we then blame
the education system.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We blame other
things as to why we

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
feel that lack when, in fact,
it's at the core of our being,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:39.394 align:middle line:10%
in life, you had to try hard.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
You had to be faster,
smarter, better, that there

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of scarcity in the
world, a lot of limitation,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of suffering, that
you could be kicked out

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of your house, not
have enough to eat,

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%

weren't on top of it,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.525 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't have a
really good education,

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%

really, really hard.

any kind of money, wealth.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
very middle-class,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.196 align:middle line:90%
working class background.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
My parents did not have
ultra-enlightened or empowered

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:90%
ideas about money.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the things that were
passed along was the whole idea

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:10%
of money doesn't grow on trees,
and that you really do have

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:10%
to--

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:10%


00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:10%
we were always looking
for ways to save money,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:10%
for ways to not waste,
for ways to be frugal.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
how I ended up

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
in my 20s going to the
grocery store and not one

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to put a twist tie
on the plastic bag.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:10%
Because when you
got to the scale,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:10%
that twist tie would
weigh another hundredth

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:10%
of an ounce or something.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to pay
more money for it.

>> I found my mom's budget
from when we were growing up.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And on the budget, it started
with the money she made.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the very bottom,
it ended up at zero.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And she even counted
in the cost to send

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:90%
stamps to send the bill.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And the stamps were $0.13.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how much money.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
We had none basically left
at the end of each month.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
very, very prosperous, I had
pretty much everything I could

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want for anything.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then later in life
when I was about 11,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:90%
my parents broke up.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:10%
And within a couple of
years of breaking up,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:10%
somehow all the money was gone.

when I was in my early teens.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Got in trouble with the law.

Got in trouble in school.

where we did things
that were illegal.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was where I fit in.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I felt good with these kids.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%

And I started--

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:46.985 align:middle line:84%
I left home when I
was 13, 14 years old.

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%

around the illusion that I was

>> I thought you weren't
supposed to want money.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:84%
You weren't supposed
to care about money.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:10%
And what's weird is because
I wasn't paying attention

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:10%
to money and because I
was trying not to have it,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:10%
I spent almost all my
time thinking about money,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:10%
because I didn't have it.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid my car
would break down.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Or I wouldn't be able to
eat or whatever it may be.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I really was
desperate at times.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And I started searching
for this abundance code.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:90%
What is it for me?

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I wanted it all.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Even though people said
you can't have it all,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
you can't have a
great relationship,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
you can't have great
health, you can't

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.220 align:middle line:84%
have time freedom to enjoy
the pleasures of life,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
just the pleasures
of life, and you

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.990 align:middle line:84%
can't have a deep spiritual
life and be abundant,

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.475 align:middle line:84%
I decided that I wanted
to be the exception.

00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And finally, I just
got so tired of that.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought, if a
person is not supposed

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
to be caring about money,
I'm thinking about it way,

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:90%
way too much.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to master money.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the place where
money is just not an issue.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I had these values, I
can do things for other people.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I can contribute
to other people.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And I won't have to just-- oh,
I have to keep so much for me,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:90%
because I don't have enough.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in fear and
scarcity about everything.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Fear rules us when
we're in scarcity.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a place where
we feel like we're

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
in constant competition,
where we're in adversity,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:90%
where we have to hoard.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So every thought that you
have is motivated by fear,

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
which means it's going to
be greed, jealousy, envy,

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:90%
all of these different things--

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:90%
selfishness.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you're coming
from that survival brain.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
You're coming from a brain
that's saying, it's me or them.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:27.665 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.665 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:10%
>> In the culture of more,
something happens where we move

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:10%
from being to having.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.777 align:middle line:84%
Now, this shift
from being to having

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting one.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we tell ourselves that
if I have more, if I get more,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I'll be happy.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll be gorgeous.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.723 align:middle line:90%
I'll be kind.

00:19:48.723 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll be compassionate.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:90%
You watch.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll just be amazing.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The problem is in the culture
of more, we want more.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's never
enough, ultimately.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:90%
We've never defined enough.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, any time a person
is not living authentically

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
according to what is truly
most important, and meaningful,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and value, and inspiring
in their lives,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.615 align:middle line:84%
the unfulfillment makes them
seek immediate gratification

00:20:11.615 --> 00:20:12.995 align:middle line:90%
to compensate.

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Going to work on
Monday, getting to Friday,

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
like I used to do, being
really excited for Friday,

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and then self-medicating again
till Monday, and then wash,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:90%
rinse, repeat.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, I ate, and
I watched movies on TV.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was what I used to do.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got home,
I'd start eating junk food

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and watching whatever
was on cable TV.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I would just check out.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.265 align:middle line:84%
Any chance I could to
check out, I was gone.

00:20:40.265 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think to get
through that time--

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%
I look back now.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well, I
probably had some depression

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
a little bit going on.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a typical
life experience for me.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also think I
soothed myself by,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
you're just numb, by
numbing myself and doing

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that in a variety of ways that
I don't think are helpful.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole time
I was doing this,

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I was also gaining weight.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:10%
So over an 11-year period,
I gained over 200 pounds.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.434 align:middle line:10%
I went from about 180
pounds to 409 pounds.

00:21:19.434 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It's critically important
for people to understand that

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
distractions are
controlling them.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And distractions are a really
handy way not to face life.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It's what many people do.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
It's why during a difficult
period, entertainment thrives.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You see movie houses opening
up all over the place.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And even if you go back
to the Great Depression,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.468 align:middle line:84%
the one industry that thrived
through the Great Depression

00:21:47.468 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:90%
was the entertainment industry.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Because people can
distract themselves.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not looking
at the problems,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.705 align:middle line:84%
then maybe the
problems will go away.

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they don't go
away until we handle them,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
until we do
something about them.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's critically
important that we

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:84%
understand how damaging buying
into those distractions are.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the easy thing to do, but
it's not the wise thing to do.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So the things
that surround us,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the people that surround us,
the news or inputs that we get,

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:90%
the kind of stuff we read--

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
what you take in really
can influence what belief.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're in
scarcity, whether you're

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
in fear, whether you're in
abundance, whether you're

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
in generosity, it's
really important, I think,

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
to be careful about that.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Every hour of time that I
waste is an hour I can never

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:90%
get back.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.927 align:middle line:84%
With money, I can
always get more.

00:22:50.927 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But with time-- when it's
gone, it's gone forever.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.808 align:middle line:84%
The moment you just confront
that and say it's gone forever

00:22:57.808 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's never coming back,
I must make the most of it.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
What could I be doing
with that hour right now?

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:90%
You do stop watching the TV.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.497 align:middle line:84%
You do stop actually
procrastinating.

00:23:05.497 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
You do stop actually
saying it's OK for this

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:90%
to happen for another day.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.325 align:middle line:84%
And you do say, no, it's
going to change now.

00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Recognize, wow, I
got caught up in that.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I got caught up in that
relationship stuff.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I got caught up in that gossip.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I got caught up in
that reality TV show.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I got caught up in
that rag magazine--

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:84%
who's zooming who, who's having
sex with who, who's breaking up

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:90%
with who, who's loving who.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Relax importance.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, too much
importance on that.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm riled up.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And this addictive behavior,
this hedonic treadmill trying

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to find this instant
gratification and pleasure

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:84%
makes people sometimes try
to be somebody they're not,

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:90%
which is a vicious cycle.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.126 align:middle line:84%
>> When you play the game
by someone else's rules,

00:23:58.126 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:90%
you're so off.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And you're sacrificing family.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing
relationships.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.695 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing your
relationship with yourself.

00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing
relationship with--

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the natural world
is a big one for me.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Your community, with
your spiritual self.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So often when you get
stuck in those boxes,

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't allow you to live
your biggest, fullest life.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have an
abundance of something.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Many people have an abundance
of things they don't want.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.503 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to discover the
path, the right combination,

00:24:29.503 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you have an abundance
of things you do want.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the game really
working for you?

00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thing.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see people-- more
people step back and just

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:84%
observe, say, is this
really working for me?

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Do I have the
relationships I want?

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Do I have the physical
body that I want?

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Do I have the life
I really want?

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And I see it happening a lot,

seemed like a gentleman that

had his whole life together.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And my brother had arranged for
a meeting between Alan and I.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And he proceeded to ask me
a bunch of questions about,

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.925 align:middle line:84%
why did I think that I
was getting into trouble?

What did I think was going
to happen with my life?

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:90%

What were my dreams?

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But I had to have
a job as a front

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
so that my parents would think
that the money that I had

was coming from
legitimate means.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:90%

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Why did I think I was
doing these things?

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:90%

Aren't you aware that
you can become more?

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%

build your confidence
