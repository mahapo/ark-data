Is this how it is cause
this place of constraint

>> Very few people have taken
the time to really go deep

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%

joy and happiness in my life?

anybody else says,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.607 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what
the media says,

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what my parents
said or your parents said

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
or your brothers or
sisters or friends--

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
what would it mean for me to
be happy and to be successful?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That questionnaire
will lead us and direct us

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:90%
in a non-linear way--

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
in a non-linear way to
the exact precise person,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
place, situation that will give
us the next step, and that's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
what we need to know and follow
that next step with action.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Then our questioning
will mature because we

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
listen to our questioner.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%

with more confidence to us.

me was seeing the pattern,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and that's so important.

>> Awareness is the first
thing that we have to do.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to be aware
that you are in a system

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and be to step back from that.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
or if you notice that you
have a problem in any aspect

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of your life or your business
that once you start noticing

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that pattern, you're going to
start seeing it repeated over

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and over again and just
paying attention, doing,

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and naming the problem can help
you just as much as anything.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever you feel
trapped, drained,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:84%
like you in a vicious cycle or
on the wheel, the treadmill,

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like there's
just it's not going anywhere.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.955 align:middle line:90%
You're not making progress.

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
You're banging your
head against the wall.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The wisest thing
I can tell you is

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to first go through
and determine

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:84%
what's truly your
life is demonstrating

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:90%
it's valuable to you.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Not somebody else's expectation,
but what's your life

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate that
you spontaneously

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
are inspired from within to
do and start looking at what's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
really valuable to you.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> When I got that, I
started asking myself,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
what is my abundance?

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to me?

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I started asking
that with real inquiry,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
real genuineness,
almost a yearning

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
for my heart for a
deeper happiness,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I started getting clues.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I started getting the right
people would come along.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
The right book would come along.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:90%
The right mentor would show up.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.755 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you have a job
and you're working your job

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
not happy in the job,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
but you know you
can't just quit.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You know you need that money
to support your family.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you do as you
support your family

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But every day, you go home
for an hour or two hours,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and you work on your passion,
your hobby, what you love.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If we begin to shift our
own mindset towards abundance

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and towards thinking not
about how we're limited,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
not about how our lives
are mired in scarcity.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
If we start going to how
can I be abundant right now,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:90%
what do I have to give?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Can I offer comfort to
someone who needs it?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Can I give kindness?

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Can I be present to someone
who's in pain emotionally

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:90%
or physically?

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:84%
If we start to go to
those types of abundance

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
that we can access, then
that's a place to start.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The only real power we
have is the power of choice.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The only real power
we have is the power

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of what I choose to focus
on, what I choose to think,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
what I choose to feel.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think abundance is not only
a mindset but a choice that we

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:90%
make again and again daily.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Every interaction,
every opportunity,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
every exchange we have is like a
Y. And you can choose scarcity,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:90%
or you can choose abundance.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We have two ways
to approach life.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:84%
One is competitively,
and one is cooperatively.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And they are mutually exclusive.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
You're either competing,
or you're cooperating.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have been sold
the idea that competition

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:90%
is how you succeed.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
It's how you get to the top.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to climb over everybody

>> Find a way to move out of
scarcity and into abundance.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to get to
that sense of enoughness,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:90%
the sense of alrightness.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:90%

>> For me, for many years, I
was stuck on a very frustrating

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:10%
cycle of creating
wealth and losing it,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:10%
creating wealth and losing it.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
cycle was very busy.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:90%
It was very energy-consuming.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It was very
all-consuming, really.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I realized that cycle

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
had its roots in
my belief system

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that I was reenacting the
experience I had as a child

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
where my family was
very prosperous,

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and then they lost it all.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I was just reenacting it
over and over and over again

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because that was how I
believed the world was.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
That was how I believed it went.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> For some reason,
I had this feeling--

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is in my early,
mid-20s even into my 30s--

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
where I thought that
the less stuff I had,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:90%
the better person I was.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So if I could get by with
fewer things, then I would--

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
just maybe wholly or whatever--
made me a better person.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big part of my
life to the point where I would

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:90%
actually judge other people.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Like if they had a
big fancy car and I

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
had just a serviceable
car, I was a better person

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:90%
than they were.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.813 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of
funny because I think

00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
most people in
this world, there's

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that judge
others by their possessions.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Like I've got these things,
so I'm better than you.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:10%
And that's sort
of the common way

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of people, I
think, sort of grow up.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
a horrible way to be,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
but the funny thing is I was
just the flip side of that.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time
to figure that out.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was a time when
I was dating a guy who was not

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:90%
a healthy person for me.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It was caustic.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
It was full of outbursts
and ruptures and fights.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
feeling not worthy,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that whatever the fight was,
it was my fault at the root.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a
while to disengage

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:90%
from that relationship.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It was very tough.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It went on and off and on
and on for 2 and 1/2 years,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
and I finally extracted myself.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I saw an old boyfriend,
one of those old boyfriends

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that you stay friends with
who still cares for you.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, as I broke down, there
were all these wrong things

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
about me, and I
needed to get help.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, what if
there's nothing wrong with you?

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was such an
eye-opening possibility.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It never occurred to
me that was an option.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I needed to work on things.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I need to
progress and grow.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that at
my core that I was not

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally wrong was
such a beautiful concept.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember sobbing
and been so grateful,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:90%
and it was really an epiphany.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most amazing
things that happened to me was

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:90%
when I did leave--

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
when I did make the transition
to calling my own shots.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I talked to a woman.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman who
absolutely literally

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
would negotiate a $100 million
contract before breakfast.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.948 align:middle line:90%
That's not an exaggeration.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at
me and said, I wish

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:90%
I could do what you're doing.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh man, if you
don't believe in yourself,

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the most
capable people I've ever met.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Then it's not about
actually being capable.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
It's about believing in
yourself, which is a skill

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and can be learned.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%
That was a revelation for me.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:90%
That was a touchstone for me.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Your beliefs about abundance,
your beliefs about money,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:10%
your beliefs about self,
about what you deserve,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:10%
about how your life should be--

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:10%
these are like the
roots of a tree,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:10%
and your knowledge
and your action

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.675 align:middle line:10%
in the world, that's like
the branches and the leaves.

00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:10%
If you want to grow
a good tree, if you

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:10%
want to grow some
fruit, a fruitful life,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't water the leaves.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's what a
lot of us tend to do.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We go out and we
do a lot of action,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or we acquire a
lot of knowledge.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And we think that
that's how we're

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:10%
going to get a fruitful life.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:10%
And we're just
watering the leaves.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:10%
We don't go down into the
roots, examine the roots,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:10%
if we don't nurse the soil
within which the roots are

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:10%
sitting and make sure that the
beliefs that everything rests

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:10%
upon are stable, they're
congruent with what

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:10%
we want to achieve.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:10%
And they're going to
provide the foundation,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:10%
the strong foundation for
our tree of abundance.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:10%
If we don't do that, then
we can't grow that tree,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:10%
and we cannot access the
abundant life that we really

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:10%
want.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Can I bring myself
to thinking and feeling

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:10%
and believing and doing
something a little bit

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:10%
different?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:90%
The answer is everybody can.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we start with
what you can do.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we start with what
I call microyeses,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%
microcommitments to change.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:10%
>> And what I like to tell
people is just focus on 1%

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:10%
improvement.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.608 align:middle line:10%
If you just work on 1%
improvement every day,

00:14:04.608 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:10%
your life's going to
get better, and you're

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:10%
going to become more abundant.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start to
work on your thoughts,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and things are going to change.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Listen to positive things,
change the thought process.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> They say that there's 10,000
thoughts that you think every

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
single day, and most of them are
of the same negative ones over

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
and over.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you started noticing
some of those negative thoughts

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that you're saying and changing
the positive thoughts or change

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
negative behavior to
a positive behavior,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.017 align:middle line:84%
then you can change a lot
of things in your life.

00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's amazing how much we
as humans every day constantly

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:10%
surprise ourselves that we're
still in the same situation

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.503 align:middle line:10%
than yesterday.

00:14:40.503 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Without realizing
that any moment,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:84%
we can just say
this is necessary.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We can actually be a
very different person.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.575 align:middle line:10%
>> The good news is the
brain can change at any time.

00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:10%
So if you jump
out of that groove

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:10%
and if you challenge
those old beliefs,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:10%
old patterns, old environments,
you get into new environments.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:90%
You can change.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.976 align:middle line:84%
So the past is an advisor,
not a determinant.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:10%

doing mischievous things.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:10%
And that was when we had

about the band that's playing or
the research being talked about

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
or the political situation
or the health tip of the day.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.520 align:middle line:84%
We start to feel this
self-aware conscious

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:90%
that I don't know that.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And we equated I don't know
with I'm not good enough.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not smart enough.

right before.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's just really sad.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of the problem is
they didn't have the clarity,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't have
enough of the why.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't
have the motivation

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
because, at the end of the
day, nobody can motivate you.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.208 align:middle line:90%
I can't motivate you.

00:19:30.208 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
going to motivate you

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
is that internal engine
that's inside this

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:90%
is why I'm doing it.

>> So when you're
devoted to your craft,

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:90%
you're devoted to your art.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.872 align:middle line:90%
You're devoted to your mission.

00:19:40.872 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:10%
It's not about discipline.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
It's about a place of love.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You trade your life
for what you love.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find is
you'll meet other people who

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
are trading their life
for what they love,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.003 align:middle line:84%
and that will become
your circle of friends.

00:19:55.003 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a bunch of
people who are trading in life

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
or what they love and they
suspend judgment on what you're

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
doing or what you're not doing.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And you suspend judgment
on what they're doing

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:90%
or what they should be doing.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, all of
the idiosyncrasies go away.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:90%
All of the judgment goes away.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
All of the blame, shame,
and guilt goes away,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're all of
a sudden in bliss.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you surround yourself
with people that are in bliss,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
you actually accentuate
your own bliss,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and you just create
a life that you're

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
smiling more than
you're sad, and you're

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%
happy more than you're mad.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're fulfilled
more than you're not.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
You feel like your life is
worth trading for what you do,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and that to me is success.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what happens as we
get older is we start shaving

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:90%

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:84%
If we have parts
of ourselves that

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
don't fit into the outside
mold of a mother, a father,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
an insurance salesman,
and a professional, CEO,

whatever it is you
do, you think, well,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:90%
that's not the way they do it.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So maybe my way's wrong, or
maybe this style is wrong.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm a mom, I'm
supposed to bake cookies.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't ride a Harley.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm an executive, I
shouldn't talk about my days

in my jazz band.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
happens in that process

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.635 align:middle line:90%
is that we dim our light.

00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:10%
>> People have different
reactions to our growth.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes when we grow,
we move away from people

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:10%
because we're stretching
ourselves in new ways.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And some people are supportive
of that and excited for us,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and other people are
afraid with that.

You might actually

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:10%
You might start to
gain some friendships,

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:10%
or the actual nature of your
friendship might change.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:90%

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:84%
a better car than that
guy who disrespected you,

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:84%
which was a motivator
for me for a while.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and I do have a
better car than that guy.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a great place to be.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:90%
You do get there.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It frees a lot of
your energy, and it

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.702 align:middle line:84%
creates a lot of spaciousness
and a lot of calm.

00:22:31.702 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:90%
But it takes some time.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think you should
enjoy the whole journey

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and not try and
leapfrog to that place.

experiences a dark night

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, but
I'm here to tell you

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
there is any such thing

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:90%
as a dark night of the soul.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a dark
night of the soul.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a dark night of the ego.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is an important
distinction to make.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
The soul, your true
essence, our true essence,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:90%
is doing very, very well.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Our ego, our self-image
can be on its knees.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It can be crushed.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It can be at the
end of the road.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And although that feels
like a terrible thing,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
herein is our great
opportunity because truly

the next level of success,
the next level of abundance,

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:84%
the next level of happiness,
the next level of love

wasn't like anything changed

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But I had a vision, and that
vision is one that I've kept.

level is your new comfort zone.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
take another step,

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.053 align:middle line:84%
and you can step out and get
comfortable at that level.

00:26:39.053 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
your comfort zone

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
just keeps expanding and
expanding and expanding.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And you now are living fully.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Being able to be
uncomfortable and being able

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to be uncertain without filling
that up immediately with buying

00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
something, eating something,
going somewhere, working out.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have our ways
of filling that space.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Being able to be spacious
around uncertainty

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is not something that most of
us have much practice with.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you
it is a practice.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
It is a skill that can
be learned with practice.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It is not something
that you should

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
expect to be naturally good at.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.985 align:middle line:84%
You won't be, but you get
better as you practice it.

00:27:24.985 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard somebody
say the other day--

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I love this phrase--

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I've become a not know at all.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know at all.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And then they're at that place.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead of this you
know scary uncertainty,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:90%
there is this open uncertainty.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:90%
It's like I'm willing to be led.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to get a new dream.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to not
know for a while

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and then to notice
what shows up,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
what comes through
me, what comes to me,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:90%
what the world invites me to.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Bucky Fuller used to say, what's
wanted and needed in the world?

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the zen saying
start with the beginner's mind.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Start by asking yourself what
you need to unlearn in order

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to learn again?

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to empty out
in terms of fears, emotions

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
in terms of knowledge of
what you think can or can't

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.212 align:middle line:84%
be done so that you're actually
starting to say, hey, what if I

00:28:13.212 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:84%
just landed here
for the first time

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and I just listened to
everything for the first time?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Who's doing amazing things
where they're younger than me?

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.980 align:middle line:84%
They're maybe not
as smart as me.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
They're maybe not as
experienced as me,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and somehow, they've
gone right past me.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:84%
What were they
doing differently?

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:90%
How were they doing that?

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all
of the universe

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
opens up to us because
our cup by being empty

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
opens up the space
for everything.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as I allowed a
question without an answer,

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:84%
just allowed a question
to bubble up and be that

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
the universe responded and
brought me the teachers that I

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
needed and brought me the
information that I needed

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and brought me the
resources that I needed,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
brought me everything
that I needed.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I certainly can't
say that I was left

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:84%
hanging in a void for an
inordinate amount of time,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost like I
had to be willing to hang

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I had to be willing to
hang and trust the answers

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:84%
that I needed would come,
that the path I needed to walk

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:90%
would be revealed.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I think sometimes we
have the perception--

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:10%
or I'll speak for myself.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I had the perception that when
I make the right decision,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:84%
there'll be these
clangs of affirmation,

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
like yes, you're
on the right path.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.252 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
opposite is true.

00:29:36.252 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:10%
In my experience, when
I make a decision that's

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:10%
not in my best
interests, there's

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:10%
a lot of noise in my
head, and it's actually

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:10%
when I've made a decision
that's on the right path, when

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm following what I
call my through line

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.980 align:middle line:10%
is the sense of peace.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:10%
It's quiet.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>> And so what I seek to do on
a daily basis in my meditations

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:10%
is show me.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Show me, make me more aware.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Help me see what I don't see.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Help me feel what I
don't feel right now.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:10%
Help me meet who
I haven't met yet

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:10%
right now for the fulfillment
of my spiritual journey,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:10%
for the fulfillment of
my physical journey,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.432 align:middle line:10%
emotional journey, for the
fulfillment of my life.

00:30:21.432 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember when I
met Richard Branson.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
happened in the conversation,

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, hey, what are you up to?

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And he just immediately
went into something.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, well, I
have got his challenge

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.378 align:middle line:84%
and just wondering
what's a good idea

00:30:33.378 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:90%
of what we could do about this.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Any ideas?

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, next thing, I'm
chatting to him and saying,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:84%
well, you could do this,
or you could do that.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, what
am I even doing here?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm with a billionaire.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And he obviously
has great ideas.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is he asking me?

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:46.655 align:middle line:90%
And it became very obvious.

00:30:46.655 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't attached
to his own ideas.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.370 align:middle line:84%
He'd listen to
what I had to say.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
interesting, he'd take it.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:90%
If it wasn't, it wouldn't.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.245 align:middle line:84%
But he wasn't
saying, oh my gosh,

00:30:53.245 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you my next idea
because that wasn't what he

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:90%
was holding his self-worth to.

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The terrifying part
recognizing that you have

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
the power to change your life
is not the fear of can I do it,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
but oh my goodness,
now, I am responsible,

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:90%
that you can't blame anymore.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Your situation is
not other people.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't find excuses.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's that awesome
recognition and responsibility

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.826 align:middle line:84%
that comes with being
the creator of your life.

00:31:28.826 --> 00:31:34.035 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC PLAYING] Like
the sun again, I

00:31:34.035 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:90%
will rise in this moment.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a fire.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:10%
I will feed on love for you
and tear it up right now.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:10%
Oh, can anybody
hear me out there?

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.906 align:middle line:10%
Is anyone alive out there?

00:31:54.906 --> 00:31:58.399 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:01.892 align:middle line:84%

00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:09.377 align:middle line:84%

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.864 align:middle line:10%

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the anthem for the lost.

Tell what me you want.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you want.
