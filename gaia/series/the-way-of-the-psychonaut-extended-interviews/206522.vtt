00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Archetypal astrology is a
branch of Western astrology.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually started
referring to astrologies.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
There's such a
diversity of astrologers

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
from around the world,
and archetypal astrology

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
is particularly grounded in this
understanding of archetypes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So every planet is associated
with a particular archetype,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
quality, or character that
has this spectrum of meaning.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
This multivalence of meaning, or
this multifaceted range of ways

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that it can come through when
embodied in an individual life

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
or in a human
event, and so forth.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And what perhaps differentiates
archetypal astrology

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
from other forms of
astrology is really

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
this focus on the archetypes
and its grounding in the depth

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
psychological tradition,
in archetypal psychology,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and also this philosophical
lineage of understanding

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:90%
what an archetype even is.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So within archetypal astrology,
the meaning of an archetype

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is defined by the idea
of Platonic archetypes

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
or Platonic forms, as
Plato described them

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
in his dialogues, or
Aristotelian universals.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle described
the universals

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that are inherent
to the particulars.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
They're like Whiteheadian,
Alfred North Whitehead.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
His eternal form-- or
what are they called?

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Alfred North Whitehead's
eternal objects

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that ingress into
existence, into experience,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and then they're like mythic
deities of the pantheons,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
of the mythic traditions
from around the world.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They're also like the
psychological archetypes

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:90%
that Carl Jung described.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we approach
an understanding

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
of the astrological system
and what an archetype is,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
all of these different
philosophical

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual and
psychological perspectives

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
are brought to bear
on interpreting

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
what the archetype
is and understanding

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
how it works in a
participatory relationship

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:90%
with the human psyche.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So a Platonic form or
idea is the universal

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
that we see in the particular.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So an example that Plato brings
forward is that of horse.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Think horse with a
capital H. And when

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
we see particular
horses, we recognize

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
that what is in common,
what is universal behind

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
them is this archetype or
form of horse or horseness.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And for Plato, at
least, these forms

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
all existed in an ideal
realm, the realm of forms.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And that ideal realm
was, in some sense,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
separate from the
flawed, mundane realm

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:90%
that we all live in.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
participatory relationship

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:84%
between the particular horses
and the universal form of horse

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that they are participating in.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Morphic fields are
another excellent way

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of describing what
an archetype is,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and even the way that,
with a morphic field when

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
we participate in
that, it inflects,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
it shapes how future
participants in that field

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:90%
will inhabit that.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And so morphic fields
are a great example,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
because you can see the
evolution through time,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and yet there's still
this kind of core to it.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so from the archetypal
astrological perspective,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
it's like a blend of the
Platonic ideal, which

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is eternal and unchanging,
and the morphic field,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
which is evolving through time.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And an archetype, in terms of
the astrological perspective,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:90%
it holds both.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's both eternal and evolving,
and it's evolving through us,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and yet, it's echoing back to
this eternal archetype that

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:90%
lies behind it.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So it holds both in this
paradox of the eternal

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:90%
and the evolving.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So Aristotle differed from
Plato in his understanding.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking that
the forms or the archetypes

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
were in their own ideal
separate realm, Aristotle,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
he saw them as universals that
were only part of this realm.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can conceptually
understand

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that the universal,
of course, lies behind

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
all the particular
horses we see,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
but there isn't a ideal form
that's in a separate realm

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:90%
as Plato saw it.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we see that
extraordinary painting

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of the School of Athens
that has Plato and Aristotle

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
at the center and
Plato's pointing upward

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and Aristotle's pointing out.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can see in there the
difference of their gestures

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that Plato is pointing
toward a transcendent realm,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
an ideal realm, and
Aristotle is pointing out

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
to the world around him.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
two places where

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
the universals or the forms,
the archetypes, exist.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And the archetypal astrological
perspective, I think,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
also aims to hold both
of those together,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:90%
recognizing the truth in both.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So we can look back
through history,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can see when two or more
planets come into alignment

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
These are called
transits or aspects,

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and the alignments are--
they're geometrical.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a
conjunction, where you have

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:90%
two or more planets together.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to look up
into the sky with a telescope

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or without, you would see these
two planets next to each other.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
You have the
opposition, which is--

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
it's like the full
moon position.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The conjunction is
the new moon position,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
the opposition is the
full moon position,

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and then you have part of
the same quadrature cycle.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
What's called the square,
so a 90-degree Angle

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:90%
That's your half moon.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And these relationships, these
geometrical relationships

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
are formed between
all the planets.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can look
back through history

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and see when these alignments
were coming into orb, into what

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:84%
we call the orb of
influence and see

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
how the archetypal
qualities associated

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:84%
with each one of
those planets combine.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
They inflect each other,
they influence each other

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and how those then live
through human events

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
in this sequential patterning
throughout history.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So an example is the
Uranus Pluto cycle.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And the archetype of Uranus
is associated with rebellion,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
with change, with disruption.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's the trickster.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the Promethean archetype of
stealing fire from the heavens

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and granting it as
new consciousness,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
as new awareness to humanity.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
It's that sudden spark
of insight or awakening

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:90%
or liberation.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And then Pluto, the
archetype of Pluto,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
is associated with the
depths with the underworld

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
with the chthonic, the demonic,
the terrifying, the corrupt.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's also related to
the death, rebirth mystery.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:84%
The Phoenix rising
from the ashes

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
or the process of composting.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like Kali in the Hindu
tradition of destruction

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and then creation, or Pele in
the Hawaiian of the volcanic

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.738 align:middle line:90%
dying and being reborn.

00:08:57.738 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you bring
those two together,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
these are potent
powerful archetypes,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and what one would imagine just
bringing those two archetypes

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
into combination would be some
kind of awakening or liberation

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
or unleashing of what's been
kept in the underworld of what

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is waiting to be reborn
out of what has been dying.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, every
time these two planets

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
come into alignment
into what we call

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
hard aspect, that conjunction,
the opposition or the square,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
we see it correlate with
major periods of change.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Social upheaval, revolution,
and that Uranian archetype,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
it liberates, it awakens
the Platonic elements

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
of maybe those
who've been oppressed

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
or that which has
been repressed.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example,
there was an opposition

00:09:54.270 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
of Uranus and Pluto in
the late 18th century that

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
correlated with the French
Revolution and the Haitian

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can see is themes
that come up of revolution

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and liberating the oppressed
patterned through history,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and particular strains
around women's liberation

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or civil rights or
sexual revolution

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:84%
or the psychedelic
revolution in the 1960s.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So the 1960s was one of
our most recent alignments

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:90%
of Uranus and Pluto.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Uranus and Pluto came into a
conjunction from 1960 to 1972,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and we see here the same
revolutionary themes

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
of feminism and the women's
movement, Black liberation

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and the Civil Rights movement.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We see the psychedelic
renaissance.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We see the psychedelic
revolution.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We see the beginning of
the gay rights movement.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:84%
We see the birth of the
ecological movement,

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
with the publication of
Rachel Carson's "Silent

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Spring" in 1962.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And then after that
alignment comes to an end,

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
after Uranus and Pluto are no
longer in that conjunction,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
which closed in 1972, in
some ways, those themes,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
they go underground
a bit or they

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
take different tacks and other
alignments come in and that

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
influences the
zeitgeist, the flavor

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in the collective.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the very next time
Uranus and Pluto come back

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
into alignment
together has actually

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:90%
been in the last decade.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So beginning in 2007 and it
will be lasting until 2020.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the
sunset years right now

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of the Uranus Pluto square.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So it went from the
conjunction, the 1960s,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
over to the 90-degree
angle of the square.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, we're seeing
the first Black president

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
carrying forward the themes
of the Civil Rights movement.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
We see Black Lives Matter.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Barack Obama is
actually a great example

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
of this diachronic
patterning, because he

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
was born in 1962 with the
Uranus Pluto conjunction.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
He is elected president
of the United States

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in 2008, just as
the Uranus Pluto

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
square is coming into orb, and
his presidency, in many ways,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
defines the first eight
years of that alignment.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we see the themes
around gay marriage becoming

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
legalized in the
United States or all

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of the awareness around
gender and transgender rights

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and gender fluidity how the
conversation is changing

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and so rapidly around that.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You see that
acceleration of change

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:84%
when Uranus and
Pluto come together.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It's this unleashing
of these Titanic forces

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that affect such
profound change.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So another theme associated
with Uranus Pluto

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
can be that Uranian
awakening or liberating

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Platonic
shadow, the corrupt.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the empowerment
of individualistic demagogues,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Mao in the '60s.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We see Putin and Trump and Kim
Jong-un in this current era.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So you see this Uranian and
unpredictable quality embodied

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
in these individuals
and they're empowered.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Pluto relates to
empowerment for good or ill,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and so it's so
interesting to see

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
how the first part of
the Uranus square Pluto

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
was defined by Barack
Obama's presidency

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and then how there was
this possibility of either

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
a woman, Hillary Clinton, which
carries another Uranus Pluto

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:84%
theme of the women's
movement and feminism.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of her
being elected in contrast

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to basically a symbol of the
complete opposite of what

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:84%
she, of what Barack
Obama represented.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And how you can see
the challenging--

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm being biased here.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But you can see these
very different energies

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that are also carried by
the Uranus Pluto alignment.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And revolutions, on the one
hand, they can be liberating,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
they can bring in
new energy, they

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
can bring in positive
change, but they can also

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:90%
be extraordinarily violent.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
They can be demoralizing,
and bring about change that

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
can feel for the worse as well.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to compare
our current Uranus Pluto

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
square to the last Uranus
Pluto square, which

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:90%
happened in the 1930s.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So this was in alignment
all through the decade

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
of the 1930s.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It came in with the
Great Depression.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
there was a t-square

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
of Saturn, Uranus, and Pluto.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So those Uranus Pluto energies
were unleashing the Saturn.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Saturn brings in the principle
of constraint, of constriction,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
of things falling, of
things going wrong,

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:90%
of the contraction and crisis.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And that t-square of
Saturn, Uranus, and Pluto

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
correlated with the
Great Depression.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the next time
that those three planets

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
were in that t-square
configuration of an opposition

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and two squares was from 2008
to 2011, correlating exactly

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:90%
with the Great Recession.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So we see this kind of
crisis and break down

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that then opens up to
a period of revolution

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and change and social upheaval.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the
1930s, that Uranus Pluto

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
square of the 1930s, here,
we see the rise of Hitler

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and the empowerment of
a demagogue in that era.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And then here in the next
square between Uranus and Pluto,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
we again see multiple
figures around the world

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
that are carrying this
same kind of empowering

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of the individual leaning
toward dictatorship that is

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:90%
reflective of that earlier era.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
This Uranus Pluto square is
coming to a close and by 2020,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and what has started
to come into orb

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
is a Saturn Pluto conjunction.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn Pluto is
very different energy

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:90%
than Uranus Pluto.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead of Uranus liberating,
awakening, opening up,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
accelerating the
Platonic, Saturn

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%
brings contraction,
constriction, crisis.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It brings the reality
principle, and this

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
started coming into orbit
in late 2017 already.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is our first
year of being in it.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The Saturn Pluto
conjunction will

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:90%
be tightest in 2019 and 2020.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And that, if we look back
again just at the 20th century

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
when Saturn and Pluto
came into alignment,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
we do see it correlated
with periods of major crisis

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and contraction and challenge,
difficulty at a social level.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So the First World War
began under a Saturn Pluto

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:90%
conjunction.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.845 align:middle line:84%
The Second World
War, which happened

00:18:13.845 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
at the end of starting in
1939, at the end of that year

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
honest Pluto square
just like we have now,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the Second World War began 1939
under a Saturn Pluto square.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The Vietnam War began under
a Saturn Pluto opposition

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:90%
in the mid 1960s.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
9/11 happened under a
Saturn Pluto opposition

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of this century.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very heavy,
challenging quality

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that's associated with the
Saturn Pluto combination.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
However, there are other
alignments of Saturn and Pluto

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
that haven't correlated
with a World War.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, the last
conjunction, the conjunction

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
before the one that
we're currently in,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that was at the
beginning of the 1980s.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
The 1980 to 1984 was tightest
in '81 and '82, and that Saturn

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Pluto conjunction, many
astrologers actually

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:84%
thought there might be a third
World War that started then,

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't happen.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is consciously
working with these energies

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:90%
in ways that can redirect them.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And you also see,
not necessarily

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
coming through in national
or international conflict,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
but other forms such as
maybe economic crisis

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
or empowerment of
conservative ideals,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that
can come with that.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But what can also be
forged in Saturn Pluto

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:84%
periods is a capacity
to face the shadow,

00:19:54.670 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to face the sides of humanity
that we don't want to own.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.435 align:middle line:84%
That we tend to
split off and other,

00:20:04.435 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they're
so often conflicts,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
a creation of an enemy or
another under Saturn Pluto

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:90%
periods.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Near the end of
his life, Carl Jung

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
was asked, what
would need to happen

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
for us to avoid some
kind of a nuclear war,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and his response was that the
extent to which each individual

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:84%
can own the shadow
within themselves,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:84%
can recognize, as he
says in his red book,

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that the line of good and evil
runs through your own heart.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The more each individual
can come to recognize that

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
within each of us
and the less we

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
split off that and
project it onto others,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:84%
that is the degree to which
we are less likely to enter

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of
conflict, some kind of war

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:90%
at an international scale.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So archetypal astrology can be
used as an interpretive tool,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
as a means to understand
the kinds of experiences

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that we have, whether
in everyday life or most

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
potently in
spiritual emergencies

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
or in non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic experiences,
work with holotropic

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
breathwork, work with
active imagination, even.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it is such a
profound tool and practice

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
for this is because, often,
those experiences, they're

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:90%
chaotic, they can be confusing.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
They're larger than life,
and having a grounding

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and an understanding of
the planetary archetypes

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
can, first of all,
give us language

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
to parse out what
we have experienced

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize
the archetypes lying

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
at the back of
those experiences.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So when in, perhaps a very
challenging psychedelic state,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
perhaps one is experiencing
oneself dying on a battlefield.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It feels like the end of
World War I and we experience

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in the
mud and the muck

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
with the wounds and the
groans of the dying,

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and maybe it's in the rain.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of very potent
experience like that.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then if one, for
example, knows the transits,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, this can be helpful
within the session itself,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but often, it's most
helpful afterward

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
when reviewing the session, then
you can come to the recognition

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, there's a Saturn
Neptune alignment in the sky

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
right now, and Saturn
Neptune correlates

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
with these feelings of
being drowning in the mud,

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:90%
being at the end of one's life.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Being separated from the
divine or some greater

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:90%
sense of cosmic meaning.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune, the
archetype of Neptune,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
it relates to the transcendent,
the spiritual, the numinous.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:90%
It symbolizes water.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It merges with whatever
it's in relationship to,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn, it's this principle
of death, of mortality,

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of endings, of loss, and when
you bring those two together,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the ways it
can come through

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of
existential experience

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of loss, of dying, of being
separated from the divine.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And just to go back to that
example of perhaps experiencing

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
in a psychedelic
session, being in the mud

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World
War I and dying

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:84%
alongside your fellow
soldiers, well, there

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
was a Saturn Neptune alignment
in the sky when World

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:90%
War I ended.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
example I'm giving

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
is actually a personal
example, and there

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:84%
was a Saturn Neptune
square in the sky

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:90%
at the time this happened.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:90%
So having that context--

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that interpretive context--
can help take oneself out

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of the individual personal
meaning of the session.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The personal elements can be so
important, can be so helpful,

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and it also can give
us a perspective

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of the transpersonal,
of the archetypal,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and see how these archetypes,
these gods, as James

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Hillman would say,
are living through us

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and are living into our
experience with the session.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic experiences,
or non-ordinary states

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
too, they tap us

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:84%
into that archetypal level
of reality in a much more

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:90%
direct and potent way.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's as though we
have crossed a threshold.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We've crossed a veil into
the realm of archetypes.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Into the realm of the gods.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And having the
tools of astrology

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to correlate the
positions of the planets

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
at the moment one is
having that experience,

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
also to understand our own birth
charts, our own natal charts

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to see, oh, that's why
I personally am having

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
this kind of experience
and someone else

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:84%
might be having a
totally different kind

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:90%
of experience on the same day.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You're sharing the
transits in common,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
but you have totally
different birth charts

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that you're bringing to it.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So it can help
bring that greater

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:90%
context and correlation.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I also find that the practice
of archetypal astrology and work

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:84%
with psychedelics and
non--ordinary states

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness are
mutually enhancing,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
mutually informing
of each other.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Because working with
astrology can help one

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
find an interpretation,
a context,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and a larger sense of meaning
to our personal psychedelic

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.790 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, going into
those non-ordinary states

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
can teach us about
those archetypes, which

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:84%
then expands our knowledge of
how archetypal astrology works

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and operates.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see parts of the
archetypes, how they manifest

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that you might not
have read about

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
in just studying astrology
through a textbook

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:90%
or from a teacher.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's this direct
experience of the archetypal.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
When we go into these kind of
transpersonal or collective

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
experiences and we recognize
the archetypal core behind it,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:84%
we can then look through
history at each time

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:84%
those two or more
planets correlated

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
with those archetypes
came into alignment,

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we can see this
diachronic patterning

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense of our
experience right now.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, yes, it
both does and doesn't

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:84%
matter that maybe it's our own
personal past life experience

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we're just having
an experience on behalf

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of the collective so
that isn't forgotten.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So that those moments that may
be so tragic or so joyful, so

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
ecstatic that reside in
the collective, maybe

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
reside in the
collective unconscious,

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
they live, again, through us
in these non ordinary states.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
practice of working

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
with the transits,
of understanding them

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
through an astrological
lens can provide a map

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to see each one of
those experiences

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
through history and then
how it comes to bear

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
on our own personal experience.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
important things

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
about archetypal astrology that
archetypal astrologers tend

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize-- and this is a
metaphor that's put forward

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:84%
both by Rick Tarnas
and by Stan Grof

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the positions
of the planets

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:90%
are like the hands of a clock.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when a clock
says that it's noon,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that it's 12 o'clock,
the clock itself

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:90%
isn't causing it to be noon.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:90%
It's correlated with it.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It is indicating the time.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the positions
of the planets

00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
are indicating the quality
of time of that moment.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important to keep
in mind the causality here.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
That it's not the
physical planets

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that are causing these
events to unfold.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It's rather the positions of
the planets and the human events

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
unfolding and the archetypal
thread that connects the two.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:90%
They are a synchronicity.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They are synchronicity
between inner human events

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
or collective human events and
the positions of the planets,

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the largest movement
in our solar system.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can be correlated
with the innermost private

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
experiences we have or our
relational experiences,

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
our community experiences,
or world events.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Politically, spiritually,
ecologically, even,

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and so you can see
these correlations

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
at so many levels playing
out upon the Earth,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
upon this remarkable
life-giving planet that

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:84%
seems to be, as Rick
Tarnas calls it,

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:90%
a moving center of meaning.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
That it's a moving center
of meaning in relation

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.710 align:middle line:84%
to the movements of all the
other planets and something

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
perhaps that's
even beyond those.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:90%
