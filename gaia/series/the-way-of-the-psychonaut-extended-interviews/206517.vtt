00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Transpersonal psychology,
I mean, the "trans,"

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the prefix "trans"
there suggests that

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
there's a recognized need to
go beyond something so "trans"

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:90%
is beyond.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's also equivalent
to another prefix "meta,"

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.271 align:middle line:90%
which implies transformation.

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So a transformation going
beyond, so the question

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:90%
is beyond what?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time that
transpersonal psychology,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
the movement, was founded
and to our own day,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:90%
the dominant mode--

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the dominant models
of psychology

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
conceive of the individual as a
more or less isolated atom that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:90%
can be studied from the outside.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a preoccupation
with behavior and adaptation

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to the dominant values
and social structures that

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:90%
define our world.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And behind that, there's a
tacit and sometimes explicit

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
assumption that what
we call mind or psyche

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but the
byproduct of the brain,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and that the brain
in turn is nothing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
but a complex neurochemical
and essentially

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:90%
a mechanistic system.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So dominant psychology
then is still more

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
or less reductionistic,
atomistic,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and unquestioning in terms
of fundamental values,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
particularly the values that
matter most increasingly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in our world that
is facing really,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
really serious planetary crises.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So transpersonal
psychology goes beyond

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:90%
these fundamental assumptions.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But in this way,
it's also going back

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to the very origins of
scientific psychology.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And most people, even
most psychologists,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
don't realize this,
that the founders

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of scientific psychology, Gustav
Theodor Fechner in the 18th--

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
in the 1800s, mid
1800s, for instance,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
the founder of
psychophysics in Europe,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
or William James, who taught
the first psychology course here

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
their psychology

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
was a transpersonal
psychology to begin with.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
They recognized that
the individual is not

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
an isolated atom
but is, in fact--

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
the boundaries of the individual
are permeable to a wider field,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
we might say, or a wider
participation in we

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
could call mind
at large or psyche

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
at large that
actually intersects

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
with realms, potential
experiences that are even trans

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
or beyond psyche that
we could call spirit.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So these were the
found-- and Jung,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of course, a little later,
a contemporary of James,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
was also a transpersonal
psychologist.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
He's known for his concept of
the collective unconscious.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But actually one of
the terms he uses

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
as a synonym for the
collective unconscious

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
is the transpersonal
unconscious.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So psychology in its
origins was transpersonal.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But then the wave of
the dominant culture,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
which was increasingly
preoccupied

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
with industrial growth society
and the mechanistic paradigm

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that was facilitating
that, colonized psychology

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and pushed the
transpersonal impulse

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that was there at
the beginning further

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and further to the margins.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until the '60s, of
course, the late 60s and 1970,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that transpersonal psychology
as a movement was founded,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
or we could say
refounded, and in that

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
way started recovering the
original transpersonal impulses

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
of psychology as a whole.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So the context in which
the transpersonal movement

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and transpersonal psychology was
founded around 1970, the term

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
was coined by Stan
Grof but in dialogue

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
with Abraham Maslow,
Anthony Sutich, and others.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The context, of course, was the
'60s countercultural movement,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
which had so radically affected
and transformed the wider

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
society in so many ways.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
elements, of course,

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
entering into that
revolution were

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
a youth culture that was open to
new ideas, that was unsatisfied

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
with the status quo,
particularly business as usual

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that was only interested in
war and empire and consumerism.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.698 align:middle line:84%
Now this coincided with a
changing of immigration policy

00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
so that there were
more people coming

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
from East Asia to
the United States

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and thus more access to
teachings from the East,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
along with a general
interest and curiosity

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
about contemplative practices,
both East and West mysticism

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And then a final
element, of course,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
was the introduction of LSD and
other mind-altering substances.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But LSD played a
particularly catalyzing role

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:90%
throughout the '60s.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things served
sort of synchronistically

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to prepare the collective psyche
in particularly the youth,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but not only the literally
young but those who are young at

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
heart and young in mind,
to be open to radically

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:90%
new perspectives.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, Stan had
his own route into this.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But here in the United
States, centered

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
around the Esalen community, the
Esalen Institute, and the Bay

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Area more generally,
the people interested

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
in these developments who
were trained in psychology

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
came together and saw the
need for making explicit

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
what was already
happening at the leading

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
edge of psychological research.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
There had already
been a transformation

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that was called humanistic
psychology in the '50s

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and '60s.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But behind the
humanistic movement

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
was a lingering
presupposition that--

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
not in all cases--
but that wanted to--

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that felt we should limit our
model of psyche and of mind

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to the secular realm,
to humanistic values,

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.260 align:middle line:90%
as noble as they are.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't quite enough.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't quite
enough room in most

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of the humanistic
models to account

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
for what was arising
spontaneously

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in these deep states of
non-ordinary consciousness,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
let alone the
multi-milennial tradition

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of contemplative
practices and mysticism.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So Stan, Anthony
Sutich, Abraham Maslow,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the founders
of humanistic psychology,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
he had already
suggested the need

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
for another level of development
beyond self-actualization,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
which he called
self-transcendence.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So they all came together and
decided to formally launch

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
this new movement of
transpersonal psychology

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that would make room for the
integration of the realms that

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:16.060 align:middle line:84%
were explicitly excluded from
behaviorism and psychoanalysis,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
as well as most
scientifically-oriented

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.210 align:middle line:90%
psychology.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Two of the great figures in
transpersonal psychology, Carl

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Jung and Stanislav Grof;
start with Jung, for instance,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Now Jung's idea of the
collective unconscious was

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
an attempt to use as
value-neutral language that

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
would be acceptable to
the scientific community

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
to describe the--

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
or to make room for a
wide range of phenomena

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that he experienced
in his own life

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and in the lives of his clients
and in his general studies

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:90%
of culture and so on.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So the body has a
universal structure.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:90%
There's an anatomy to the body.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Jung said similarly
there is anatomy-- there

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
is an anatomy of the psyche.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The psyche, too, has its organs,
which, just like the body,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
are universally present in the
relations with one another,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:90%
insofar as we are human beings.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So the collective unconscious,
from a scientific point

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of view, could be described
as an anatomy of the psyche.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the organs in this
case, the deep structures,

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the universal structures of the
psyche, he called archetypes.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
scientific inflection

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of speaking about the
collective unconscious.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But Jung also sometimes
speaks of these organs

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
or the archetypes as
gods and goddesses.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And Jung's disciple James
Hillman went even further

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and saw no difference between
the idea of archetypes

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and gods and goddesses.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, to speak of
gods and goddesses in the psyche

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is anathema to the dominant
scientific paradigm,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
so it all depends on
who one is speaking to.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But the other way of
looking at it is this.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The deep potentials
of the psyche,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.967 align:middle line:84%
we can call them
structures or energies.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
There's different ways
of speaking about it.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We can take a more conceptual,
typically scientific route

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
into describing the collective
unconscious of the archetypes,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
or we can take a more
metaphorical, symbolic,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:84%
expressive route
that actually we

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
need to take if we're going
to be true to the experience.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If we're doing a phenomenology
of human experience

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and we start seeing parallels
in the experiences of people,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:84%
not only individuals
at the same time

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
but between individuals across
time and across cultures,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
then in describing
these recurring

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
patterns and universal
qualities of experience,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not enough simply to call
them structures, for instance,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
or patterns because, in fact,
these structures or patterns

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
appear again and
again in ways that we

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
need to be true to by
describing them as forces,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
as gods or spirits, or in using
specific imagery like death

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So rebirth, for instance, is
a universal image experience

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
across culture, but
it's hard to pin it down

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
in traditional
scientific language.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
People or for all
indigenous cultures

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.120 align:middle line:84%
who have specific
names for these beings

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that they encounter and they
have personal relationships to,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
if we're studying them from
the outside as scientists,

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
let's say, we might want to
refer to them by another name.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But if we're being true to
what they are experiencing,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:90%
we have to use their names.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now here's another
example, though.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We can say that
we all have minds,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:90%
and that's evidently true.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
But to say that I am
a mind doesn't capture

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:90%
who I feel myself to be.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a person, let's say.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But is person a scientific
category or concept

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
in the way that a mind
is or that behavior is?

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there are
theories of personality.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of a
person that we feel

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
we are immediately
and intuitively

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and that we recognize
in other people,

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
in other persons
we meet, there's

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
a quality to personhood
that can't be reduced

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:90%
to standard scientific terms.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And the same is true for the
idea of a god or a spirit.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
These are words
that help us have

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or that honor our more
immediate embodied participatory

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
relationship to that
which we're studying.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Now if we want to describe
these things from the outside,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
as it were, so that we can
quantify them and measure them,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
then sure we can call
them by different names.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to be true to
psyche, to the experiences that

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
actually arise, then we
need to take seriously

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the names that have always been
given to them by the people who

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:90%
have these experiences.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And these names have been things
like spirits, gods, goddesses,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
or, more particularly,
particular spirits and gods

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses, like Kali or
Crow or the Great Mother.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
These images and words
capture something

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
about the experiences that are
essential to the experiences

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The collective unconscious
is such a fascinating concept

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
because it helps us enter
into from the scientific route

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
into an intuition that we
already have deep down,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that we are not just
isolated individuals.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not just atoms
bumping into each other.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But that we all
participate in something

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that includes us,
right, and this

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is what the
collective unconscious

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
seeks to honor as a scientific
psychological model.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Now the content of the
collective unconscious,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Jung describes in
terms of archetypes.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are, in principle,
an infinite number

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
of archetypes, the
deep structures,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:90%
or universal patterns.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Numbers, for instance,
are archetypal.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:90%
They're universal.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Just think of count, 1 to 10.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
We see the first 10
numbers universally.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But numbers don't end,
so similarly there's

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
an infinite variety
of archetypes,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:90%
but that can be bewildering.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So Jung also helps us see
that in the infinite plurality

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
of archetypes, the whole field
of the collective unconscious

00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually coherently organized
around a dynamic vital center

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:90%
that he called the self.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Now what is the self?

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
If you do a
phenomenological exploration

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:84%
of how the self appears
in people's dreams,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or
cross-culturally

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in mythologies and
religious dogmas,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
you see that the self is
indistinguishable, Jung said,

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.562 align:middle line:90%
from the God image.

00:16:26.562 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
What does he mean
by the God image?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't-- he means specific
images of how the divine have

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But he also means whatever has
the highest charge, the highest

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
value, the highest meaning, that
center of meaning and value.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:90%
That is the God image.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So the self is
organized around that

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:84%
which has the greatest, the
deepest meaning and value

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and energy.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And what is that, we might say?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jung and
Stan Grof, I think,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
agree in saying that at
the center is life itself.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the mystery of life,
which we're embedded in,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
which we reproduce moment by
moment every time we breathe,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
every pulse of every cell,
is both an expression of life

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and serves to produce
and reproduce life.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.340 align:middle line:90%
So this mystery of life is the--

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is at the core of what
Jung called the self--

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:84%
is the central archetype,
which we all share.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And what our task--

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
our task to understand and
preserve and celebrate life,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
this is the highest
value, according to Jung.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think implicitly and
even explicitly in Stan's work

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Now where this shows up
most interestingly for me

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
in Stan's work is
in the centrality

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomenon of birth.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Now birth obviously is
our entry into life.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
we enter into life

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's only through the actual
birth process to its completion

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that we as individuals
become relatively autonomous

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
relational participants in
this ongoing mystery of life

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:84%
at an organismic level
and at a psychic--

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:90%
psychological level.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, one of the great
contributions of Stan's work

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is that he uncovered
the deep structure,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal pattern, you
might say, of the life process

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as it is incarnated
and reincarnated

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
in us as individuals
and in all individuals.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And that deep archetypal
process of life

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that he describes in terms of
the basic perinatal matrices

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:90%
confirms--

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:90%
maps onto precisely Jung's--

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
what Jung had discovered
about the central archetype

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
of the self, which
Jung also linked

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
to the archetype of life.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So life, the self, the God
image, the highest value,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
birth, the birth process,
these are all part

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
of a complex mystery that Stan's
work has done so much to help

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:90%
us engage and understand.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so all traditional cultures
had and have to the extent

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that these indigenous
or traditional cultures

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
exist and, of course,
they're greatly threatened,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and they've suffered so
much over the last couple

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of centuries, but all
traditional societies

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
have had rites of passage.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And these rites of passage were
used to facilitate and catalyze

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
key transitions in the
development of the individual

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and the cultural, social group
in which the individual is

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:90%
embedded.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the most common
ones are rites of passage,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
particularly for young
males, at puberty

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that signals their transition
from boyhood to adult

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
male status, where
they can assume

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
their full responsibility
as members of the group.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So-- but there
are other moments.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
In traditional world religions,
for instance, there's

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
generally a rite of
passage that corresponds

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
to this threshold of adulthood
that in the Catholic Church,

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
for instance, is confirmation.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's the rite
of baptism as well,

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:84%
which can be initiated,
as it typically

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is these days for many
Christians, in infancy

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but which is also
practiced in adulthood.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the rite,
of course, of marriage,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and there are funeral
rites of passage.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:84%
There are rites of passage
around sickness or transition

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.390 align:middle line:84%
into special rules, like
being a chief of the clan

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:90%
or being a priest.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So wherever identity is going
to shift or be transformed

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of a new
and deeper and greater

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
responsibility, rites of
passage serve to catalyze that.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And now the basic structure of
a rite of passage is threefold.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a separation
from the familiar.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And if this is a
puberty rite of passage,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
it means separation from
the family, the root family

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and particularly the mother,
so from childhood attachments,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:90%
separation.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And then a phase, a so-called
liminal phase of initiation,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and this phase almost
always involves

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
either literal or a symbolic
but deeply experiential

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The physical body and
the emotional life

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
are put in a situation
of great extremity

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that encourages letting
go of prior attachments

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and a testing of the inherent
resilience of the body

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and the heart and the mind
in the face of adversity

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and of life and
death challenges.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's at this threshold
of encounter with death

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that, if successful, some
kind of transmission occurs.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And in traditional
societies, this

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is usually a transmission
from the elders,

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
who are the keepers
of the wisdom

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of their particular culture.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So there might be sacred
objects that are revealed

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
or stories that are told or
mantras that are communicated.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, if the
individual is successful,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:84%
they will now be members of
a new circle of communion

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that is consciously
continuous with the ancestors

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and with the higher or deeper
beings, the gods and goddesses,

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the spirits, the protectors
of the land and so on,

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
so that they can emerge
in the third phase

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and return to their communities
as keepers of these deeper

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:90%
truths.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So these are the traditional
rites of passage,

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, we've almost
all lost in our own culture.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds almost like hazing
in college fraternities is some

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.123 align:middle line:84%
feeble or dangerous attempt to
recreate something like that.

00:24:30.123 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Hazing and, of course, we see
it in inner-city gangs, where

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
usually the males are forced
to put their lives at risk

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately often
by harming others,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
in order to prove their
resilience and worthiness

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:90%
to become members of the group.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is
a deeply ingrained

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
archetypal expectation
on the part

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.360 align:middle line:84%
of individuals, when they
reach a certain level

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of potential maturity.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't
have the, we might

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
say, spiritually inflected
and culturally inflected

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of life support,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
then these impulses will
take other forms, of course.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, a fascinating
thing about rites

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of passage in relation
to Stan's work

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the deep structure
of birth that he uncovered

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
replicates the deep structure
of rites of passage.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, what we
realize, particularly

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
through Stan's
work, is that birth

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
itself is not only
a rite of passage

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
but is perhaps the
universal rite of passage

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that we all go through to
bring us into the web of life,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and not only of biological life
but of specifically human life.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as we know, human beings
can't survive the birth process

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
unless they are immediately
taken up in circles of care

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
by whoever the
primary caregiver is--

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.265 align:middle line:84%
historically, usually,
it's the mother;

00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't need to be
the biological mother--

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and the wider community in which
these caregivers are given.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So all of us have undergone
this initial rite of passage.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it's
through that experience

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that we come into the
world knowing deeply

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that if we are to succeed
in the ongoing actualization

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of our potentials,
whatever they are

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, throughout the
life cycle for however long we

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
live, we will need
to undergo repeatedly

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:84%
similar rites of passage,
similar births, which

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:90%
are always deaths.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So birth is always a death,
and death is, gods willing,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:90%
followed by a birth.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:84%
In my own experience
and of those

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've spoken to about
their own similar experiences,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:32.575 align:middle line:84%
it seems that in
moments of extremity

00:27:32.575 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that the natural response is to
contract-- to contract in fear.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And the body contracts.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the breathing
gets shallower.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:90%
The diaphragm tightens.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:90%
The shoulders tighten and so on.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural response.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But so this contraction and
fear reinforces the sense

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that we are a separate--

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
only a separate
self, a separate self

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that has no essential
connection to anything else.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
In these initiatory
experiences, which

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
can include illness and
accidents and all kinds

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of physical injury and
emotional trauma and so on,

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
we will quite naturally
contract as an initial response

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to preserve our integrity.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain
point, the contraction

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.778 align:middle line:90%
becomes counterproductive.

00:28:34.778 --> 00:28:36.570 align:middle line:84%
If we take it to the
extreme, for instance,

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:90%
we stop breathing.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the body has its innate
response at a certain point.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Usually that if we--

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.110 align:middle line:84%
we can't stop breathing
forever because we'll die.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So, ultimately, we have
to let go and breathe in.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
If we're lucky in these
intense experiential encounters

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
with the deep psyche,
at a certain moment,

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:90%
the contraction will let go.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's a moment of grace.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:84%
When we let go,
what seems to happen

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is that we find that contrary
to our greatest fear,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:84%
we are always already held
within a wider web of life in--

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:84%
we're held in a wider
embrace of interbeing,

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:90%
which is life itself.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it spirit also.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And-- but, unfortunately,
for some of us,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:84%
we can't have that
experience until we've

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.485 align:middle line:84%
hung on for dear life
for as long as we can.

00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.960 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And so Jung talks about how
when we ignore the deeper

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
promptings of the psyche, of
the collective unconscious,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:84%
they tend to come upon us
from the outside as fate.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And now if we look at
our shared planetary

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
situation at the
moment, we are really

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:90%
balancing on the precipice.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We're collectively involved in
an unanticipated, unrehearsed

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:84%
rite of passage, hurtling
towards a near-death experience

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
with the mass
extinction of species

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:84%
underway, with the threats
to biological diversity,

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
with the ever-present
threat of thermonuclear war

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
along with other
conventional forms of war,

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.520 align:middle line:84%
civilizational
collapse, and so on.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.950 align:middle line:84%
These are all
mounting, interfering--

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
mutually interfering
reinforcing crises

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that were participating
in and that we've

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
been creating as a species and
the industrialized nations,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the cultures that
they have promoted,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in particular, have been causing
without really knowing it.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Now the dominant worldview
of industrial growth society

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that has brought the
planet to the precipice

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:84%
has systematically ignored the
deeper dimensions of psyche,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal
dimensions, spirit even,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:84%
at the core of which is
the ethical responsibility

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to engage consciously this
numinous mystery of life

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and the initiation
into life, the repeated

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
initiation into
life, that involves

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
an encounter with our
own mortality and death.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as if that by
ignoring that progressively

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:84%
