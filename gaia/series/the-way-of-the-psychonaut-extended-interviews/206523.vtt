00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
studies was the Good Friday

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Experiment, and it was
about whether psychedelics

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in religiously-inclined people
in a religious setting could

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
help them have a religious,
mystical experience.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And 20 students from
Andover-Newton Theological

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Seminary went into
Boston University Chapel,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and half got psilocybin
and half got a placebo.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The minister was
Reverend Howard Thurman,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
who was Martin Luther King's
mentor, because Martin Luther

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:84%
King got a PhD at
Boston University,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and he permitted
that to take place.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And the study showed
that people did have--

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:90%
who had the psilocybin--

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:90%
they had a mystical experience.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Nine out of the 20 people
had a mystical experience,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and 8 out of the 9
had the psilocybin.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:90%
So it was proven.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But then in a
tragedy, Walter Pahnke

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
died in a scuba diving
accident in 1971.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the mystical
literature, the real test

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
of a mystical experience
is called the fruits test.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, is it positive
in people's lives?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You can describe all
sorts of experiences,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
but really, the fruits
test is the key, final step

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate the validity
of a mystical experience.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I became interested in
doing a long-term followup

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to the Good Friday Experiment
because I thought, here,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:90%
this is now the fruits test.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I can ask people,
roughly 25 years later,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
what they think
about the experience.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I realized
that Walter Pahnke probably

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
would have done this
if he hadn't died,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but because he had died,
nobody was doing this.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't need permission
from anybody to do it.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I did go to Andover-Newton
Theological Seminary,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I'd like to
do this long-term followup

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
with your students,
could I put something

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
in the alumni newsletter?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And they refused
to let me do that.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.978 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we don't
want to talk about this.

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is one of
the most important studies

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
in the history of religion ever
done, you're a seminary school,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
it was with your students, how
could you not want to help me?

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was, of course, during
the Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
escalation of the drug war time,
and so they refused to help me.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So I ended up--

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
out of frustration, I went to
the library at Andover-Newton,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and I said, let me just see if
the Good Friday study is there.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't part of the library.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:90%
They didn't even have it there.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just started wandering
around a little bit,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and then I stumbled,
somehow or other,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
on several catalogs of
students from Andover-Newton

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that were their
alumni catalogs that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
had their names and
addresses and the years

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:90%
that they were there.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So I picked everybody
that could conceivably

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
have been in school in 1962
and wrote hundreds and hundreds

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:90%
of letters to all these people.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And I got three
postcards back saying

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:90%
that they'd been in the study.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, they eventually led
me to 19 out of the 20 people.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.533 align:middle line:84%
So I identified 19
out of 20 people.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were willing
to fly me all over the country

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to interview different people
to see what they had to say.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was
that those people that

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
had had the psilocybin
had very strong memory

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:90%
for parts of what happened.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And those people that had the
placebo, it was like, yeah,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I was in that experiment,
but they couldn't-- they

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
vividness of the details.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was, first off, that these
experiences with psychedelics

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
are profound and they have an
unusual impact on our memory

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and how we recall them.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
They're somehow very vivid.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, I also found
out what I thought, later,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
was the key to the 1960s, which
was that these people that

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
had the mystical
experience described

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
how it impacted their lives.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the
sense of connection,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:90%
the sense of unity--

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
that it did make them
more compassionate

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
about other people, more
tolerant of other people's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
religions, less
fundamentalist, more spiritual.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
That it helped them to look
at the struggles of the day.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It reduced their fear of death.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they saw the
protests about the Vietnam War

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
or environmental movements
or all these things,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
they participated more
in these protests.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And that made me realize
that it was psychedelics gone

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
right that really
caused the backlash,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and it reaffirmed the
value of psychedelics.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first research
I ever did in my whole life,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and that was really something
that profoundly impacted me,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
because these people that I
talked to validated that it

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:90%
was a mystical experience.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had had
non-drug mystical experiences

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
before that, and that they
had described to me, though,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that they preferred the non-drug
mystical experiences that they

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
had had either before
or after the psilocybin

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
because they were more
uniformly positive.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And they described how they
had a lot more difficulties

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
during the experiment than
was revealed by Walter

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Pahnke in the dissertation.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And then what I discovered
was really disappointing

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
was that there was
one person that

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
had gotten so inspired by
Reverend Howard Thurman's

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
discussion, about how
you need to tell people

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
there's a man on the cross
and it's your obligation

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to spread the word and
to act in that way,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that he decided to
leave the chapel

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and run down Commonwealth
Avenue, which is

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:90%
right in front of Marsh Chapel.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And Huston Smith and Timothy
Leary went after him, just

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
to save him from being killed
by a car crash and stuff,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and they managed to capture him.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But then he didn't want
to go inside again,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and so they gave him
a shot of Thorazine

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and brought him back in.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And that appeared nowhere,
anywhere, in the study

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
or in the write-up or
in the news reports,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and also that people's difficult
experiences were underplayed

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:90%
in the dissertation I thought.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important to recognize

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that these drugs cause
people to sometimes feel

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
they're going crazy
or feel they're dying

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
or that they need support
during these experiences.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a rocket
ship going to the moon

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're blasting off, and it
helps if you have a seat belt,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, in all of this
energy as you're transitioning.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Or in a regular airplane,
that we need grounding,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:90%
we need support.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that
another key to the '60s

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
was that part of the
reason psychedelics

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
went wrong in so many people
is that they were given

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
an overly-positive view
of you take these drugs,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:84%
you get enlightened, and
that's all that it takes.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And just take more drugs.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what I believed
until I saw it didn't work.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's
been a lot of people

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
who were unprepared for the
challenges of psychedelics,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
were evangelized into
doing these drugs,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and that did lead to a lot of
problems that a lot of people

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's essential when
we discuss psychedelics now

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
challenging experiences,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and that it's not all easy.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We do psychedelic
harm reduction.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
MAPS does psychedelic harm
reduction at Burning Man

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and at festivals
all over the world.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of our main
principles is "difficult

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%
is not the same as bad."

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people really confuse that,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and they think these
are party drugs

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
have a good time,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and then if it gets
difficult, that's bad

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and I got to shut
it down, instead

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
of realizing that
when it's difficult,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that's sometimes the most
important material you

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:90%
need to pay attention to.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:90%
But you need support to do that.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I think this
underemphasis in the Good

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Friday Experiment
of the difficulties

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
left a lot of people unprepared
and didn't really enable

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
them to understand these
difficult experiences

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:90%
in a different context.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where,
with psychedelic therapy

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:84%
right now, we prepare people
in a much different way

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and really talk about how a
lot of the kernels of wisdom

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.200 align:middle line:84%
will come wrapped in these
very difficult experiences.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the difference
between recreational use

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and therapeutic use is,
in recreational use,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to have as good
a time as you can while you're

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
doing the drug, and then it
fades; and in therapeutic use,

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to have an
opening to whatever happens

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to bring
back lessons and integrate them

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in your life so that
your baseline is changed.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course, how
we approach therapeutic use

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
experience as much

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
it is about what you bring
back from the experience.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And the goal is to make it
so that you don't need drugs,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, that the drugs are
to help you to not need drugs.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
With recreational
use, the drugs are

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
about taking more
drugs and more drugs.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we've got
this way in which we now--

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
even Timothy Leary
really helped develop

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:90%
the idea of set and setting.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we understand it's
what your mental set is,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
what you bring into
this experience,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
as far as preparing for
what's going to happen.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you only want the fun
parts and something difficult

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
comes, you're going
to try to shut it down

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and you could end
up being worse off

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:90%
for months or years afterwards.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And with this idea
of the setting, too,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that you want to feel safe--

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the first principle--
we have four principles

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic harm reduction.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.885 align:middle line:84%
The first is create
a safe space.

00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, the set and setting
concept is about that.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's having a safe space where
you don't have to pay attention

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to your physical survival
needs and you can go inward,

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes closed-off and
in mental imagery as things are

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:90%
coming up from the unconscious.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very crucial
that you feel safe enough

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to do that, and you
become very vulnerable

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and you become, pretty
much, incapable in some ways

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.205 align:middle line:84%
of defending
yourself if somebody

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:90%
were to come attacking you.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
But you are protected.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a safe
setting, and your mental set

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is about opening
to whatever comes.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether it feels painful,
or happy, or whatever,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just opened
up to all of that.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And then try to
process it, and that's

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
where the therapeutic
support comes in.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So this concept
of set and setting

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
has become crucial to our
understanding of how to do

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic psychotherapy.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Stan has
talked a lot about how--

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
with his matrices-- that,
inevitable in all of us,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
there are these traumatic
experiences of being born,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of how that feels
life-threatening.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you do psychedelic
psychotherapy long enough,

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
you will inevitably have
difficult experiences.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like your
psychedelic use has gone wrong,

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
it's you're getting to this
stuff that's deeply programmed

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
you in certain ways and you need
to make that more conscious.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there's just so much

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've learned
from the work of Stan

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
observing thousands
and thousands of people

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:84%
doing LSD and the different role
for what the therapist does.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, the second principle
of our psychedelic harm

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
reduction is called
sitting not guiding,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and that, again, comes
from the approach

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that Stan has developed.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Guiding means that,
somehow or other,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
where the person needs to go.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're the therapist,
if you're the guide,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:84%
you know the territory, you
know where they need to go.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that at all.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like they know
their own territory.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
They have their own rhythms,
their own inner intelligence,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
their inner healing
intelligence.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what we follow,
rather than lead.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:90%
So we're sitting with people.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:90%
We're accompanying them.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.057 align:middle line:90%
We're supporting them.

00:12:16.057 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
But we're not guiding them.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Their own unconscious
is the guide.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.912 align:middle line:84%
And the other-- the
third principle--

00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the fourth being "difficult
is not the same as bad"--

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the third principle also
comes from Stan and his work,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's talked through,
not talked down.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So it used to be thought in
psychedelic harm reduction

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that you bring people
to a safe place

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and you just try to remind
them of how happy life can be

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and here's a flower or whatever,
you try to talk them down away

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
from what's bothering them.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And Stan's whole approach
has been talk them

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
into what's bothering them but
you get them to wrestle with it

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and talk about it and realize
help them handle it so you

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
talk through not talk down.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
That the way of
the path of healing

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:84%
is through the difficult
experiences not away from them

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:90%
or around them.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what we do
with the psychedelic harm

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
reduction and psychotherapy
has come from the lessons

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've learned
from Stan Grof.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the reason
for these classifications

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:90%
are political, not scientific.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They're not based on trying
to solve drug abuse problems.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's a quote
by John Ehrlichman, who

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:84%
was President Nixon's
domestic policy advisor,

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:90%
in an interview that he did.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I think it was late in the '70s.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And he talked
about the drug war,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about
how, for Nixon,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the principal enemies of
Nixon were the Civil Rights

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:90%
movement and the hippies--

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:90%
mostly hippies against Vietnam.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And what Ehrlichman said is that
we knew we couldn't criminalize

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
their beliefs or their
political actions,

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
but we could criminalize
the drugs that they used,

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and so we identified
Blacks and Civil Rights

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
activists with heroin and
hippies with psychedelics,

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and we exaggerated the
dangers of these drugs

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
for political purposes so we
could arrest their leaders,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
we could disrupt their meetings,
we could put them in jail.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, the real
origins of the drug war

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
were persecution of people
with minority opinions

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:90%
rather than about drug abuse.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were drug abuse
problems, but the proper--

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I would say-- the most
effective solution

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is honest drug education
and harm reduction

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and support for people who
are problem users through drug

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
treatment rather than
using prohibition

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
in the criminal
justice system, which

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
has perverse
consequences from that.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we've learned a lot
about how these drugs have

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
been classified.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But really, it
doesn't have to do

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:90%
with their potential for abuse.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with their
political considerations of how

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:90%
they've been seen in society.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, what we're trying
to do with psychedelics,

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and have been trying to do--

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, I started
MAPS 32 years ago--

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
has been to reschedule
these drugs as medicines.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we've learned
from medical marijuana

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and looking at attitudes
of American voters

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
towards marijuana
legalization for all purposes,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and also marijuana
for medical purposes,

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is that medicalization
leads to legalization.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
That people have been
fed such propaganda,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.295 align:middle line:84%
such scary propaganda
that they're

00:15:40.295 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
frightened of these drugs
and they're against them.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you show that
they can be medicalized

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.698 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
certain contexts

00:15:45.698 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
where the risks are
outweighed by the benefits,

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and then people can start seeing
more and more people that they

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
know or they've
heard about talking

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
about benefits,
and in particular,

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with medical marijuana, where
they can see dispensaries,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
where distribution
of the drugs is done

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
without gangsters,
without machine guns,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.265 align:middle line:84%
just in regular stores,
like liquor stores.

00:16:08.265 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
see many gun battles

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
outside of liquor stores
these days, but in the '20s,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:84%
there was gun battles
about alcohol all the time

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:90%
during Prohibition.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
medicalization of psychedelics

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
will eventually lead towards
legalization, which is crucial

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
because we all have a
fundamental human right

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to explore our consciousness,
and that that's

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
beneath the freedom
of the press,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
or the freedom of assembly,
or the freedom of speech.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Underneath all of those
freedoms guaranteed

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
to us in the Bill of Rights
is the freedom of thought,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and psychedelics are about
the freedom of thought.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The freedom to experience
our own different levels

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's really what
we need to be getting to,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that
these rights are actually

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:90%
not guaranteed.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
They are guaranteed
in the Bill of Rights,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
but people implement
them in different ways.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a massive rise
of authoritarianism in the US

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
and all over the
world, and so I think

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the need for psychedelics
and psychedelic

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and
psychedelic psychotherapy

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:90%
is greater than ever before.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that if
Stan Grof had not

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:84%
stayed true to the
value of psychedelics,

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that the psychedelic renaissance
might not be happening.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
When the repression comes
down, sometimes there's

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:84%
only a very few people that
are continuing the thread,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:90%
keeping the flame alive.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And we think about
that in the Dark Ages,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
in terms of monks at monasteries
that kept knowledge alive.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle Ages,
in the Dark Ages,

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
there was just a
massive societal

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:84%
forgetting about
things, but small groups

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:90%
could keep the flame alive.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, what I found was, there
was so much enormous interest

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in psychedelics,
in psychiatry from

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the '40s to the '50s to
the '60s, and then when

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.172 align:middle line:90%
the backlash came in 1970--

00:18:11.172 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it started
happening before that.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The research started
being shut down in '66.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Sandoz stopped providing
LSD to researchers.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
1966 was the last
time the National

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Mental Health
supported psychedelic research.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Then this backlash
keeps on going,

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
people that had done

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
work with psychedelics,
when that was taken out

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
of their hands, they
went into meditation

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
or to yoga or to any
number of different kind

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of non-drug psychotherapies.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of them--

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
even Ram Dass had this
statement about how when you--

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics are
like a phone call--

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:84%
the phone rings, and then
when you get the message,

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you hang up the phone
and you move on.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So most people that were
involved with psychedelics

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:84%
moved on and talked about
non-drug alternatives,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and that was the dominant theme.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people got into zen
meditation, and zen at the time

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:90%
was fairly anti-drug.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
But Stan didn't do that.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Stan developed
holotropic breathwork,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and he developed a
non-drug way to produce

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
a state similar to LSD and
to classic psychedelics.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
But in his public talks,
he would always acknowledge

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:90%
the value of psychedelics.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was really this thread,
virtually the only thread,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that was still talking about
the importance of psychedelics.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I met Jean Houston
and Robert Masters.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They had a book, "Varieties
of Psychedelic Experience."

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was, now,
in the '70s, and Jean

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
was doing a talk
in Tampa, Florida,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
not that far from Sarasota,
Florida, where I was.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought a
copy of "Varieties

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of Psychedelic
Experience" to her,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
because there's this chapter
on the training of the guides

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to be
trained as a guide.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I brought
the book to her,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't thinking
that she might think

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it
autographed, you know,

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to ask
her about parts of it.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But she took the book,
and she autographed it

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to "Rick, who can be psychedelic
without psychedelics."

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, that is
not what I'm asking about.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But I felt that Stan, through
the holotropic breathwork,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and through the way in
which he would continue

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the
value of psychedelics,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and through his publications--

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
"Realms of the Human
Unconscious" and on--

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, he was able to
acknowledge and legitimize

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
through his brilliance, through
his theoretical formulations

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
about how to understand the
unconscious from what he'd seen

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
from psychedelic experiences.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Through all of that,
he was the one that

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:90%
really kept the flame alive.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the way
in which he started

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
training other people in
holotropic breathwork--

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
most of the early
people that came--

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
so I was in the first
group that was formally

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
certified as holotropic
breathwork practitioners,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:90%
and this was from '88 to '91.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And we met every two--

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
we met for two weeks every six
months for six different times.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And most of the people
that were attracted to it

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
were really interested
in psychedelics,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and the holotropic
breathwork was

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:90%
a tool similar to psychedelics.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So I felt that Stan's role
was absolutely essential

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in providing a rallying
point, in a way,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
for people to come to who
still valued psychedelics,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and even the fact
that he developed

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
a technique through
breathing that was

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:90%
very much like psychedelics.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, without
Stan, I really don't

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.945 align:middle line:90%
know where we'd be at today.

00:22:03.945 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, responsible-- I
would say that humanity

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
is doing a very poor job
right now, in general,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
of facing the
challenges before us,

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.530 align:middle line:90%
because they're so frightening.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
scared, a lot of times

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
their rational mind
shuts down and they

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
try to repress information,
very similar to drug addiction,

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
where people are in denial about
the harm that they're doing.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't pay attention to it.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we have massive
climate change denial.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We have denial of
globalization, with a retreat

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to authoritarianism,
fundamentalism, nationalism.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
People are doing a
terrible job collectively

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:90%
in addressing the challenges.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we see global warming
moving more and more, almost

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:90%
irreversible in certain ways.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe technology
will help us later,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like there's just
a massive amount of repression

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:90%
and denial.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelics, by
their very nature,

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
bring things that are
repressed to the surface,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and in a safe set and setting,
can help people process--

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and in particular, MDMA--

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
help people process
scary, difficult emotions.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
psychedelics-- and by that, I

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
would include MDMA,
even though it's not

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
a classic psychedelic--
that they can really

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
help individuals
cope with the fears

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing because
of the downward trajectory

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that, then, once you
can cope with your fear,

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:90%
we can look at solutions.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.265 align:middle line:84%
And I think technologically
there will be solutions.

00:23:42.265 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
The human mind is absolutely
brilliant in the things that

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to create, but
they've-- sort of like opening

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
up Pandora's box-- they've
gotten out of control.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think we
can use technology

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to help us if we have the
emotional and spiritual depth

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to do so.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And psilocybin, MDMA, LSD,
all these psychedelics

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
can help us do that.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The other big thing, I
just want to mention,

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is that MDMA has been
talked a lot about in terms

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of couples therapy,
helping people

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:90%
navigate challenging emotions.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we're looking at

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
is MDMA and ayahuasca
for conflict resolution,

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
for multigenerational
trauma, the traumas that

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
are passed down generation
to generation, sometimes

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
hundreds, thousands of years.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Sunni-Shiite conflicts,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that's been going on well
over almost 1,500 years.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just astonishing the
way these hatreds go down

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:84%
generation to generation
to generation,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and I think psychedelic
psychotherapy can interrupt

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that within one
generation, sometimes

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
within one psychedelic session.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We can bring up these deep, deep
repressed fears of the other

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and process them.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's two
ways that psychedelics

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
can help with the current
crises that people are facing.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
One way is by helping people
reach deep down in their psyche

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to experience these mystical
senses of connection,

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to know that we're
all connected.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, the other is
through healing the trauma

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:90%
that people have grown up in.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And even if we don't
have it directly,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
just the trauma of
knowing that animals

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
are dying, that species are
dying, that the Earth is

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
being polluted.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody's
paying attention,

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.300 align:middle line:90%
they're traumatized in some way.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelics can help
us deal with those fears

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.667 align:middle line:84%
and still look
positively at what

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
we can do to contribute
to make them better.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like devoting
my life to bringing back

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic research was one
of the keys towards helping

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
humanity really
cope with change,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and also helping myself.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Stan has
talked a lot about it,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
as has Albert
Hofmann, who invented

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
LSD and first
synthesized psilocybin,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
about the role that psychedelics
can play in the current crises.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's also been another
solution, I would say,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
which is what we've learned
from the astronauts.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the astronauts who've
been up in space and have

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:84%
looked back at the
Earth from space

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and realized that it's
a single organism.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
That there are no clear
country boundaries.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:90%
That we're all in this together.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of this,
whatever, 14 billion years

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
That we're all in this together.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And many of the astronauts
have been spiritualized.

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell, you know, and
the founders of the Institute

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:90%
for Noetic Sciences.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Different ways in which--

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
when people grasp the
sense of the whole,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.192 align:middle line:84%
that has profound
political implications.

00:26:42.192 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot cheaper to
give somebody a psychedelic

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.692 align:middle line:90%
than shoot them up to the moon.

00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the framework
for the legalization

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics is
something that we're already

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
now currently
negotiating with the FDA,

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.670 align:middle line:84%
with the Drug Enforcement
Administration,

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
with the European
Medicines Agency.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think the key thing
to say about the medical use

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics is that
it's psychedelic-assisted

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
psychotherapy.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not the drug
that's the treatment.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
What's been considered to be
the most important advance

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in psychiatric research
in the last 20,

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:84%
30 years has been the
discovery of ketamine

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
for the treatment of
refractory depression.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a new mechanism, and
it works more quickly.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think a big
mistake is being made--

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is that most people now who
are setting up ketamine clinics

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
think about ketamine as a
pharmacological treatment

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and they deliver it
without psychotherapy,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
without any kind of support.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I've
heard of some people

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
who have gone for
ketamine therapy

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and tell us that their
doctors are telling them,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
don't pay attention
to these visions

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're having, this is just
about electroconvulsive therapy

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:90%
or resetting your brain.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
pharmacological treatment,

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that's actually
coming up in your consciousness

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.032 align:middle line:84%
is just a byproduct
of delusions.

00:28:02.032 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't pay attention
to it, it's all

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
about the pharmacological
treatment.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very disappointed the
way ketamine is being rolled out

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
in the world, particularly in
America, without psychotherapy.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But how it should be managed
is really ketamine-assisted

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy, MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy, LSD-assisted

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:90%
psychotherapy.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what's going to happen
once MDMA passes Phase 3

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and we've demonstrated
that it's helpful for PTSD,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
or psilocybin passes
Phase 3 and it's

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
helpful for treatment-resistant
depression or major depressive

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
disorder, is that
these drugs will

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
be approved in a different way
than other drugs are approved.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the FDA has what's
called the REMS--

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's a regulatory
mechanism for the FDA

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
to develop specific policies
for the unique risks

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of any new drug.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it used to be that
drugs would be approved

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and any physician could
prescribe it for anything,

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and that started changing with
the approval of thalidomide,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
which was the drug
in the '50s and '60s

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that was given to women
for morning sickness

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and caused terrible
birth defects.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.873 align:middle line:84%
But it's later been
found that thalidomide

00:29:15.873 --> 00:29:18.040 align:middle line:84%
is very helpful in treating
certain kinds of cancers

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and leprosy,
because constricting

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:84%
blood vessels in some
cases can be a good thing.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And so thalidomide is
approved, but the physicians

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
have to have special
education, the pharmacists

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:90%
have special education.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a brochure that
goes to the patients,

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's a patient
registry so every patient who

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
ever gets administered
thalidomide is tracked.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so far, there's been
no thalidomide babies

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:90%
because of these extra systems.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So for psychedelics, because
it's psychedelic-assisted

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.072 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy, the only people
that will be able to prescribe

00:29:55.072 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
this drug and the only people
that will be able to be

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in contact with the patients are
people that have been through

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the training program that
the sponsors-- in this case,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
MAPS or other groups--
for psilocybin--

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:84%
the training program
in our psychotherapies.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're only
going to be drugs

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:84%
administered under direct
supervision of the therapists.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.655 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be take-home drugs.

00:30:15.655 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's really going to
be about the creation

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic clinics.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, these
clinics will be--

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
people will be cross-trained
to deliver MDMA,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to deliver psilocybin,
to deliver ketamine,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:90%
all in a therapeutic context.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we're anticipating
that'll happen in 2021.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That we'll have MDMA
approved as a medicine,

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin approved
as a medicine.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start setting up
all these psychedelic clinics.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, there'll
be thousands and thousands

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:84%
of these clinics all over
America, all over Europe

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the world.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.923 align:middle line:84%
And what will start happening--
and what we've already,

00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
actually, started
doing research--

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is that you can bring in family
members to the treatment.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
So we've just done--

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:84%
it's super tiny,
but we've just done

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
a study called
cognitive-behavioral conjoint

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
therapy for PTSD
combined with MDMA.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So conjoint therapy
means couples,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's where one member of
the couple or dyad has PTSD

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and it affects
their relationship.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And we've been able
to get FDA, and DEA,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and IRB approval to give both
members of the couple MDMA,

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
not just the PTSD patient
but the other person as well.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And we see great
reductions in PTSD,

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:90%
and also improved relationships.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So the clinics will start
with the designated patients,

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:84%
but you can think about
somebody who has cancer

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:90%
or a life-threatening illness.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It affects them, but it affects
everybody around them too.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So the clinics start to
be with the patients,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
expand to be with the
families, and then--

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around 2030 or
so, what I think will start

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to happen is that we'll
have people who want to do

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics on their
own-- will go to clinics--

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:84%
like a driver's
license test almost,

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and they will have an
experience under supervision

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:84%
in the clinics, and if that goes
well, then they get a license

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and they can go
buy it on their own

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:90%
and do it whenever they want to.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they do it on
the beach behind us

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and they just strip
off all their clothes

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and run naked screaming
at people and stuff

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and they get busted,
then they get

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.463 align:middle line:90%
punished for whatever they did.

00:32:21.463 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But then they lose their
license to buy psychedelics

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
until they've completed some
sort of period of learning,

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think we'll have
licensed legalization.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And that will happen, we
believe, in roughly 2035.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And then people will be
able to have free access.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But still, if they want to
do it in religious contexts--

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
we'll have more
religious freedom too.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The Native American
Church uses peyote,

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
but from a federal
perspective, you

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
have to have 25% Indian blood to
be part of the Native American

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the states, a lot of
them don't have those rules.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
only case where we

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:90%
have religion limited by race.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's to protect, supposed,
American people from having

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:90%
legal access to peyote.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have expansion
of religious freedom.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll have more
uses of ayahuasca.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Right now, certain ayahuasca
churches are approved

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in the US-- the UDV--
the Uniao do Vegetal--

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:90%
and also Santo Daime.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But most ayahuasca
that's used in America

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is used in more
shamanistic settings

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:84%
without formal connections
to these religions,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's all
technically illegal,

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:90%
but there's no big prosecution.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people are
white, most of them

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
are well-connected, and
they're not getting harmed.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think there'll be an
expansion of religious freedom

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and expansion of
medical use and we'll

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.060 align:middle line:90%
have licensed legalization.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
last big, big step

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you train
the young people?

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:90%
What do you teach young people?

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
And how does that work?

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, right now, what
we have for even alcohol--

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.670 align:middle line:84%
well, alcohol is a
really good example,

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
because 23 states in America--

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
all states have
criminalized use by minors.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Different ages, 18 or 21.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
But 23 states permit
parents to introduce alcohol

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:84%
to their children
if they want to.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we'll end
up seeing with psychedelics

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
is that there will be a parental
override against prohibitions

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:84%
to minors, and that gets us back
to the Native American Church

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:90%
and the ayahuasca churches.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The way they run
their societies,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.219 align:middle line:84%
parents can introduce their
kids at different times,

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:84%
according to which
kids feel ready or not.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
we'll end up having

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:84%
this licensed legalization
system for adults

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and parental opportunity,
if they want,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
to administer
psychedelics to their kids

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:90%
as they're growing up however.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically a
family values plan

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
and is saying that
the family should

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:84%
be in charge, not
the government,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and that will be
bipartisan support.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the, I
think, Republicans

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:84%
can go for this
idea that families--

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:84%
we want to empower families
to make their own decisions.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I think
psychedelics will be regulated.
