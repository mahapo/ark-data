00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So the term archetype is
something that was introduced

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:84%
into psychology by the Swiss
psychiatrist, Carl Gustav Jung,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
who was initially a
follower of Freud,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
but then became a renegade
and expanded Freud's concept

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of the human unconscious
from the idea that it was

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
an individual unconscious,
something that is related

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
to the postnatal history, that
it contains things that we have

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
rejected, that we
have forgotten,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:90%
that we have repressed.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
He extended it to the concept
of collective unconscious,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
that somehow each of us carries
the entire history of humanity,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and also the cultural
history, which

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
would be the mythologies,
the mythological figures

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and the domains from mythology.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we have access
to them, even if we

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%
don't know them intellectually.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he discovered
that within the collective

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
unconscious there are certain
governing or organizing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
The concept is related
really to the Platonic ideal,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is a normally
invisible and not

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
available to any
of the human senses

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:84%
realm, which is
the realm of what

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
he called Ideas or Forms, which
would be written with capital

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:90%
letters.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And these actually,
according to him,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
would form and inform
what is happening here,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in the same way
as Plato believed

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that what is happening
on this level

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is actually governed by these
primordial cosmic patterns.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
He thought this is the
concept of archetypes.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So that actually then
explains archetypal astrology,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
That if the planets
represent forces, then

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
they have an impact on our
behavior here on Earth?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this then becomes, of
course, critical for astrology,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
where we have to now expend
our entire understanding

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, where the
universe is not a material

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
system that created itself, but
has been created by a superior

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the order,
such that there is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
a domain of this primordial
patterns of the archetypes,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and that determines what
is happening on our level.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And the dynamics, the
interactions of the archetypes,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
would be systematically
correlated

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
with the movement of the planets
and the angular relationships

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So in this kind of understanding
the planets don't do anything,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:90%
they don't cause anything.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We are not talking about
gravitational fields

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
or radiation coming
from these planets,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
but they indicate
in a sense what

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
is happening in the
archetypal world,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of energies that
we can expect on this level.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's more like what the
function of the watch is.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us what time it
is, something that we cannot

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:90%
experience directly.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But there are all
kinds of other things

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that are systematically
correlated with this time,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and we can use all of them
to infer what time it is.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So then a planetary
configuration is an indicator

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:90%
of forces that are at work?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so let's say in
an astrological chart,

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the planets stand
for archetypes,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
like Venus for beauty and love
and warm relationships and art

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and aesthetics.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And so Mars would be
related to prowess

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and the sort of masculine
power, yang in the Eastern

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.690 align:middle line:84%
understanding, even all the
way to aggression, and so on.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Neptune would represent the
mystical domain or also water,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:90%
ocean, and so on.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So those are representatives
of principles

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that can have actually
three different forms.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Rick Tarnis in his book
talks about archetypes

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
as having, on the one hand,
the kind of Homeric aspect

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that they could be seen as
deities, Aphrodite, Pluto,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Mars, and so on, which
would be the sort

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of mythological or Homeric
understanding of archetypes.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The archetypes also can be seen
as philosophical principles,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the way Plato saw it,
the idea that forms.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Or they can have
psychological aspects,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:84%
which is the way Jung brought it
into psychological principles.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that in this
collective unconscious certain

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
governing principles, certain
organizing cosmic principles,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and he used that term
archetype for them.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
When Rick Tarnas wrote
about it in his book,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
"Cosmos and Psyche," he showed
that you can see archetypes

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
from three different
perspectives.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
The first one he
called Homeric, and you

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
can see the archetypes as
deities, Aphrodite, Mars,

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Pluto, and so on.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you can also see them from
a philosophical perspective.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
That Plato's idea
of what he called

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Ideas or Forms, as
capital letters,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and for Plato those
were principles

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
existing or operating
from a domain

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that's not perceptible
to the senses,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
yet they form and inform what
is happening on this level.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the third perspective
that Rick Tarnas mentions

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is the psychological
perspective,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the way it appears in
the psychology of Carl Gustav

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Jung, and they see them
as principles operating

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:90%
in the psyche primarily.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The term psyche is not easy
to explain in simple terms,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
because there are very different
concepts and understanding

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:90%
of the psyche.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's understood
as the human psyche,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and in materialistic
science that

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
would be the product
of the brain,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of the neurophysiological
processes in the brain,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and would involve anything from
our perceptions of the world,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:90%
our emotions, our thoughts.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, we have
the concepts coming, let's say,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
from Eastern philosophies,
that in Western psychiatry

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
emerge in the form
of the work of Jung,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
where the psyche
really is cosmic.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:90%
He talks about anima mundi.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And our individual psyche
would be actually teased out

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of this cosmic fabric.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
in that sense, it

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
would reach far
beyond something that

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.420 align:middle line:84%
could be found
inside of our brain

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:90%
or it would come from our brain.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the existence
of the universe itself,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and would be closely related
to, let's say, the Hindu concept

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is created
by absolute consciousness.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Brahman, and that
we carry somehow

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
a spark of this cosmic
energy, which is called Atman.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Hindus will tell
you we are not Namarupa,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:90%
we are not name and shape.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
We are not body ego.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Our true identity is with
this divine spark, Atman.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience
it we realize

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that energy that we carry is
identical with the energy that

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:90%
created the universe.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So then when someone has a
hallucinogenic, or I'm sorry,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
when someone has a
psychedelic experience,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
their personal individual psyche
then expands to open to this

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:90%
cosmic psyche?

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'd like to mention,
it's a very interesting

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
observation that came
actually from Aldous Huxley,

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
a famous British American
philosopher and writer who

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
experimented with
mescaline and also LSD.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said that initially
he thought that somehow

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that these substances activate
certain contents, anagrams

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, and that they
emerge into consciousness.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
looked into it deeper

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
he said now he sees the
human brain actually

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:90%
has a reducing valve.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
That there is the psyche is
much, much larger and the brain

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
actually limits
the access that we

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
have to this cosmic
reservoir, which is

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting perspective.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The boundaries between
the individual psyche

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and this larger cosmic
psyche would not be absolute.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They would be permeable and what
I call the holotropic states,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
which is a certain important
category of non-ordinary states

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So a non-ordinary state
of consciousness, in fact,

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
then is just sort of
experiencing the world from

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
a greater perspective than
what materialistic society has

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:90%
taught us to acknowledge?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Within the usual concept in
materialistic science is that

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the universe is out
there, it's material,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and that we somehow managed to
perceive it through the senses,

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
the mediation of the brain.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But from this
larger perspectives,

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:84%
there are other dimensions of
existence that are normally not

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
accessible to our senses unless
we are in this special expanded

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness
that could be brought not

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
only by psychedelic
plants and substances,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
but they could also be reached
by meditation practices,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
shamanic practices, and so on.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, these deep
domains emerge spontaneously.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, for traditional psychiatry
this would be a mental disease.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
You see, this idea that this
additional kind of experiences

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
in everyday life

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
are created by some
pathological process interacting

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:90%
with the brain.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And what modern
consciousness research

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
has shown that these are what we
would call ontologically real.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
These dimensions really exist,
but they are not normally

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:90%
available to our senses.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to be in a special
state of consciousness,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and that state is
not pathological.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:90%
In a sense, it's supernormal.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:84%
What the mystics experience
is not a distorted perception

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of the world, but
they get access

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
to these normally invisible
but real dimensions of reality.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So a mystic would
not have the feeling

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
now my perception of
the world is distorted.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They would have
the feeling now I

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
am getting an enormous
amount of information that

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:84%
actually helps me understand who
am I and what it is all about.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of additional
and clarifying interesting

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
information that is
coming, not a distortion.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the initial
excitement when LSD first

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
came from Sandoz
pharmaceutical company

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to universities and
research institutes

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
was that this can
produce what we would be

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
called experimental psychosis.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And this was fascinating,
because we are talking

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:90%
about microscopic amounts.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
millionth of gram,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
hundred millionths
of gram can change

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:84%
profoundly human consciousness
for six to eight hours.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the initial
excitement was, first of all,

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that we have a model
here of psychosis.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:84%
We can give it to, quote
unquote, "normal" people.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We can do all kinds of tests
before, during, and after,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and we get an idea of
what's happening in the body

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
biologically, biochemically,
when the psyche is

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:90%
so profoundly influenced.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea was that
if this is the case, then

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
under certain circumstances
the human body

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
can produce substance
of that kind,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and that mental diseases would
not be really mental diseases.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They would be
aberrations of chemistry.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The body would
produce substances

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that would change the
functioning of the brain.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we could identify this
chemical culprit we could also

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
find ways of counteracting
it, find some kind

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
of neutralizing agent.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And this would have
been like a test tube

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:84%
solution of schizophrenia
and other psychosis.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
This would be like Holy
Grail of psychiatry.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So initially, there
were all kinds

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of pathological
associations, where

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
we talked about hallucinogens,
about deliriogenic,

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
about psychosomatic substances,
about experimental psychosis,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And the initial
research that we did

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
was actually along these lines,
looking for some solution

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:90%
for schizophrenia primarily.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And then as we were
experimenting with it,

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I found out something
fascinating,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
which convinced me that
we were not really doing

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:90%
psychopharmacology.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Which was incredible
what we call

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:90%
inter-individual variation.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It was different people
with the same dosage

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
under the same
circumstances, everybody

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
would have a completely
different experience.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And then if the same person
would take it repeatedly,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:84%
then also each of the
sessions would be different.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the way
pharmacology works.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You have a pretty good
idea what response

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
you would get with
antibiotics or strychnine

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever substance
we are talking about.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we would
not have pharmacology

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:90%
or psychopharmacology.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that this we
are dealing with a catalyst,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And that the content is not
produced by the substances,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's released from the
deep unconscious realms

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that current psychiatry and
psychology does not know about.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when it comes, they
think it's pathological.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't see it
as something that's

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:90%
germane to the human psyche.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing it as
a telescope, or a microscope,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:84%
something that provides access
to areas which are not normally

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Like a telescope we can
see galaxies that we cannot

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:90%
normally study.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
With microscope, you discover
an enormous micro world

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that is here, but we
are not aware of it

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:90%
unless we have the proper tool.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then I took it
from the laboratory

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to the clinical practice
and started seeing it

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
as something that's going
to deepen and intensify

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:90%
psychotherapy.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And then didn't you find
too in this process that once

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
people had expressed this deep
material that many had no idea

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
was even in there, that they
were healed or in a sense they

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
were less impacted by whatever
motivated their suffering

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
That after releasing this
material they were somehow

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:90%
more balanced as human beings?

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a tremendous
acceleration,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:90%
this tremendous deepening.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was in
psychoanalysis for seven years.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And when in the fourth year I
started bringing in my dreams

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
images that were oral,
related to the oral period,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:84%
this was considered to
be relatively successful

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:90%
psychoanalysis.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, with psychedelics,
you can go with larger dosage

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
you can go to birth and
pre-birth in the first session.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people who
compared one session to years

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of analysis or they
got beyond where they

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:90%
got in years of psychoanalysis.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm just curious, Stan,
also in terms of what you

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
noticed something
in the sessions.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
First, I want to talk
about yesterday we touched

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.680 align:middle line:84%
on the courage, or how you
learned that even though people

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
thought they might be dying in
the course of their session,

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:90%
they really weren't.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That it was really
just their psyche,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the information that was
coming up from their psyche

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
that they were working through.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.722 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>> That they realized
that it was coming from--

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well rather, that as you
worked with these patients

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
during your
psychedelic sessions,

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
first you started with
lower doses, correct?

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And that was more
biographical information?

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.025 align:middle line:84%
And then as the dose increased
you witnessed that it moved--

00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we used
initially lower dosages.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the beginning,
the common dose

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
was 100, 150, and so
on, and maybe up to 200

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:90%
in the clinical work.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So what came initially
for most people

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
were sort of geometrical
aesthetic kind of experiences.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
That was what we
know now as sort

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic art
and so on, and then

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:90%
the biographical level.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But if the sessions
were continued

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:90%
we were getting deeper.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of my patients
called it the onion peeling

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche, like
going layer after layer.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Which was very
fascinating because you

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:84%
could see how different
levels in the psyche

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
are interconnected and
how it is connected

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to symptoms, at which point
the symptoms would be modified.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But then when we had a
certain number of sessions

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
or increased the dosage, then
suddenly levels of the psyche

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
were manifesting that are
not part of psychoanalysis.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
If these levels would somehow
open up during psychoanalysis,

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
a traditional
psychoanalyst would

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
think this is the
end of psychoanalysis

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and would send that patient
to psychiatrists, because they

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
would feel that they are opening
up the psychotic terrain.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Our model does not
have reliving of birth.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, if somebody had difficult
birth and it starts coming up,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be wild and people
would be screaming and shaking

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:90%
and choking, and so on.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So this would be
seen as pathology,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and your ordinary psychoanalysis
couldn't handle it,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
so they would now be sent
to a psychiatrist, which

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
has happened quite a few
times, including my analyst

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
had a patient like that.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you observe--

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I guess what I remember is that
you had a series of patients

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that had similar
experiences, and then

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
when your own experiences,
your own LSD sessions,

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
it became clear to you that
people were re-experiencing

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:90%
the birth process.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
how that passed?

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
How that came to be?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I started seeing
patterns when I was working

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
these serial sessions
with a lot for patients.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the patterns
were individual.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I found out that the
contents in the unconscious

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
were not stored in a form of
kind of disconnected mosaic,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
but they were forming certain
dynamic constellations, where

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
certain issues were
appearing on different levels

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:84%
at different times
of their biography.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were creating
these dynamic packets

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that were connected with
the same type of emotions

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%
or a physical feeling.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, they would have
a choking constellation,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
like there would be a situation
of near drowning when they were

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
seven, then being choked by
an older brother at the time

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly when they were
four, then whooping cough.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But then the deeper level
was the choking at birth.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So I started talking about these
constellations as COEX systems.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you describe
COEX, because that's really

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I find in my LSD sessions
that COEX experiences

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:90%
are incredibly profound.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like almost
going down a drain.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe what a COEX is?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a constellation
of experiences or events from

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
different periods of your
postnatal life that share

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:90%
in emotion or physical feelings.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So with choking
in COEX that could

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:84%
be COEX that has to do with
your bad experiences with men.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
That could be serious of
relationships and maybe teacher

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:90%
and then father.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:84%
There could be
experiences that have

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to do with being
contained, being confined.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
In some situations,
I had for example,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:84%
patients who were locked
in a closet for punishment.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Or there were quite
a few patients

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
who experienced in
infancy swaddling,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
was a situation where very, very
tightly bound to the infants.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So they experienced either
complete confinement

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
or complete freedom,
and nothing in between.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And that could be an overlay
over the situation at birth,

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
where something like
that is happening.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So there could be
that kind of a COEX.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Or even a person in
prison and then some kind

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
of containing situation
from childhood,

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and then being stuck in birth.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a theme,
there's a topic

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in the COEX that penetrates
all the different layers.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also a
specific connection then

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:90%
to emotional problems.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, note that
confinement would be associated

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:90%
to claustrophobia, let's say.

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The choking COEX
could be related

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:90%
to asthma, psychogenic asthma.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you also
observed, I believe,

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that beyond the perinatal
memories-- in fact,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:84%
could you describe the
four perinatal matrices?

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, when my patients
were regressing through

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
their biographical history and
they came to birth I noticed

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that the experiences were
forming four quite distinct

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
experiential patterns.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And then in time, I
realized on the basis

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
also of the reports
of the patients,

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that these patterns were related
to four consecutive stages

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of birth, characterized by
certain specific emotions,

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:90%
specific physical feelings.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But they also represented
a selective opening

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
into the next level, which
we now call transpersonal.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So the first matrix
of this kind was

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:90%
related to being in the womb.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Either a womb that was very
pleasant, very comfortable,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
or a womb that was
toxic, or where

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:90%
the mother was sick, and so on.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
The second one was a situation
when now birth starts,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the uterus is contracting,
but the cervix is not open.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So the experience
of this confinement,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
being in a kind of seemingly
hopeless situation.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And then another
matrix would be when

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
the cervix opens and the
contractions continue,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%
but now there is a way out.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
There is a struggle to
get out, to free oneself.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth pattern is
actually the actual coming out.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So I started talking about them
as basic perinatal matrices,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
or BPM.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So at the bottom
of the COEX systems

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:84%
there typically was
one of those matrices,

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:84%
depending on the nature of
the experiences in the COEX.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.175 align:middle line:84%
There were very
painful COEXes, there

00:28:22.175 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
are also very positive
COEXes, all kinds

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
of very fulfilling, beautiful
situations from your life.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
There's an overlay over
experience of the good womb,

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:38.310 align:middle line:84%
or good breastfeeding,
and so on.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out
later that the COEX also

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
had even deeper roots
linking them, let's say,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to what seemed to be
a past life experience

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
or what seemed to be a specific
archetype, or even animal

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
experiences or phylogenetic
experiences, ancestral

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:90%
experiences, and so on.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the planet in your
chart stand for archetypes,

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:84%
they're related to the
archetypes, and the angular

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:84%
relationships between them,
which will be like opposition

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
or what's called
square or conjunction,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
they would characterize
the COEX system.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And the layers of
the COEX system

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
would be created at the time
in some significant transit

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
activates that particular
core, which is already

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.445 align:middle line:90%
contained in your chart.

00:29:37.445 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So then if someone
through a non-ordinary state

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is able to
sort of go into that COEX system

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and have the deep experience of
passing through the perinatal

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
experience of that, and
even into the transpersonal,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.414 align:middle line:84%
that's considered a full
experience of that COEX?

00:30:04.414 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> See, when having had strict
materialistic education,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
medicine in a Marxist country,
I found it easiest to open up

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the thinking and
including birth,

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
material system there very,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:90%
very highly advanced.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually bizarre that
current psychiatry does not

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
recognize that
there is a trauma.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:84%
That biological birth
is a psychotrauma.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to these
transpersonal experiences,

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:84%
you cannot find any kind
of material substrate.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And so then I discovered with
a lot of intellectual struggle

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
the transpersonal domain,
the archetypes, the past life

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:84%
That was more
difficult to accept.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But then an even larger
kind of perspective

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
opened up when the whole
process was actually governed

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:90%
by archetypal dynamics.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the realm,
the archetypal realm,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that determines what kind of
experiences would be coming up.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, the person
would have a session

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.985 align:middle line:84%
in which there's a lot of
no exit kind of situation.

00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And they would have
the feeling this is

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
like the world of Franz Kafka.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They would suddenly feel this is
the way the existentialist saw

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:90%
existence.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They really had it down, they
really describe the way it is.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who sees it
differently is just rosy

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
glasses.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.900 align:middle line:84%
They would have some
kind of association

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to movies of Bergman and the
scenes from Nazi Germany.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out that that
person has some hard Saturn

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Pluto transit.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
these situations

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the common denominator
is again Saturn Pluto.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You find it as significant
in Jean-Paul Sartre's chart,

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
in Ingmar Bergman's
chart, in Kafka's chart.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And you find out this was the
world of transit at the time

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Nazi things were
happening with the Second World

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So the archetype is really a
clue to understanding what's

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:90%
happening in your session.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I remember one
time asking you from Joseph

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Campbell's "Hero's Journey,"
from that perspective,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:90%
what are your magical tools?

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned mythology
and archetypal astrology.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that accurate?

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I shouldn't say that,
but in this work I found much

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
more help in mythology and
archetypal psychology than

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:84%
in my psychiatric or
medical examination.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That played a role
only when I was

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
looking at the condition
of the patients in terms

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:84%
of indications,
contraindications

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
for psychedelics and
for the breathwork.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But once I knew that we were
working with healthy people,

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
there is not much
medicine in it.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And psychiatry
would be misleading.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
prevent you actually

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
from correctly understanding
what is happening.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So people who work with the
breathwork or with psychedelic,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
they have to unlearn
a lot of what they

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.523 align:middle line:90%
were taught at the university.

00:34:05.523 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Many, many people that I
worked with, professionals,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
got to recognize and appreciate
the value of shamanic

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:84%
practices, actually ended up
going to Peru or to Brazil

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that,
in some instances,

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
the shamans of
the Native culture

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
have a better understanding
of the psyche than you

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
get from Harvard
or from Stanford.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I remember when I
learned shamanic journey work

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:47.219 align:middle line:84%
with Michael Harner 20
something years ago,

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:84%
there were about 150
people in the room.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And probably 3/4 of them were
psychiatrists, psychologists,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and therapists.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So they were there to gain
a deeper understanding.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The work with these
non-ordinary states,

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:84%
particularly what I call
holotropic and subgroup, that

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
is healing transformative,
evolutionary,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:84%
that has also a
heuristic value, HUR.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The revolutionary
information that you

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
can get from these
experiences and observations,

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
they ask for urgent
revision radical overhaul

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of our thinking in
psychiatry and psychology.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This was going to be a
major paradigm shift,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to take a
while because it really

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.820 align:middle line:84%
changes most of the basic
assumptions in psychiatry.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And so bringing traditional
kind of training,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
psychological,
psychiatric training,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:90%
is going to be an obstacle.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make you less
effective or ineffective

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of work.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> There's this phrase
cartography of the psyche,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people credit
you with creating a whole new

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:90%
cartography of the psyche.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.403 align:middle line:84%
So if you could
describe, what was that?

00:36:07.403 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I think you already
have to some degree,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.990 align:middle line:84%
but the cartography
of the psyche when

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:84%
you began as a
psychiatrist was just

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
limited to one's personal
experience, is that correct?

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well the current model
cartography, if you want,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that's being used in psychiatry
and psychology is limited

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%
to post-natal biography.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the
psychological history

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
begins after we are born,
this follows Freud's dictum.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
The newborn is a
tabula rasa, it's

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
like a tabula
rasa, erased tablet

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.710 align:middle line:84%
where they were
writing in ancient Rome

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:90%
because they washed blackboard.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
that precedes birth

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that is of any relevance
for psychiatry,

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:90%
including birth itself.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no
recognition that birth

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.920 align:middle line:90%
is a trauma, major trauma.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So somehow the
brain of the newborn

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:84%
is not able to notice that
something strange is happening,

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.900 align:middle line:90%
and there is no record of that.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Which is absolutely
absurd, because there's

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
a general agreement
in child psychiatry

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and obstetrics that
what immediately follows

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:90%
is extremely important.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Nuances of nursing
can make a difference

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the
life of the individual.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:84%
There's even an
agreement that bonding,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.210 align:middle line:84%
which is exchange of the
looks between the mother

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and the child, can influence
the whole relationship

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:90%
between those two individuals.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And people who sort
of accept this,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
they think that the hours of a
life threatening, potentially

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:84%
life threatening
experience that preceded

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:90%
is not relevant psychologically.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I cannot follow that
logic in a group of people who

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
were trained in rigid sort of
logical, rational thinking.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's the present model.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So what had to be
added is that there

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:84%
is a powerful record
of the experiences,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:90%
of all the four stages of birth.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's supported by the
fact that there is now

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.270 align:middle line:84%
a prenatal research showing
sensitivity of the fetus

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
already in the womb, and
it goes way beyond you

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:41.050 align:middle line:84%
don't need a brain
to have memory.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The usual argument is the
newborn's brain cannot create

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.690 align:middle line:84%
memory of birth because it's
not what's called myelinized.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:84%
The covering of the neurons
by the myelin sheaths-- myelin

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.770 align:middle line:90%
is a fatty substance.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not completed.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That's given as a
reason why there

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be memory of birth.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, a Nobel Prize
was given 15 years ago or so

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to Eric Kandel for studying
memory mechanisms in a sea

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:90%
slug called Aplysia.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Sea slugs can have memories,
but this complex organ

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of the newborn,
brain of the newborn,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is not able to record anything
from hours of a potentially

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:90%
life threatening situation.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's one major very logical
expansion that has to happen.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Even in psychedelics, we just
need some straight thinking

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that's not influenced
by the trauma itself.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's so scary that you don't
want to go there, and think

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
You come up with some story
why that was not relevant.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But then it expands
and then you have

00:39:54.790 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to add the domain that was so
thoroughly explored by Jung

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and his followers, the
collective unconscious,

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
both the historical
and archetypal domain.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is cartography
we have to have to make

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:90%
our understanding better.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have adequate
understanding of emotional

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
psychosomatic problems unless
we use this cartography,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and we will not be very
effective by treating emotional

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:90%
psychosomatic problem.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because talking-- you
cannot talk at birth.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:90%
You cannot reach those levels.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You need experiential
method where

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:84%
people can deal
with the emotions,

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and they can release the
pent up blocked energy

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that comes from the situation.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We once talked
about a pyromaniac,

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%
the kind of experiences that
someone might have in the birth

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:84%
process that remain
sort of unconscious

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
or in the subconscious, and
that an individual might be

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
propelled to certain
behavior as a young person

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:20.610 align:middle line:84%
or into adulthood, as a sort of
unconscious desire to recreate

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.390 align:middle line:84%
that experience to sort
of make peace with it.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe that?

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
fascinating to me.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well what you
see, if you have this kind

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of understanding you can see
many of the conditions that are

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:84%
considered pathology as a kind
of a misguided or I would say,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:84%
as an attempt at healing,
which is based on inadequate

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
what is happening.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So for example, various
sadomasochistic practices,

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:84%
where people need to be
choked at the same time

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
they are experiencing
sexual arousal.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
They have to be bound, they
have to be confined, so on,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that is a situation
that you would

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.610 align:middle line:84%
have in people who are reliving
what I call the third matrix.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The struggle through
the birth canal,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.720 align:middle line:84%
where the choking and
the pain generates

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sexual feelings.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, if these people
would have that experience

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in a psychedelic session
or a holotropic session,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:84%
or even supported
spiritual emergency,

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:84%
they would clear somehow this
memory, the traumatic memory,

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and it would move them to
the fourth matrix, which

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.760 align:middle line:90%
is coming out.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, they somehow feel that they
need that kind of experience,

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:02.360 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know that for it
to be really healing and useful

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.020 align:middle line:84%
it would have to come
from their unconscious,

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.870 align:middle line:84%
with understanding
what you are dealing

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.610 align:middle line:90%
with where it is coming from.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Just sort of
fabricating this kind

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of a situation in everyday life
without this deeper connection

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:84%
will just create a need to
repeat it again and again,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:84%
because you feel that it
should bring something

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.470 align:middle line:90%
that is not bringing you.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And like the arsonist
is another example.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
For many people, the
coming out, the transition

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.040 align:middle line:84%
from the third to
the fourth matrix,

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
is associated with experience
of fire, passing through fire,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.620 align:middle line:90%
being burned in fire.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.570 align:middle line:84%
It could be connected
with the past life

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:84%
experience of being burned
at the stake or in a house.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
experienced at the time

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:90%
of the transition, the opening.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they can be in
a psychological state

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:84%
where they feel that somehow
experiencing enormous fire

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.740 align:middle line:84%
would be fantastic for them,
bring something fantastic.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually do,
and they start the fire.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
watching it they

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:90%
experience some excitement.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the fire is
over, but it didn't

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:90%
deliver what they expected.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So they would try again
because the feeling

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.800 align:middle line:84%
that they need something
like that is very strong.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, the extreme
form, of course,

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:44.430 align:middle line:84%
is when people are
somehow at the transition.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:84%
What's emerging is now the
situation when they were born,

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really emerging
fully, which would be healing.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's sort of strong
enough to the threshold

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that they
feel that they should die.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:03.890 align:middle line:84%
There's an experience of
ego death and rebirth.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
But in our culture, you cannot
die in any other way than

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:84%
killing the body, because you're
thought that you are your body.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, what this is
about is the experience,

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.120 align:middle line:90%
death followed by rebirth.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So the work with these
people would be somehow

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
sending them a message that
it's not the result of pathology

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that they're sick,
they're depressed,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.145 align:middle line:84%
and this is why
they want to die.

00:45:37.145 --> 00:45:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And that if we
treat them they're

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not going to not have
this death wish anymore.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.560 align:middle line:84%
You would say no, you want
to die, we'll help you die,

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.570 align:middle line:84%
but let's leave
the body out of it.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.870 align:middle line:84%
All you want is an
experience of death,

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be
followed by rebirth.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So we would somehow
work with them

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and actually activate
the unconscious

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:84%
where this matrix
is coming, and they

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.440 align:middle line:84%
will have the very convincing
experience of death that's

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:90%
been followed by rebirth.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So suicidal tendencies
of this kind,

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.010 align:middle line:84%
it's mostly for
violent suicide, they

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:28.550 align:middle line:84%
are there could be seen as
a confusion between suicide

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and egocide.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.730 align:middle line:84%
People want this death
of the ego followed

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:84%
by a major expansion
of consciousness,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:44.230 align:middle line:84%
as compared to death, which
is destruction of your body.
