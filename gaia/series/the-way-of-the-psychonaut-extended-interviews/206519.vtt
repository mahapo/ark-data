00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Maria Mangini.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I am a native of California.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I, because I was born in 1950,
was very easily influenced

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and very much exposed to
all the dramatic happenings

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of the middle and late
'60s and early '70s.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And I did all the
things that you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:84%
would imagine that someone
who was that age at that time

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
would do and could
do, including having

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
early experiences with
psychedelics before they became

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
illegal, in contexts that were
very much like what I have seen

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and imagined people to be
experiencing at Burning

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Man, which is an environment of
utter-radical artistic freedom

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and every other kind of
freedom, sexual freedom,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
general craziness, you know,
banging noise, loud lights,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
every kind of anything
you could imagine.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all happening at once.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's not much
structure to it.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I-- because, I
think, I was raised

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
with a very strong,
deeply religious education

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
by very thoughtful
Catholic religious,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
who really believed in teaching
the intellect as opposed

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to filling your
head with facts, I

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
had a very strong
idea about the Godhead

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and the preternatural gifts
and the pre-identified state

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and what the natural status
of humans ought to be.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when I experienced the
mind-opening characteristics

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.185 align:middle line:84%
of some of these
medicines, I didn't

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:90%
think I was losing my mind.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was seeing God.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.685 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I knew
I was seeing God

00:01:54.685 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because I had this
whole structure that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
was in place that confirmed--
that was confirmed

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:90%
by what I was experiencing.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was more
than 50 years ago.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And because those
experiences are,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
as anybody who has had
them will tell you,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
so inexorably true and
so extremely persuasive,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
the information that
was delivered to me

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in those experiences has pretty
much formed the rest of my life

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:90%
since then.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm 68 now.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%
That happened when I was 16.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So my entire adult life
has been influenced

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
by the psychedelic insights that
are available to anybody who

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
wants to open themselves
or has the occasion

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to open themselves to that.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
So I have a long story.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.707 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you for
an hour all the, you know,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
cool things have lain down in
front of me like little puppies

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
I start talking

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
about my personal history,
I myself self-start

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
wondering how it's
being received

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
by the person to whom I'm
speaking because there are so

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
many and there is so much
extraordinary good luck

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and adventure and
extremely helpful teachers

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and big personalities,
that you almost

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:90%
would think I was making it up.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes almost
think I'm making it up,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:90%
except I know I'm not.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I write a biography--
as I just did for a workshop

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be in
in a few weeks--

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I usually say, I've
worked with many

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of the prominent and significant
researchers in this field

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:90%
at one level or another.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:90%
You are a nurse.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a nurse practitioner.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And you also--

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:90%
you have a PhD in--

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let me go back.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually started out in
health care as a nurse midwife.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that I did that was

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that, when I encountered
Stan Grof and his work,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
he had just completed the first
book in which he describes

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:90%
the perinatal matrices.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And he, I think, was persuaded--
and he certainly persuaded me--

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that the biologic
experience of birth

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
has the potential to create
for both the woman giving birth

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and the person being born
a kind of template, which

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is a pathway for all kinds
of transformative experiences

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that might then
happen in the life

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
of that individual
subsequent to that birth.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's some
hard evidence for that

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.385 align:middle line:84%
in certain cases
that he sought out

00:04:32.385 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
or I've sought out, which I
won't go into at this moment.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But I-- remember I said,
I was born in 1950.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I came of age in
an activist Catholic school,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by religious
sisters who really

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
believed in social justice.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And my early education, aside
from the Catholic education

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that I've been talking
about, was also

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
about the common good,
the responsibility

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
that we have for the well-being
of the people around us.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
In specific, it was
about the civil rights

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:90%
movement at that time.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
But it later happened that my
civil rights movement friends

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
all started going to
Black Power parties,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and I really wasn't invited.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that the
common good was my business

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and that being an activist was
my identity also stuck with me

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and was more deeply
implanted-- or maybe

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
not more deeply but
earlier implanted

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in me than was the
psychedelic identity.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So when I encountered
Stan's realizations

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
about the environment of birth,
I really saw that as a place

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
where a person could put
some energy in a way that

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
would be really effective.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
That it was like a
fulcrum kind of point,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
where the investment of
energy would have resonance

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
in the society that would
be well beyond whatever

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:90%
you could personally touch.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And because my social
circumstances at the time

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
were such that I was
able to go to school

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and because I had a good
fundamental education

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
upon which to build,
I had the opportunity

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to go into nursing, which is an
amazingly spacious profession,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and study to become a
licensed professional attender

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
of deliveries, with
carrying along with me

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the ideas that I had learned
from Stan's theorizing

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
about what the
perinatal matrices were

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and what they meant.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And so I was able to do that.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I was able to actually make a
professional life for myself,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
in which I tried to help women
have the birth they wanted

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:90%
as midwives do.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was able to do that.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And as often happens
with midwives,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I kind of aged out of the
intrapartum environment

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
because it involves getting
up in the middle of the night

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.598 align:middle line:90%
and being able to make sense.

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of get
older than that.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very interested
in intrapartum obstetrics

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.905 align:middle line:84%
But then I got interested in
problems with reproduction.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Then I got interested
in problems

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:90%
with the menstrual cycle.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.548 align:middle line:84%
Then I got interested in
problems with the menopause.

00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm discovering now as
I'm approaching the age of 70

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the next iteration
of that same set of skills

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and insights is being interested
in death and dying, which

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
constellation of skills which

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.883 align:middle line:90%
is required to attend birth.

00:07:24.883 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
some kind of idea

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of what the map is
so that if, you know,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
people are wandering
too far off the path,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
you can maybe help them
to get back on the road.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But mainly you have
to be able to be with.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the big skill.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And the other skill is being
able to not let somebody else's

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
anxiety become your anxiety.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:90%
And I've practiced that a lot.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And it also kind
of came in handy

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
in and around different
kinds of psychedelic sessions

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been around
because it seems

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:84%
like that's also a fairly useful
set of skills for that as well.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But my professional
identity has evolved

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
in that same kind of like
seamless, no problem, one thing

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
If you proceed confidently in
the direction of your dreams,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
the path just opens
up in front of you.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.577 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of other things
that are very much of interest

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
to me, I think and
to you, have to do

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with Native Americans
and other Native people

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and other continuously
present cultures that

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
have been using different kinds
of psychoactive substances

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to their benefit for
a very long time.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of those things
are historically

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
recorded and remembered.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are dimly
understood to have happened,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
like the Eleusinian mysteries,
for example, about which we

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:90%
think we might know something.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But we don't actually
know anything

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because it was so, so sacred
that people were absolutely

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:84%
forbidden to talk about
what exactly happened there.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.222 align:middle line:84%
But when you know the kind
and character of experiences

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of certain kinds
of altered states,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
you kind of have to think that
just the way people came out

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of that experience,
something like that

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
must have been going on there.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And in order for it
to occur reliably,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:84%
it's very likely that there
was some substance that

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:84%
was employed to make
sure that people really

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.558 align:middle line:84%
got a shot at having
the experience

00:09:16.558 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:90%
that they went there for.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe
the Eleusinian?

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Eleusinian, this is--

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Eleusis was a temple in ancient
Greece, to which everyone,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
free or slave--

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe only
people who had killed

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
another person were excluded--

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
but everyone was expected to go
and go through this experience

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:90%
once in their lifetime.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was an experience
which took place at night.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It was under the influence
of some guides, who

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
had the custody of the
temple and the mystery

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
that was inherent
in that temple.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
When you see a Greek frieze
and it has that interlocking

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
pattern that looks like this
along the top and the bottom,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that's the hand of the
psychopump, the leader,

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
leading the initiant through
the maze of the mystery.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And people commonly had that
experience in that culture.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I think
there are probably

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
lots of other ancient world
uses for psychoactive plants,

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
about which we just
don't have a clue or even

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of a clue.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, there have been
various mummified remains

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that have been found
with cannabis plants

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.735 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually know
that detail in that way.

00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:90%
But I do know these things.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I know a few things.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I know that here
in North America,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
there are only a
few places where

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
no reliable supply of
psychoactive vegetation

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:90%
is available.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And in those areas, some
very different kinds

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of ways of changing
consciousness have emerged.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Like in the Northern
Plains, for example,

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
there are very many
extreme ceremonies

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
in which thirsting, fasting,
phonic driving with drums,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
photic driving with the
influence of the sun,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
dancing until you're exhausted
are used to bring people

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to a different state
of consciousness

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in a place where there are
hardly any psychoactive plants.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is not science.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:90%
This is my observation.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that people figure out
a way to get into those states

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
regardless.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But there certainly is
still a living culture

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:90%
of use of the peyote cactus.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
There still is a living culture
of the use of sacred mushrooms,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
even in the area
around the Great Lakes.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
At one time, Gordon
Wasson made contact

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
with an Indigenous
woman who presented

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
a kind of mushroom
ceremonial experience that

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
had its place in that
part of the world.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think many other things
that we just don't know about.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Ibogaine, for example,
which is tabernanthe iboga,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is the bark of a root which is
used as an initiatory process

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It's also used as an adjunct
to hunting because it

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:90%
kind of immobilizes you.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can sit motionless
by the waterfall for 24 hours

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:90%
or so until the game comes.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.777 align:middle line:90%
So it's got more than one use.

00:12:17.777 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there's the whole world

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:90%
of ayahuasca, which people--

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
many more people know a
lot more about than I do.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a plant,
salvia divinorum,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
which is used in
Mexico, which I think

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is one of the lesser-known
plants, psychoactive plants.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
There are lots of these plants.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we're just sort of
beginning to figure out

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%
DMT on its own now.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.873 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much
you could-- like,

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
for DMT, pretend

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you're a hummingbird
because pretty much

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
anything a hummingbird will
be attracted to has DMT in it.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of things that
have that red coloration

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
pretty much have DMT and
lots of other things.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.706 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
are everywhere.

00:12:58.706 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have had
the good fortune--

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I was married to
a man who was very

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
active in a lot of
Native American politics

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:90%
and other activities.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.955 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had of-- and
I also was the funding--

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I was the philanthropic chair
of Native American Projects

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
for the Seva Foundation
for well over a decade.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a lot of
opportunity to interact

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
with Indian communities in ways
that were extremely welcoming.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
In that tradition, one of the
kind of facetious things that

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
people say when they're
trying to introduce you

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
to their ceremonies
and have you not, like,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.188 align:middle line:84%
make too many faux pas, one
of the things that people will

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
often say-- and it kind of
sounds like a joke but a lot

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
of Indian humor has teaching
that's packaged in humor--

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, take off your shoes
and get to know your Mother.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is a suggestion
that the planetary wisdom

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and the biologic wisdom and
the botanical wisdom that

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
brought our ancestors
to have a high regard

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
for these substances
is here for us.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a
shaman to tell you

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
how many bat wings
to put in the brew.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be able
to listen in a certain way.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And that which knows
in the universe what

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is useful for those purposes
will reveal itself to you.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's--

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little at odds with
some of the sort of well-known

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
lights of psychedelic life,
who, you know, believed in--

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- people who
came from other planets

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
or ascended monkeys or I don't
know any of that kind of stuff.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
plants know a lot.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you're listening,
they'll tell you what they know.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that it's safe
to do this because people

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:90%
have been doing it for ages.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things
that are actually

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
missing or I feel are missing--
and I think I'm not alone

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
in feeling that they're
missing from the culture

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in-- are
associated with experiences

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
to do with these plants,
things like rites of passage

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
in which people get identified
as moving from childhood

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to adulthood,
under the influence

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:84%
of a psychoactive substance,
which then is used to open them

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to the teaching of
what it means to be

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
an adult member of the society
into which they are entering.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there are some
people who have figured out

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that some of the substances
that are available to us here

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:90%
now can be used in that way.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
There certainly is--
you know, hippies--

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
once again, I said
I was born in 1950.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Hippies knew a lot
of important things.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons that they did

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
was that they were
open to the things that

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
could be learned from
these kinds of experiences.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are a lot
of intentional communities,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
particularly here in the
Bay Area, where that need

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that young people sometimes
feel for that kind of validation

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
of their young adulthood
has been produced

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
with the psychedelic
plants for them

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
by their elders in little ways
and little communities that

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
got it, that that was
something important.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But what mostly happened
was molecular chemistry

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
revealed itself to
us in the first case

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
through the experimentation
of Dr. Hoffman.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I really strongly
want to say this.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And, Stan, if you're listening
and I'm wrong, I'm sorry.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But I would be willing to
give up my next week's pay

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to say I think I'm
right about this.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
At the Kabuki Hotel
long years ago,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
there was a conference that
many psychedelic lights

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
participated in.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Gordon Wasson was there.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Peter Furst was there,
and Dr. Hoffman was there.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was before his book,
"LSD: My Problem Child,"

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
had come out.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.377 align:middle line:84%
And I had at one time a
cassette tape of this,

00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and I loaned it to someone
who never gave it back to me.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot prove that
I actually heard this.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I imagined it.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But I believe Dr. Hoffman said
that a bench scientist, once he

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
or she has formed his or
her laboratory habits,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is not appreciably likely
to change those habits

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:90%
at any future time.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So the likelihood
that he accidentally

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
ingested LSD for
the first time when

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:84%
he had the first experience
that altered his consciousness

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:90%
is possibly not the explanation.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And that, in fact--
now, remember,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm the Catholic girl here
talking so transubstantiation

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.505 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
in my vocabulary--

00:17:48.505 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that the
substance was actually

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
transmuted in some
kind of cosmic way

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
into something that
was psychoactive

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:90%
because we needed it then.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It was right when people were
starting to get atomic fission

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and figured out we
needed something

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:90%
that would counteract that.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And maybe that's how we got it.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe he never
even said that.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
But I think I heard that.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And-- and then from that,
the people who-- then there

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
was the whole Gordon
and Valentina Wasson.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And Valentina was from
a microfluidic culture,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and Gordon was from a
microphobic culture.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
tension between them.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And as Gordon started
to get interested in who

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
was on which side of
that fence, people

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
who knew about mushroom things
started to make him aware.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up going
to Huautla de Jimenez

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:90%
and encountering Maria Sabina.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it was on the
cover of "Life" magazine.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, everybody
was looking at the psilocybin.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And somebody sent the
mushrooms to Dr. Hoffman,

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and he extracted or--

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- perhaps even
synthesized the psilocybin.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.645 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
it to Maria Sabina.

00:18:56.645 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, that's
the mushrooms, you know.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's been a lot
of that kind of stuff,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
the details of which
I don't actually

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
feel that I'm
enough of an expert

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to really be more than
a yarn or a storyteller

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:90%
about those things.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But the sacred container
and the cultural container

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in which the plant
medicines had always lived

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
opened at the point at which
these things started to come

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:90%
out of chemistry laboratories.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And they became accessible
outside the context

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:90%
of ceremonial life.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And people started to
use them, sometimes

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
for self-exploration
in a very measured way,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
in a very fruitful way,
and sometimes for kicks,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't got
anything against kicks.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of unsupervised
self-experimentation,

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I have learned from
experience, you

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:84%
have to have extreme
good luck to get

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:84%
the significant and
profound benefits that

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
can be obtained
from psychedelics

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of a setting.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, my research,
let's see, remember

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
what I said about the
matrix, the social matrix?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have to go back
and say what I mean by matrix.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Betty Eisner, who is one of the
early psychedelic researchers,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
she was an associate of
Oscar Janiger, in her--

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of the
early experiments

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
with some of the-- when
psychedelics were really

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
an esoteric practice
that was known only

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:84%
to a very small group of
pretty much intellectuals,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
she was one of the people
who was part of that circle.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But in later life, she also
wrote some very interesting

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
stuff, one of which
almost anybody who's

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
interested in this topic knows
the familiar formulation.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
That's drug, set, and
setting are the three factors

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that are likely to determine
the kind of experience

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
that a person will have.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But what Betty
Eisner suggested was

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that there was a fourth element
and that that was matrix.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And matrix, I think,
is extremely important

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
because matrix is the
social environment in which

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:90%
the experience takes place.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And just look at the
difference in the matrix

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
between now and 10 years ago.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an incredibly
different environment

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:84%
to approach the psychedelics now
than it was even a decade ago.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And a decade before that, it
was significantly different

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:90%
even from then.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This last 10 years has
been pretty rapid change.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But the matrix around which
this kind of stuff happened

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
changed drastically for me after
I reached my mid 20s or so.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And also I was really
starting to pursue

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:90%
a professional education.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And I moved from having
a work environment where

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.695 align:middle line:84%
I could smoke pot and
stay stoned and still get

00:21:48.695 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
the work that I
needed to do done

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
in a satisfactory way
to having to learn

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.685 align:middle line:84%
all the muscles
in the human body

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and the origin, insertion,
and action of each one of them

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
by heart in Latin.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't do that and
smoke pot all day long.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
a period where I

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't use very many
psychoactive substances

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
because it was inconsistent
with what I was doing otherwise.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But this is when I
was also starting

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to learn to be a midwife.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.612 align:middle line:84%
So I was involved in unusual
states of consciousness

00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
but just not ones that
were brought about

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:84%
by psychoactive
drugs specifically.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But the-- so these substances
have kind of always

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
been there for me
for the reasons

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that I told you because they
had a profound influence on me

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
in early adulthood.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And I always have understood
them to be perfectly safe.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty-- the primary
difficulty around their use

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
is that they're so
reprehended by the government

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, and that's
a part of the matrix we

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:90%
could do better at.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
What I am as a scholar,
as a researcher,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is an historiographer,
which means

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
my interest is in
the stories that

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:84%
are told about these
drugs and these substances

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and these plants and
who gets to tell them

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and how those narratives
are constructed,

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
with what kinds of
influences and biases

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that might be
introduced into the way

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that the stories are told.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So my research has
been to look at,

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
for example, the way
that different kinds

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of seminal events
around psychedelics

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
were reported in
the popular press,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or the way that claims that
were made about the psychedelics

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:84%
were either proved or
disproved as life went on.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And my specific topic for which
I did my doctoral dissertation

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.763 align:middle line:84%
was to ask people who are
contemporaries of mine, which

00:23:37.763 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
meant that at the
time I was writing it,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
they were 40 years
old or older, to talk

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
about what the impact
of psychedelics

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
had been on their lives as
they looked back, as people who

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
had used psychedelics before.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.162 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite a
broad sample in that

00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
there were people
in my sample-- it

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
was a pretty multicultural
sample, which

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I was very pleased about.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people in my sample

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't taken
any psychedelics

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:90%
for more than 20 years.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.065 align:middle line:84%
And there were
people in my sample

00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't taken
any psychedelics

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
for less than 20 hours.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
So it was a pretty broad group.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I heard from
them what the impact

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.840 align:middle line:84%
had been of the things
that had happened to them

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
under the influences
of these substances.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And people told me
heartstoppingly intimate stuff.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And, remember, this
is in the 1990s.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was really
very interested in any

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.707 align:middle line:84%
of this stuff, and it
was like asking somebody

00:24:32.707 --> 00:24:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to show you the slides
of their vacation.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just loved it
that you're interested in that.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I am really
interested in it,

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and people told me some very,
very wonderful things about

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the ways-- and also some scary
things about people who had

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
crashed and burned and some
people who had been harmed

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
by things that happened, largely
in conditions of unsupervised

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
self-experimentation, where
there was no one to reassure

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.235 align:middle line:90%
them that they--

00:25:00.235 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:84%
what they were seeing
and experiencing

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
was on a channel that
was not the same one

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:90%
that their body was receiving.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone to whom I
spoke talked spontaneously

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
without any suggestion,
inquiry, or prompting from me

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
about how much they
had experienced

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
their interconnectedness
with everything around them

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of everything generally.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases--
in many cases,

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:84%
people talked about how that
had changed their perspective

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
about what was ethical and
acceptable for them to do

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of their lives
because they saw that they were

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
connected in a way that they
had never really experienced

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't just
talk about opioids

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.613 align:middle line:90%
without looking at the matrix.

00:25:50.613 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons I wanted

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the matrix.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Opioid addiction in
the United States,

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.550 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, as
I started to say,

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
this statistic, which I think
is about three months old,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is probably out of date,
but when I got it--

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I got it from
someone at the CDC--

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
91 people a day in
the United States

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:90%
were dying of opioid addiction.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Now opioid addiction is
a disease of desperation.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I discovered this when I was
doing my doctoral research

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:90%
because I--

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
now this is really esoteric
nursing stuff, but there was--

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
in nursing, there was a
very important theorist

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
whose name was
Martha Rogers, who

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
developed these very
interesting unitary theories

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
of human experience
and human health.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.218 align:middle line:84%
And when I started reading
this stuff, I was floored.

00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, this
is nursing theory?

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Because she said things
like, human beings

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have energy fields;
they are energy fields.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And the energy field that
represents any individual human

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
is interpenetrating with the
energy fields of everything

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, this is
independently obvious to me,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
so I was clear that I was going
in that direction in nursing.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other
things that people in that

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of Rogerian model tend
to believe and talk about

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
is that drug use is a way of
increasing the amount of color,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
texture, vitality, interest,
commitment, life in your life.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And if there's very little of
any of that, getting altered

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and going somewhere else is
a reasonable alternative.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
have anything that

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
makes where you are an
attractive place to be,

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.477 align:middle line:84%
what in the world
would be a reason

00:27:40.477 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't want to go
somewhere else, possibly as

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:90%
fast as you can?

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
about opioids is

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that if you're swimming in
the sewer, you don't care.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the problem
that we have is

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
an opioid problem.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
We have a despair problem,
and we need to do something.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to do
something for people

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:90%
who are living in despair.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is it in treating
addiction that psychedelics can

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.520 align:middle line:90%
help to change that?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe that they're--

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
now not all
psychedelics are alike.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
psychedelics that

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:84%
have been identified
as being particularly

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:90%
good for this kind of thing.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to make a
general statement about that,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I would say they open--

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
they have the potential
to open people

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
to understanding what their own
motivations are for doing some

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:90%
of the things that they do.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And once they
understand those things,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.670 align:middle line:84%
they may not need
to do them anymore.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
how that works.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.795 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- I'm trying
to remember his name.

00:28:58.795 --> 00:28:59.595 align:middle line:90%
Richard?

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:02.742 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.742 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I should know his name.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's too bad.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:84%
He's the owner of the
Wilbur Hot Springs and--

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Richard Miller-- and he
developed the Smoke Enders

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
program, which is a weekend--

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
two weekends that people
spend at the Wilbur Hot

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Springs quitting cigarettes.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
successful program.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
When I met him, I really
wanted to kiss his feet

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
because as a clinician
who provides primary care,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I've recommended a lot of
people to go to that program,

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:90%
and it has helped a lot of them.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he has
saved a lot of lives

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.822 align:middle line:90%
by doing what he does.

00:29:37.822 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the things he does
in the Smoke Enders program

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is he gets people to
disrupt all the little habit

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
patterns that they
have around cigarettes.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.157 align:middle line:84%
So if they use-- if they
light them with a match,

00:29:46.157 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
he has them light
them with a lighter.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
If they hold them like this, he
has them hold them like this.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:84%
If they have a little ritual
of how they unwrap the package,

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
he has them do
something different so

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't this sort
of greased slide of habits

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that once you've started,
it's just like thoughtless.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up with
a cigarette in your mouth.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.565 align:middle line:84%
Even though you
have said, I want

00:30:02.565 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to extinguish this
behavior, you still

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:84%
do it because you're
on a patterned roll.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably
something like the place

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
where psychedelics operate
in interrupting addiction.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They get people to connect
to the unconscious things

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
that motivate activities,
which they know

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:90%
are not good for them.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, I have
a potato chip problem.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really have
a potato chip problem.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I know that I cannot get in a
car with an open bag of potato

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:90%
chips.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
I will eat the whole thing.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
feed-your-whole-company

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:90%
picnic-size bag of potato chips.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, I will
eat the whole thing.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Once I start putting those
potato chips in my mouth,

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can be saying, you
shouldn't really be doing this.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
This is going to make
you feel terrible.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
You said, you were never
going to do this again,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.995 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still putting the
potato chips in my mouth.

00:30:51.995 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me understand
how people can be addicted.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry if that's a
trivializing thing to say.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I
understand it, that

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:84%
like once the behavior
begins, it's like--

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a 12-step program.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But I hear from 12-step
people, people say,

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
"one drink, one drunk."

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, like you
can't even do it once.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It's-- and-- but you've got to
understand why you can't even

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:84%
do it once and what made
you want to do it once.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that insight
can really potentially change

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:90%
people a lot.
