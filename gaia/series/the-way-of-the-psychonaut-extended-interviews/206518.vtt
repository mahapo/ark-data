00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So shamanism, from the
archaeological and other

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:84%
evidence that we've
seen, appears to be--

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:84%
at least in the
European continent--

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
at least 30,000 years old.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
There's good evidence
from the caves in France,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
like Chauvet Cave and other
caves, that indicate there's

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:90%
a shamanic consciousness there.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
On other continents,
it may be older,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
for example, Australia,
among the Aboriginals.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And in Africa,
there's some evidence

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
from just sites,
archaeological sites, that

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:90%
have some shamanic indicators.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it has been very, very
well-described by many experts

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:84%
as the world's oldest
spiritual practice.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But shamanism-- so it's found
on every inhabited continent

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and was used by the people
primarily as a healing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:90%
methodology.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was also used as
a divinatory practice,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
in other words, to
contact these spirits

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and ask for help in
seeking food sources

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and other things that were
very important to the survival

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:90%
of the peoples.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So it has those two major
elements, I think, to it.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Some people confuse
shamanism with a religion.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not a religion--

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
it is-- because it's not a
system of faith among shamans.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Shamanic people tend
to be of animistic.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They have-- in other words, they
believe that there are spirits.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.572 align:middle line:84%
Shamans don't believe
there are spirits.

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
They know there are spirits
because they interact with them

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
and work with them
all of the time.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So but animism,
the idea that there

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
are spirits that you need
to placate and/or interact

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
with, that is more a--

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that is or can be a kind of
spiritual practice in religion.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But among shamans, it's
a very pragmatic practice

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with the
survival of the people.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Michael Harner was
an anthropologist.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:90%
That was his training.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
But he also had quite
a bit of background

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:90%
in archaeology and ethnography.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And what he had a very
profound shamanic experience,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
transformative experience,
among the people, the Conibo

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
people and the Shuar people in
Amazonia, Northwest Amazonia.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And through that experience,
which he wrote about in his

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
classic book, "The Way of
the Shaman," he discovered--

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
his major discovery was is
that there was another reality,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:90%
not so much--

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that was the thing
that opened him up.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, his experience
was through an ayahuasca kind

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of experience, which is what
the people he worked with

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
used at that time.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And he-- but after
that experience,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
he came back to
the United States.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
He has written papers and all
of that kind of thing, too.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But he came back to
the United States,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and he started
looking around for--

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of
research and actually

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
going to visit other
shamanic peoples.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And his mindset was is that it
had to be through an ayahuasca

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
kind of experience, you know,
that-- or some sort of a--

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
people call them entheogens
now but plant medicines,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
psychotropics,
whatever your term is.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But he was thinking-- that
was his mindset that it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:90%
had to be that experience.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered
in going around

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to all these different shamanic
peoples is that more than 90%

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
of the world's shamanic
peoples actually

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
use rhythmic percussion
sound, drums, rattles.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:90%
That these aren't just for show.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
That these are the things that
actually change the shaman's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
consciousness so that the shaman
can at will and with discipline

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
access these sources of reality.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And so in his
various studies, he

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
distilled from the
cultural overlay

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
because every
culture, of course,

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
has its approach
to this powerful--

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
this-- it's a very
powerful system.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So people have
their own deities.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
spirits they work with.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they're
working with a culture.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But what he distilled out
from his own knowledge

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and his anthropological
studies, too,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is that there were very common
fundamental principles that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
underlay all of these shamanic
practices that people had.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And that these methods,
methods, not cultural things,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
but these methods could
be taught and returned to,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
particularly Westerners,
now Easterners,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
too, people who had lost
their shamanic traditions

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
centuries ago, in
Europe, for example,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
during the Inquisition and
other things like that.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so his primary
focus was that this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
was a very powerful
system of being

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
able to access a profound
source of help, spirits,

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and bring that help
back to a very--

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
a troubled world.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many
problems we need to solve.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
to solve them alone.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's the general
background there.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The core principles
of shamanism--

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll just mention
a few and then--

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and one of the core
principles of shamanism

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of cosmography
of the world.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are
actually three worlds.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:84%
There's an upper world, a lower
world, and a middle world.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing
about those worlds

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is that the upper world
and the lower world

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
are entirely in what has been
called non-ordinary reality.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a term that
Carlos Castaneda used,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's useful, meaning, that
it's a non-consensual reality.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a different reality.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
It has different principles
that operate in those realities.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And the middle world
actually is dual.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a common
term that's used now.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But it has an ordinary
reality aspect,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:90%
which is a consensual reality.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can sit here,
and we can see how-- we

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:90%
can measure how much light is.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
We can measure each
other's weight.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
We could-- if we wanted
to, which we don't.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But we could do all of those
kinds of things, you know,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and we would come
out with an agreement

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:90%
on that kind of thing.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But it also has a non-ordinary
reality aspect, which

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:90%
is more of a spiritual reality.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And by spiritual, I
mean non-physical.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So in that reality, it's
inhabited by various--

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:90%
we call them spirits--

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.467 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
things that happen

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
in that non-ordinary reality
of the middle world, which

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is why we have some of the--
from a shamanic perspective--

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.170 align:middle line:84%
why there is spiritual
illness and other things.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you go-- the difference
with the upper world

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and the lower world is
that they're entirely

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
in non-ordinary reality.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And so far as we have
been able to discover

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and through hundreds
of thousands now

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of students journeying
and visiting these places,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:84%
this is inhabited by
fully-evolved compassionate

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Again, we call them spirits.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And so there is--

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that is-- they have
power and wisdom that

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is not readily available
here unless you know how

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:90%
to access that other reality.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the methods that
are taught in shamanism,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
that's what we teach.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We teach how-- we
teach a method.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you access
these other realities

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and learn to
communicate and relate

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
to very specific
beings, spirits?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
We call them either
teachers or power animals.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the general term.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
interact with them?

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And then how do you bring
that wisdom here and sometimes

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
bring that power here, for
healing, for problem-solving?

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people use it more in their
own lives for transformation.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Although shamanism actually
is not necessarily a system--

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not a system
of enlightenment.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
is transformation

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
is the outcome of doing it.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You use it in
service for others,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and you are transformed.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So there are several other
principles of shamanism

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I could tell you about.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But just the fundamental,
the first of all

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:90%
is the idea of the worlds.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
teach people how

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to contact particularly the
spirits of the upper and lower

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And we teach them what
to be aware of in terms

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of the middle world,
non-ordinary reality,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
because the spirits there
are not fully evolved,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%
and they can be troublesome.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like there are good
people and bad people,

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that some of the
spirits are not that--

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
some of them are not very
evolved, and they have agendas.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And the upper and lower
world spirits don't.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, we teach people
how to contact those spirits.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But then when we teach
shamanic healing,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with how
do you work with things

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
in the middle world.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to say, so
there are the worlds.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then one really fundamental
principle of shamanism

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is that everything is
one and is alive and has

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:84%
spirit, and everything,
even human-made things,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:90%
because everything is.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there-- just
there sometimes

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
in our advanced workshops,
we actually do a lot of work

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
with these different
aspects of reality where we

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:90%
do a kind of merging with them.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:90%
We merge to actually sense--

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to become that, to become it,
and to feel what it's like.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, one time I
did a very profound journey

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:90%
to the spirit of my computer.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those things where

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
it's just-- it was very
amusing at one level

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
because I ended up going
out through the internet.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
This was in the earlier
days of the internet.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience of
the oneness of all things

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:90%
through that simple--

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
what seemed to be simple process
of trying to understand that.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's a
principle of shamanism

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that shamans don't believe
again that they end up

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of practices,
where they become.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of a lot
of different cultural--

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
have different cultural
viewpoints of this--

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
but of people who
become one with an eagle

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
or become one with
whatever the animal is.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Or they become one with
a tree or whatever.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So in shamanic work,
what I've found

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the foundation
that I worked

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
with before the Foundation for
Shamanic Studies was devoted

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of all is one.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And we did a lot of
scientific study of it.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:90%
But the idea is is that--

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:84%
so we offered education,
in this former foundation,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
we offered educational programs
about oneness and about unity.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's certainly a
lot of scientific evidence

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
that you can use.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful
thing about shamanism

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it was all--
that in shamanism, you

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
can have the experience of
the oneness of all things.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
You can know it
deeply in your being,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
along with the scientific
evidence, which

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:90%
is also important.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism is a very
holistic practice.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you can
find truth, whatever

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
ways that you find
truth is good.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Shamanism is not the only way.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also a holistic practice
in terms of shamanic healing

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:84%
so meaning that there are
some things that medical--

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that medical practices
do very well,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes we need that.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you encourage
people to do that.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Other times, for--

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.868 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little distracted here--

00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:15.668 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.505 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all right.

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's just make sure it's gone.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So-- but so shamans and the
rest and other kinds of healers

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
work very well
together, you know.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So we practice those kinds of
holistic practices together.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
oneness of all things.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
There's the three worlds,
the idea of the three worlds.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the understanding
that shamanism

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
is an independent spirituality.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
One-- our focus
is teaching people

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to go directly to the source
of information and wisdom,

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
so there is no intermediary.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said,
it's not a system.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not a system of faith.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of shamanic
practices is that,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
through learning these
fairly simple methodologies--

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
although you have
to practice them--

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
you can access these very
powerful and wise spirits

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
or beings and learn how to
bring back that wisdom here

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to help others.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
at first, we--

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us, when
we start journeying,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
we spend a lot of
time talking to--

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
communicating with these various
spirits in these realities

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to learn for ourselves, to
say, OK, what am I doing here,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, and to get
personal help and advice.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of the
major principles of shamanism

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
is that you can--

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
once you connect
with this dimension,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
you yourself become a
more compassionate person

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
because these are
very fully-evolved

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
compassionate beings.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
You become a more
compassionate person,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
or you strive to become a
more compassionate person.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And also you realize--

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Michael used to say
that "we are not alone."

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he wrote an article
at one point talking about,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:90%
"we are not alone."

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But in my personal experiences,
what I've discovered--

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and what I've discovered through
a lot of students who I worked

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
is that we discover
that I am not alone,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that there is help
available to me,

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:90%
very wise compassionate help.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
No matter how bad things
get, you do not have

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to be alone in it, you know.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And you can rely--

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and these spirits
are, like I said,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:90%
they're fully compassionate.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But they also do
not have an agenda.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Their agenda, if
there is any agenda,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is to alleviate pain
and suffering here.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you can rely on them and
trust them and what they say

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:90%
and what they do.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's one
of the major transformative

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
possibilities that
shamanism offers.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, in working with the
Harners over many years

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and also teaching
students, when you follow

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
particular students-- and
in my own life, of course--

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:84%
you follow people
through this process,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
you see an ever deepening
sense of compassion.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
There is also-- that, I think,
is one of the main things

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that it can do for people.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You also, though,
notice that it--

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
practicing this and
being whole in your soul

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and having this
connection in this

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
gives you a kind of what
we call spiritual power.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
Power is a difficult term
sometimes for some people

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
because we've all
experienced abuse of power.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
But shamanism, when
you are working

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
with these
compassionate spirits,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
you start to understand a
little bit more, not only about

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
how the world actually
works, but you start

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
to have a much clearer sense
of your own work in the world

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to do
and how you want to help

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and what changes
you want to make.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And even with very,
very large problems,

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
you can get wisdom to help
you solve those problems.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
You also can very
directly go to the spirits

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and try to examine your own
blocks in your own life.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
What is keeping you from being
fully who you came here to be,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:90%
fully yourself, fully evolved?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.915 align:middle line:84%
And you can work on those
with the help of the spirits.

00:18:06.915 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a transformation in
people doing that kind of work

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But even more profound
is when people

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
are drawn to do some kind of
shamanic healing for others.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in being
service to others,

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that amazing changes
can take place.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say
that, although I've

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
seen all kinds of changes or
deep changes, profound changes

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
in students taking the
work, a lot of those changes

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
have come from
learning the method

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and then using it in
the world, not only

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
for yourself to transform
but also to offer healing

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to others, to solve
problems, to maintain

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
your own personal
power so that you can

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:90%
be very effective in the world.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot to do with
being very, very effective.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You get-- you gain this
kind of spiritual power,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
meaning your soul is fully
present in your body.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what you do
has more effect.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It has a larger effect.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.092 align:middle line:84%
And so there are so many
ways that that plays out.

00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the people who

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
are the recipients of
this, these healings,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
have their lives
changed in big ways

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
because they no longer are
suffering from whatever

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
the issue it is that they have.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And then more and
more of us now,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
since there are more
of us, are actually

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
using shamanic work to try
to help in world situations.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And I mean to try to come
up with pragmatic, practical

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:90%
solutions.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call the
divinatory component,

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
asking the spirits
for, OK, what's

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
some way I can help
in this situation

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and then playing it out
and seeing how it works.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's not-- it's not
about what we might call--

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
it's not about using
shamanism in a ceremonial way

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
or asking the spirits
to come do it.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We actually find ways
of enacting it as humans

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and evolving at the same time.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one
of the major things I

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
see in terms of working into
the future for shamanic work.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
From a shamanic
perspective, soul retrieval

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
has to do with returning
a person's personal power

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
From a shamanic
perspective, we humans

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
also have a spirit,
a personal spirit,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
which we have called
the soul, along

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
with all of the other things
that are living and not

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
living that have spirit
and soul at some level.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But from a shamanic perspective,
through just living life

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in this world,
you can be knocked around

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:90%
by life a bit.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
You can undergo certain
kinds of traumas.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We all know that this
is a difficult reality.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, part of
your essence or your vital life

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:90%
force can dissipate.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
If your soul is fully gone
from your body, then you die.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That's-- your soul
passes somewhere else,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
which shamanism also does
talk about sometimes.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Your soul goes someplace else.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And when your body is
gone, you no longer

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.405 align:middle line:84%
have that anchor
in this reality.

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But you can walk around
quite diminished,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
which is a source of--

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:84%
it can be a source of
vulnerability to illnesses.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes your
life very difficult.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Things that might have been easy
for you before suddenly become

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
very difficult.
Challenging situations

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
may cause you to get
even worse, you know.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So in shamanism, the shaman
can, through a methodology

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that we teach in our
courses, contact--

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
find-- look for and find this
lost essence of your soul

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and return it to your body.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a very specific
practice for doing that.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And once that soul essence
is restored to you,

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
then you have what
you might call--

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of it somehow
as a spiritual immune system.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So that life still is
going to throw challenges

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:84%
at you because that's the
nature of this reality.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have a kind
of resilience to them.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability
to say, OK, even

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
really, really difficult
things become things

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:90%
that you can use--

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
or not that you can use-- but
things that you can address

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:84%
in some fashion
because you have this--

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
you have this spiritual
immune system.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So soul retrieval is a very
important spiritual practice

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
because it allows you
to be fully present here

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:90%
but also in your full power.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make
your problems go away,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:90%
but it makes them solvable.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It makes them-- and
the people I know

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
who've done this,
who have really

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
gotten to the point
where their soul is

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:90%
pretty solid in their bodies.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you do this work, the
spirits work with you a lot.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes they leave
and spontaneously return.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So we call them soul
portions to you.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a simple example
that I sort of like to use.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not too
sure how apt it is.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:90%
But it seems to speak to people.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if you
think of yourself

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
as coming into this world as
like a 100-watt light bulb,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
you're very bright and
shiny, and all of this.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And through working
with life, you

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
get knocked around
so maybe you're

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:90%
walking around as 20 watts.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So a trained shaman can
bring back that lost--

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:84%
find and bring back
that lost essence to you

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and return it to you so that
then you are then fully able

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.700 align:middle line:90%
then to work through life.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing practice.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, it's-- in many
ways, it's quite simple.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:90%
The methodology is simple.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But as with all
shamanic practice,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the methodologies
tend to be simple.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But what makes the difference
is that a shaman with experience

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and who has very, very strong
relationships with the helping

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:90%
spirits.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Because the helping spirits--

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
these advanced spirits of the
upper and the lower worlds--

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones
who do the work.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
who do the work.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But they-- but we're very
important to the process.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
We work in partnership
with them because they

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
have a limited ability
to pass into this reality

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
unless one of us
invites them and knows

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:90%
how to bring that power here.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
We're in a reality where you're
thinking up or down, you know.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important principles

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that I think, if the reason
Michael went into this,

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is that he was
just-- from his first

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and his early experiences--
he was just awed by the fact

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that there was another reality.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
There was that-- we
think this is real.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And now and then,
we have experiences

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can't
explain, et cetera.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And that there was
another reality that

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
was totally different
from this reality, that

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
had its own integrity,
own rules, own guidelines,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And that if you could
access that reality,

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:84%
you could make this
reality better, you know.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So he was just-- he was
very struck by that.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of
evolving of us or using--

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and I can only speak to
shamanic methods really--

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to transform, then you do need
to have knowledge that people--

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
if you-- you cannot go
through this reality--

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:84%
you can go through this
reality naively open.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.992 align:middle line:84%
But you will invite to
yourself difficulties.

00:26:52.992 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
swimming in an ocean

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:84%
where there are a
lot of things that

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
can come your way without
any kind of knowledge

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
or protection.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so in studying
shamanic methods,

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
you learn how to access
these sources of protection.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we first
start with our work

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.212 align:middle line:84%
when we're teaching it, we
connect people with the--

00:27:13.212 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
what you call-- what
we've talked about--

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
is the up or the down
because those spirits

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:90%
are fully compassionate.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And once you have this
connection with them,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like having
a rechargeable battery.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You can plug into
that, and you have then

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
this source of power
and wisdom that

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
allows you to have
protection in this--

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
as you move through
this environment, which

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:90%
has this dual nature.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And you are then able to
not only have protection,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but you are able to more
successfully expand.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the amazing principles
to me about shamanism is that--

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:90%
and the way we teach it, too--

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
if you have an experience
with plant medicines,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
you might be cracked open, you
know, and be able to see that.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But Michael is-- his opinion
about that, having done both,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:90%
is that--

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is true
for me, too-- is that once

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:84%
you are open, then you also need
a methodology and a discipline

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:90%
to be able to work this.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.543 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- you--

00:28:24.543 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
some people, I
think, think, well,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I take some sort
of a drug, a plant.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
This is true in medicine, too.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
all my problems

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:90%
are through or finished.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:90%
That is only the beginning.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And so then you need
to find some way that's

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:84%
workable for you to
be able to do this.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, for example,
shamanism was a wonderful way

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
have a discipline,

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
to be able to use it to work
with others, and then the way--

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and then you get to the
point where you feel,

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm a totally different person
than I was when I started,

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.596 align:middle line:84%
you know,
particularly, I think--

00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I think I was always a little
bit sensitive to the world.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The world needs help,
and I wanted to help.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.755 align:middle line:90%
But I had not--

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know how
to do that or effectively

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:84%
in some senses how to-- how do
you-- how do I transform myself

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and what would that
transformed self look like?

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
What would it-- how
would I function?

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
beautiful things I really

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:84%
like about shamanism
is that I've

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:84%
started to look at my helping
spirits as my role models.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:90%
So they're-- from our--

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:90%
they're fully evolved.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:90%
They're compassionate.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't have agendas.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to be--

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:90%
they're kind.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll poke you
when you need it

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.852 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, it's not like
they're all lovey-dovey and all

00:29:55.852 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that kind of stuff, you know.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- this is not an
airy fairy kind of thing.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very solid,
very grounded work.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But most shamans I know are
extremely pragmatic people.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
fully grounded here

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to let yourself loose
to travel in those realms.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a beautiful
work to be involved in.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have so many wonderful
experiences, those touching,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.120 align:middle line:84%
loving experiences in small--
in large ways and small ways.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I saved the life of a squirrel
one time, going through a lot.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And I learned a lot from--

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I went through a whole process
with-- it's a long story.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And then a few
days after that, I

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
was at a workshop,
a shamanic workshop,

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:84%
in a wild-- kind
of a wild place.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was walking down the path.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what's--

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and I heard, like, footsteps.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And I looked back, and there
was a squirrel following me.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And it came up, and it
patted me on the foot.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It was another squirrel,
but I personally

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
think, OK, somehow these are the
mysterious little things that

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
That squirrel knew that I
was a friend to squirrels.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wasn't
looking for food.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It just patted me on the
foot, and then it went away.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is strange, you know.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But you have enough of
those kinds of experiences.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
how interconnected--

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
that everything is one.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a
spiritual dimension that

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is working hard, just
as we're working hard,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to connect with us and
wants us to succeed.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
That's how I think
of the spirits.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's a--

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- I'm always touched
by the ways, large and small,

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
that this dimension
works with us.
