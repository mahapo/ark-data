00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we both have been
interested in Native cultures,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
obviously, and the history
of use of psychedelic plants

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in the ritual,
spiritual context,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and also seen that it seems
that as a result of those

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
experiences, they have
tremendously profound

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
connection with nature,
sort of reverence to nature.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that modern society,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the industrial society, is
certainly missing, you know?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The way we have been treating
nature as something that we

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
depend on, as organic beings,
is certainly suicidal,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:90%
self-destructive.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Disrespectful, yeah.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wondered to what
extent your own worldview sort

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
of changed as a result
of your experiences?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I would say they've
changed completely, totally,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:90%
and irreversibly.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Irreversibly.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Irreversibly.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.487 align:middle line:84%
The reality-- I accept
the reality of spirits,

00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, so that's
the biggest thing.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that Michael
Harner, who was a good friend

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and colleague of both of us--
and he I think in his last days

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:90%
was also--

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
last years-- was also--

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
at that point, he no longer
felt he had to deny spirits.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:10%
He was like an anthropologist
within the accepted worldview.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:10%
And within the accepted
worldview that underlies all

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:10%
of social science to this day,
you cannot accept spirits.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't say that that's
parapsychology or spirituality.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get a
paper published.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You cannot get a paper published
or a book published in any

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
of the technical journals
unless you would say, well,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
people have this delusional
idea, blah, blah, blah,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:90%
about spirits.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's huge.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And that interests me, because
what does it mean, you know,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:10%
that we have this denial
of a spiritual reality

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:10%
that we treat nature
just as a backdrop?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's obvious.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
You can see the consequences.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't
have to respect,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
you just throw the
trash wherever.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:10%
>> And so, I'm actually at
the point where in comparison

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:10%
to the larger picture of
what's happening in the world,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:10%
and the crisis of what's
happening in the world,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:10%
and the need for a change
in attitude, the issue--

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:10%
in comparison to that
issue, the issue--

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:10%
the questions about
what kind of research

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:10%
should we do with psychedelics
seems petty in a way, actually.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:90%
They seem petty, you know?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I read the studies
about the hundreds

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of refugees
flooding into Europe.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Europe-- I'm a Native
European, as you are, and all.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And I see the European
countries being overwhelmed.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that changing.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's changing--
well, it's getting worse.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not stopping
no matter what.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I feel almost like, why am
I studying these drugs, you see?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:90%
It really gets to me.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I have talked to
several anthropologists who

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
spent some time doing
fieldwork with Native cultures,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and they had-- they had a
volume that they have wrote.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I
cannot publish it.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It would destroy my
professional reputation.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And the same--

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
even the new researchers
with psychedelics now,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:84%
they are avoiding mentioning
spiritual-- the fact

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that people have
spiritual experiences.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that has something
to do with the positive results

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:90%
of the--

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
of the studies.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, how do we
really change the paradigm

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:84%
if people will be tiptoeing
around a worldview that's

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:90%
screwed up?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting in
terms of the researchers,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
too, because I know some of
the researchers, as you do.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I was
always saying, well,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
the researchers who are
doing these studies,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
say with MDMA or whatever,
psilocybin, they shouldn't--

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel ethically they shouldn't
be doing them unless they've

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:90%
experienced it themselves.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But they can't include their
own subjective experience

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
in the study, even in the
application of the study,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:90%
because it would be dismissed.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It would be disapproved.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> They even go back to
the old nomenclature,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
like they talk
about hallucinogens,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
psychotomimetic substances,
experimental psychosis,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:10%
But really, you know, in the
case of, like, PTSD and MDMA,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:10%
MDMA is by far the best
medicine for PTSD, I think.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The MDMA is another one
in a special category.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think of it as
a psychedelic anymore.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't enhance
your sensory awareness.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:10%
It just opens the heart
center and allows you to--

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:10%
>> But most people
talk about entheogens.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, empathogens.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I coined the term empathogens,
which some people don't like,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds pathological.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's like
empathy generating,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.245 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously generating
under a certain--

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:90%
a therapeutic supplement.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.825 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just
taking ecstasy at a rave,

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't necessarily
include empathy,

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, it's a
different set and setting also.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the ideal treatment for--

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
substance for PTSD
and war trauma.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The military, who
are being treated

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with umpteen different
tranquilizers and so forth,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
they can actually access MDMA
themselves in the underground,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
just like they can
access cannabis.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.515 align:middle line:90%
This is an easy drug--

00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
it's widely available
in the underground.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
They can get it more easily
than the researchers can.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.327 align:middle line:84%
>> More American soldiers
committing suicide--

00:06:24.327 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Than being killed in the war.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> In Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's just
what's happening there.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But then, it continues
after they come back.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It continuous lifelong.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
At least they have cannabis,
which has been demonstrated--

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
now legally-- and MDMA,
sort of semi-legally,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's always that
distinction, see?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So how is the culture
going to adapt

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to coming up with
possible medicines

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to deal with these
unprecedented shocks and threats

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:90%
to the system?

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You said before
something very interesting,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:90%
that there's--

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
more is at stake
than whether or not

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:90%
we use psychedelics for therapy.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that the dimension
that's really missing there

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is to use it as a
tool to understand

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the psychic, understand
consciousness.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Something that would lead to a
radical change of the paradigm.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
We have the very narrow sort
of materialistic paradigm,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's a certain
way of using psychedelics which

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
does not sort of need statistics
and clinical studies and so.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at
the phenomenology,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and see what that says about
the dimensions of the psyche.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the radical change
of paradigm that--

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think to me, the most
basic paradigm shift that is

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
required and sort of indicated,
pointed to, is the recognition

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual dimension.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the dimension
that is recognized

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
by all the spiritual
traditions of the world,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and the shamanic traditions.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:24.947 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like a side
effect of these drugs, you see?

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can say, well,
they have these religious

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
experiences, because
then you're--

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual dimension
is the core dimension.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:90%
It's the core dimension.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not an add-on that
you can take or leave.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And that changes
everything, you know?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And so then the changes in
ideas and thought forms,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and the changes in
healing and so forth.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.483 align:middle line:84%
And you could say a
religious experience,

00:08:58.483 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
really cover it either,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
because the religions
are systems.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual--
and the shamanic.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
in the shamanic.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So the shamanic
traditions recognize

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual dimension.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.793 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the
spirits in nature,

00:09:10.793 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the spirits in trees,
and plants, and animals,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But the whole shamanic
work is predicated on that.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you find it in--

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily in the
organized religion,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
but you find it
in the mystical--

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the mystical--

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --branches.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%
This is a--

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --spirituality
that's all-inclusive,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that's all-encompassing,
non-sectarian, non-divisive.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And then in the Western--

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
traditions, they're

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:90%
a kind of mystical tradition.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And people like William
James, you know,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.360 align:middle line:84%
who recognized it and said
right at the beginning.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And in Buddhism, of course.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think the formula
that we all used, and still

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
use, of the set and setting I
think needs to be reformulated,

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:84%
because the set or the
intention is really the core.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And the set and the intention
determines the setting

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.717 align:middle line:84%
that you choose for
the session, of course.

00:10:09.717 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
a therapeutic session,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:90%
that's one kind of setting.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.513 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
do, like, go to a rave

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and dance and take
ecstasy, that's

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
a different-- a totally
different kind of setting.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the intention
is the total key.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing
research, or if you're

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
doing military research and
trying to brainwash people,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.475 align:middle line:84%
that's a completely different
intention, which I really--

00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I like to use that
as an example,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
because it brings home not
to focus just to start.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
There's an excessive
focus on the drug.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not really about the drug.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is sort
of, but not really.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.562 align:middle line:10%
It's very hard to
get that idea across.

00:10:44.562 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
People say, what
does this drug do?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, I can't
answer that question.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing with the drug
is a more interesting question.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a tool.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.195 align:middle line:90%
It's a catalyst.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:90%
A catalyst.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if you were
there when Humphry Osmond

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
talked about it, when there was
a question whether LSD is like

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
a panacea or whether it's
like the devil's drug.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, imagine
a discussion about a knife,

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Is the knife dangerous,
or is it a useful tool?

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Depends on who is
in the discussion.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it the--

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Cut the meat.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> --chief of--

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Stab someone.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:10%
>> --the New York police
talking about murders with it?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a Surgeon General?

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a, you
know, a housewife who

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:84%
talks about cutting
vegetables, or an artist who

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%
is talking about carving?

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- to me, I have
a-- instead of set and setting,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I use this formula
that has three stages.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said intention
is the first step,

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
because-- and then the
second step is like--

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I indicate that with an arrow.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:90%
The second step is attention.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Intention determines attention,
like where you pay attention.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting phrase.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, you pay attention.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.598 align:middle line:84%
In German, they say
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, it's a gift.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's something that you do.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just looking.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And so where you pay attention.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And like, we have the intention
to do these interviews,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and our attention
is focused on that.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But it could be
interrupted, for example,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
if there was a loud
noise or somebody

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
weird came in the room.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
That would be
interrupted, that step.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And then that
leads to awareness.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's also up in
the air, necessarily,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
because we could be doing
intention and attention

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and not be aware, because
awareness could be, like,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.115 align:middle line:90%
too distracted.

00:12:38.115 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I prefer now
to use that formula

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of set and setting.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It's more meaningful in
terms of the priorities.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
ask yourself, like,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:90%
what is the intention here?

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Always to come back to asking
yourself as an intention.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I know you and I have
had discussions about,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:84%
well, if you focus too
much on the intention,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and some intention, you
might miss some other stuff.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think we agreed
that you could formulate

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
your intention broadly enough.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:10%
So I want to heal this
issue, but I'm also

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:10%
open to looking at anything
else that my spirits want

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:10%
to show me, which I think would
be essential in terms of cases

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:10%
of trauma and stuff like that.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Ralph, you mentioned before
spirituality as an area where

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
we really have to radically
change our attitude

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:90%
in psychology.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
another thing that

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
dimensions of the psyche,

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.525 align:middle line:84%
and that's looking
at the negative side.

00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:84%
This is also-- there's a
major lived denial not just

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
dimension, but also

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
an incredible violence
of our species

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and where that comes from.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The only session where I had
myself a sense of a guide,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a transpersonal
therapist, I didn't see,

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
but there was an
energetic presence.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was a way of
communicating with ayahuasca.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:10%
This was the-- my only
experience when I had that

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:10%
sense of--

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:10%
otherwise, in my LSD
sessions, I had the feeling

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:10%
that the unconscious,
the individual

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:10%
and the collective unconscious
opens up, and then--

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't have the
feeling that there

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:10%
was any kind of a guidance,
except the inner self-healing

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:10%
guidance.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was not, you know,
personified in any way.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
To me, that question actually
it doesn't make any sense,

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, because it's
your worldview, you see?

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:90%
The spirits exist.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Spirits exist everywhere,
like in this room.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Human beings are spirits.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
We're all spirits, actually.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Animals are spirits.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Plants are spirits.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But there's another level
in which we have individuality,

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, spirits
have individuality.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:10%
And different traditions
access the spiritual realms,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:10%
but just because they access
the spiritual realms that

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:10%
doesn't make it
scientific, either,

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:10%
because you can make
observations or--

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:10%
I remember one of my teachers of
Agni Yoga, he once used to say,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.950 align:middle line:10%
like, he was a very high level
clairvoyant who could see

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of spiritual beings.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:10%
But he said when he
got a perception that

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:10%
was like a little bit
unusual, unexpected,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:10%
he would check it again,
and he would look again.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:10%
He said maybe six or seven or
eight or nine times, sometimes.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Am I really seeing this?

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just like anything else.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like ordinary perception.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I look out the window, and I
see two people walking down

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:90%
the street.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I look a little closer,
and after a while I say, oh no,

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was, like,
a man and a woman.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not a man and a woman.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It's two men, and one of
them is dressed as a woman.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and, you know,
so you're constantly

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
correcting perceptions,
constantly correcting.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And unusual perceptions need
more correction, obviously.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I have seen many,
many things like that

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
in psychedelic sessions, but
this was-- in the ayahuasca,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:90%
it was different.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a sense of a
present that was there for me,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and want me to guide
to it something.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was unique
in that session.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.148 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca has its
own unique beings

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:90%
that are connected with--

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of people

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> --medicine--

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> With mother, you
know, mother, ayahuasca--

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the madre.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> --feel something personal.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:10%
And with iboga,
for example, they

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:10%
think of it as mister,
more of a male presence.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so they make
distinctions sometimes.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.815 align:middle line:84%
Some of the-- the
mushroom spirits,

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
the people with the mushrooms,
the little ones, you know?

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Like Maria Sabina used to say,
oh, the little one, los niños.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're coming, and
they're laughing and giggling,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and wanting us to
have a good time.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And yes, of course,
those are-- now,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
we could say that's projection,
but I don't say that anymore.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.518 align:middle line:90%
I used to say that.

00:17:07.518 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, one time I was
guiding a session.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.750 align:middle line:10%
I was in a room in
Switzerland, which we'd

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:10%
used a lot for the sessions.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was guiding the session.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Music was going on.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't particularly talking.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I picked up some--

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
the woman on my-- on one side
was sobbing a little bit.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just reached
out a little bit

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:90%
to put my hand on her shoulder.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I did so,
I suddenly became

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
aware of this enormous black
presence right next to me

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It was like, sudden surprise,
but immediately calm.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel the
least bit threatened.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized it was
this enormous black dog.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
It was Anubis.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
It was Anubis in the form
of an enormous black dog.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:90%
He was perfectly still.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:90%
He was perfectly still.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why I had no shock
at all, just surprise.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately
empowerment, a sense of, like,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is real.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
He's actually guiding
me in this-- in our--

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:90%
in this session.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one of the
experiences that kind of

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
eliminated my last sense of,
well, I'm just making this up,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.995 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:10%
It's, like, disrespectful to
say that you're making it up.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes
you do make it up.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's a practice.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So then practice is
distinguishing between what's

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:84%
a real vision and what's
a delusional vision?

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Buddhism
is all about that.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
You keep checking.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You keep checking over
and over, and testing,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:90%
and checking and testing.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the scientific method.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I have been
repeatedly surprised when I was

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
able to verify certain things,
that this was more than just

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:90%
a fantasy or a hallucination.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
There is somewhat
of a tendency--

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Including historical
past life experiences and--

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, which are hard to verify,
but, you know, nevertheless.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And things that people had
identification with animals,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and they came up with new--
completely new insights that

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be correct.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd like to return
to this meeting,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:10%
the CIS when you said
that in the early sessions

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:10%
in Millbrook, you were so
surprised and, in a way

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:10%
horrified, with the nature, the
gory nature, the bloody nature,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:10%
the violence that was
in those sessions.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.145 align:middle line:84%
And you said that your
knowledge of psychology

00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and psychoanalysis really
didn't give you any clue.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And the same happened to me.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that within
myself, and then one person

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
after another, and found
out that enormous amount

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:84%
that violence was actually tied
to the experience of birth,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:84%
through the hours
in the birth canal.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, even, from
the transpersonal level.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The archetypal domain is also
a powerful, negative charge

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:90%
frequently.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So could you say
more about that?

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
My perception of that
has evolved a little bit.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to talk about,
because I would say now that--

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I totally recognize
the connection

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of this violent, physical
biological imagery

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:90%
to the perinatal, to the natal--

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
to memories, body memories
of the natal experience.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of inescapable.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:12.272 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it's
an adult recognizing it, see?

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- you have to make a
distinction between the child--

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the fetus being born
is experiencing that.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They're experiencing
something, body sensations.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:10%
They have--

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:10%
>> They know only what your
experience is as an adult when

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:10%
you are living it.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, when you're
really living it.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then-- but then,
there's a further extension

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:90%
of what you just--

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%
what you stumbled on, so to
speak, which is, like, well,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
then how did that relate to
the collective consciousness?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:49.196 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean that
everybody on the--

00:21:49.196 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
on the planet is being
born under these horrendous

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
circumstances, and people are
having these extraordinarily

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:90%
painful experiences?

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't seem right,
either, because there

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
can be traumatic births and
not-so-traumatic births.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.213 align:middle line:84%
But that still
doesn't explain where

00:22:08.213 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
the-- where this relentless
violence and war comes from.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's, like-- that's
a really difficult question

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a
follower of Gurdjieff.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I like-- you know,
and he wrote some

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
of his most challenging
and far-reaching things

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
about that and
the origin of war.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into
evolutionary and planetary

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Planetary history and even
solar system or cosmic history,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and stories about invasions
from other planets.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a follower--

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm a student of the
work of Zecharia Sitchin.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
into his stuff,

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
then this is the place where
the vast majority of ordinarily

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
educated people just say,
oops, he's gone over the edge,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:10%
Zecharia Sitchin talks
about a planetary history

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.433 align:middle line:10%
that this planet was
civilized and civilization

00:23:14.433 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:10%
was established on
this planet by people

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:10%
from another planet called--

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.388 align:middle line:10%
>> You're talking about the
images in the Babylonian.

00:23:19.388 --> 00:23:22.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Nibiru, the planet Nibiru,
that we were a colonized

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:23.285 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then that leads to a
reinterpretation of all kinds

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
of archaeological findings.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It's vast, you know.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge subject.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, contemporary
data about

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial visitation.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I've just actually written a
book-- it's in manuscript form.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.448 align:middle line:10%
I haven't published it yet--
where I'm going further.

00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:51.365 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this one book
called "The Roots of War

00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and Domination", which
I think you have.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm looking
further and further.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of obsessed
with this problem.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because I was
a war child, like you were,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and all my life I've
thought that somehow

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
solving the problem of war, it
has to be part of my mission.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And I know that's--

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:90%
we have that same thing.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And I looked-- I
looked at three--

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
four mythic stories of violence,
where violence became out

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of control.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, I kind of went
into an addictive pattern.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Addiction to
violence, unstoppable.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And two mythic female--
female mythic figures,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:10%
and two male mythic figures.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:10%
So the female ones
are, like, Kali is one.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
She's a Bengali goddess, and
you have big posters around her,

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and she's like, kah, Like that.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fantastic story
behind that where the stories

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:90%
are waking up stories.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- I don't
know if I can-- well,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll give this
one as an example.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So an Indian guru that I knew
in the '60s told me the story.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:90%
You see these posters.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:90%
You'd see these posters of Kali.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
She's standing on the body
of her husband, Shiva,

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
lying on the ground.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And her tongue is hanging out,
and it's kind of blood drop--

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:90%
you can see fangs.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Blood is dripping
from her fangs.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And she's got, like, multiple
swords, and cut-off heads,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:90%
a garland of cut-off heads.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, like this.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And the story that
this woman explained

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to me, which is really
amazing-- and these posters

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:90%
are all over Bengal.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like, during some time
in the cosmic cycles of Kali,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
who is a consort of
Shiva, was on a rampage.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.905 align:middle line:10%
In other words, Kali on a
rampage means there are wars,

00:25:53.905 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:10%
but beyond that,
there are, like,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:01.252 align:middle line:10%
earthquakes, floods,
hurricanes, tornadoes, fires,

00:26:01.252 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:10%
all this kind of thing.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh, god,
Kali's on a rampage.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
People dying by the
thousands, by the millions,

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%
planetary collisions.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And so she's on a--

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:90%
she was on a rampage.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And the myth goes the gods--

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.635 align:middle line:84%
the local gods came to Shiva
and said, Shiva, Lord Shiva--

00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, how they
tell these stories--

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Lord Shiva, you
must do something.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Your wife is going crazy.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Basically that's
what it comes to.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Only you can stop her.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Please, oh Lord Shiva,
save us, because she's

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:90%
destroying our worlds.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And so Shiva, he roused
himself up out of, like,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a 40,000-year meditation in
samadhi and moved over to where

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Kali was and threw himself
on the ground where she was--

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and then when she stepped
on it-- stepped on him,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:90%
she went (SHOUTS) and woke up.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Because he represents
consciousness,

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and she was representing blind
rage, out of control rage.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:90%
She woke up.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a fantastic story.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
See, blind rage is a contracted
state of consciousness.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't see anything
except what you're kaak.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Berserkers in Germany,
the Celtic warriors,

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:84%
their stories of Germanic
and Celtic warriors

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:84%
going into this rage
state where they

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.855 align:middle line:84%
couldn't stop killing, and
killing everybody, friends,

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:90%
foe.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.996 align:middle line:90%
Just anything.

00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Then how do you stop
something like that?

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
situation we're in.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think those--

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Awakening of consciousness.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --would be not easy to deal
with these kinds of dimensions

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:90%
from a--

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
dimensions from a
practical point of view.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.015 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:47.015 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Well--

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think looking
at the perinatal source,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that's something that we could
do something about if at least

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the profession recognizes
that that element is there.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are sort
of practical methods

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that we could use, including
changing birth practices

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is amazing
that currently,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:10%
the academic circles don't
accept the possibility that

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:10%
birth, the hours in the birth
canal, that they are a trauma.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is--

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> They are certainly beyond it.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It is the transpersonal
dimension.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And I don't know if you--

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there is some--

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --would also consider
the astrological dimension

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's even more far out.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of-- but
there is some awareness,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and there is some
work that recognizes

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the traumas of birth,
and then the memories

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:90%
of birth and working on those.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:90%
But it's not--

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Not the official,
you know, like--

00:28:52.122 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not well-known, yeah.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I know there was
some marvelous work.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:10%
I remember there was a group--
and I don't know if it still

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:10%
exists as a group-- in Russia,
actually, of physicians,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:10%
and midwives, and mothers and
fathers, couples, basically,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:10%
who would go to these--

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:10%
who went to these birthing
camps on the Black Sea.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%
You probably read about that.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, where they
went to the Black Sea

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and gave birth in the Black Sea.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But they preceded it by
having training sessions

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:84%
with the people, having them go
through breathing and practices

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:90%
and all these kinds of things.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.602 align:middle line:90%
And they made a film.

00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
spiritual there.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
They were all, like,
religious people.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They went-- they had the
mother go through all her birth

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
trauma.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And long before the--

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd run the conception, groups,
and all this kind of thing.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And then they had
birthing in the--

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:10%
in warm water, the
water of the Black

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.810 align:middle line:10%
Sea in the summer months,
of course, with dolphins

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:10%
swimming around and multiple
women and children attending.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You're talking about the--

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:90%
inspired by Charkovsky?

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Igor Charkovsky?

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was one
of the initial--

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:90%
but this was--

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I forget the name of
the woman, but initial--

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and there is this
amazing film where--

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and she was a midwife
herself, trained midwife,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Tanya whatever her name was.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And she's giving birth in
a kind of a birthing tank.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.700 align:middle line:84%
They had a birthing tank,
totally without any anesthetic.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
She already had two small
children, like 3 and 5

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:90%
or 3 and 6.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're just playing
around watching her.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
She's totally
without anesthetic.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.587 align:middle line:90%
She's in this birthing tank.

00:30:40.587 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Her husband is filming it.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:10%
And she's looking right
into the camera and smiling.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And she's birthing
the baby herself,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.240 align:middle line:84%
putting her hand
between her legs,

00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:00.850 align:middle line:84%
pulling it out, smiling
seriously, friendly way,

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
looking at the person.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And you see that, and
you think, oh my god.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is, like--

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
then you think about these
myths about the curse, you know,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that there was a curse on birth.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Bible.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:90%
There's a curse on birth.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
realize that the Bible,

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
there's actually Yahweh,
curses the mother.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
In pain you shall give birth.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So because of God, because
he demands it, commands it,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:90%
because you did something bad.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
that, and you see

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
any-- you know, these children
that have been born that way,

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
they don't have
the violence gene.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's gone recessive.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't have it.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.970 align:middle line:84%
You can-- they can't fathom
the idea of violence.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:10%
And they also can't fathom
the idea of insincerity.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:10%
They must-- you know, they
watched some of these children

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:10%
grow up, and they just
look at you, and they--

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:10%
they just don't
relate to insincerity.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they're like
forerunners in possibilities.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned something
else that was very interesting

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
looking at the whole
history of humanity.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
psychedelic sessions,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, I found out that
when the regression goes back

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to the perinatal
level, that it suddenly

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
opens up into this
big, big scene of the--

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
of collective violence,
sort of scenes from battles

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and revolutions and so on.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And Chris looked
into it, Chris Bache.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in his book, "Dark
Night, Early Dawn", that maybe

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
when we get to that
point that we are not

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
doing personal therapy
anymore, but that it's

00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
more like a sort of cleaning
of the consciousness

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:90%
of the species.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:84%
That if you see the
enormous violence that

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is happening, that it
leaves some kind of traces

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:90%
in the collective--

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.100 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:84%
field of collective
consciousness,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and that those of us who
are doing this kind of work

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
are maybe in some sense
helping to clean that field.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It'd be nice, nice
to think about it.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>> From a sort of
scientific point of view,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:84%
or a participant observer model
of consciousness, which is--

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is clearly
arranged in layers.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing personal
work, and then we

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have the layer of family
work and all the patterns

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.402 align:middle line:84%
that we share with the
people in our family.

00:33:54.402 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the patterns
that we share

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:84%
with the people in our culture,
sort of cultural unconscious,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
archetypal-- cultural archetypes
shared by all Americans,

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:84%
let's say, or Protestants,
or Catholics and so forth.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next layer down
would be all of humanity,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
archetypes like birth and death,
mammalian birth and death.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you can sort
of even go by mammalian,

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.279 align:middle line:84%
you know, and then
vertebrate animals.

00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:27.570 align:middle line:10%
You can divide down the
different stages, you know,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.340 align:middle line:10%
and you can tune
into all of that.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.570 align:middle line:84%
That's something that we
share in common with all life

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, even
beyond, when we're--

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.429 align:middle line:90%
so reptilian and all that.

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And then also
when-- then we'd get

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to the level of the
planet and the biosphere,

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and the planetary patterns of
atmosphere and water and Earth.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.403 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd get beyond
that to-- the earth

00:34:50.403 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:90%
is part of the solar system.

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the solar system has its
own level of consciousness.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.217 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably a divine
spirit for the solar system.

00:34:57.217 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Of course there are.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:34:59.592 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
people talk about it,

00:34:59.592 --> 00:35:01.170 align:middle line:90%
well, God is the sun, right?

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And then, well, why stop there?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
How could it not be
that it would continue?

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
How could you have a divinely
inspired solar system

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and then not go
on to the galaxy?

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's the
galaxy as well.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the clusters
of galaxies, and then

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the meta clusters of galaxies.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.025 align:middle line:84%
So it's infinite
in all directions.

00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it's infinite
in the other direction

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:90%
down, down, down to the--

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, you've
got the organ level, and then

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the cellular level,
and the molecular level

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and the atomic level,
and the subatomic level,

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.593 align:middle line:90%
and the pure energy level.

00:35:38.593 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what the people
have always said,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.468 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we use that language.

00:35:41.468 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's all there.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It's all accessible
and possible.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you see what we can
actually do to deal with this

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:10%
violence?

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.148 align:middle line:10%
>> To deal with the violence.

00:35:59.148 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like it
has always been there,

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:90%
this enormous violence.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It cannot be explained
even from biology.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Erich Fromm wrote
this book, "The Anatomy

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of Destructiveness" that the
human violence goes way beyond

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
anything that you
see even in nature.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And we reached a level where
we cannot afford anymore.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We would not make it,
and we would not survive.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So do you see any that
we could do practically?

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the-- yeah.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an answer.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.860 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the understanding.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:84%
If you enlarge your
understanding to accept

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there's this
programmed-in genetic--

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:84%
there's a genetic defect
somehow programmed in.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Evolutionary process is
taking place on this front.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you have humans have
basically colonized and taken

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:90%
over the entire planet.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying
to run the planet,

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:84%
basically, without
having a clue,

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, of how to do it.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Or they're trying to
learn it as they go along.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And-- but in the
meantime, they're

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
exploiting all the resources
and destroying the planet.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So, well, nobody
knows, you know?

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The planet will
survive, of course.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Civilization, likely not.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
See, I think Western
civilization likely

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:90%
will not survive.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Other civilizations--
that's no big deal.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Other civilizations
have existed before us

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and have gone, like 20
or 30 different ones.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone extinct with
massive loss of population

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and massive loss of habitat.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, unfortunately,
spirituality doesn't sort

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.320 align:middle line:10%
of give you a clue, because
you have-- on the one hand,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:10%
you have the concept of the
yugas, Kali Yuga and so forth.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you have
Aurobindo, a very positive sort

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of idea that the spirit's sort
of coming and spiritualizing

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:90%
in the material world.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we are supposedly
moving from the Kali Yuga

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.625 align:middle line:84%
to the next yuga, the
Tetra or whatever it is.

00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Then there's two or
three on a period.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But the yugas actually
don't really address that.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's still wars
and conflicts going on.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:90%
But I guess the idea was, like--

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
but I think in many ways,
that's the core conflict.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- the planet
and the biosphere

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
can't survive if the people,
if the dominant species,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:90%
is fighting each other.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:10%
>> The biosphere's survival
needs the people who are

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:10%
collaborating, needs
everybody to be collaborating.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the rule.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
the sense, I think,

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I have of that's
when-- in order for us

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to get help from other beings,
other planetary systems,

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
other more advanced
civilization--

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
of which the universe
is undoubtedly

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
teeming with millions
of other civilizations

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that are far advanced of ours,
never mind whether they've

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:90%
actually visited here.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:16.980 align:middle line:90%
They know us.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.600 align:middle line:90%
We're being observed.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.020 align:middle line:90%
We're being visited, of course.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's a kind of criterion,
you know, no intervention.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to figure it out.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.030 align:middle line:84%
If you make a mess
of it, well, too bad.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Souls are immortals, of course.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Souls are immortals.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:36.265 align:middle line:84%
>> For the
cooperation, you know,

00:39:36.265 --> 00:39:40.530 align:middle line:84%
we have been going to many, many
countries doing the breathwork.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's always a very
hopeful kind of experience

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to see that on a deep
level people really

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
want to live in peace
and harmony and so on.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%
There are of course
forces on some other level

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that make it very
difficult, but there

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.930 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a really
willingness when

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:84%
you meet ordinary people
rather than those warmongers--

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> The leaders, yes.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You know.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's the beautiful thing.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a generally
sort of positive--

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> --or negative feeling?

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:90%
People don't want very much.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:25.720 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they want enough
food to live and survive,

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and they will be at peace,
and raise their family

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and raise their
children, and maybe have

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
some meaningful work, of course.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that would-- and be free
to unfold their creativity.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, potentially if
we solve these problems,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.730 align:middle line:84%
this could unleash
so much creativity

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and then communication
with other worlds.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
See, once-- so the
vision I have is,

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
like, once we work
out the war thing,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
then we can-- and we can
ask, and we're getting help

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.820 align:middle line:84%
in trying to do that--
but once we work that,

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:90%
then we can open ourselves up.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, now teach us, you know?

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Teach us like how
to really work--

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.160 align:middle line:84%
how to live on a planet in this
universe, in this solar system.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:90%
