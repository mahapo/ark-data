00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1981, my first book,
"A New Science of Life,"

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:84%
was published in England
but not in America.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And I received a letter.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I received quite
a lot of letters,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
letters I received

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
was from someone I'd
never heard of, Stan Grof.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I was working in India in
an agricultural research

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:84%
institute, and Stan Grof wrote
me a long handwritten letter

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
saying how much
he liked my book,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
he'd had a copy shipped to
California from England.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:84%
He was really excited about
the idea of morphic resonance,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
which is what I was
describing in the book "A New

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Science of Life."

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me to speak at
a conference he was organizing

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
in Bombay for the International
Transpersonal Association

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:90%
in 1982.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I think it was February 1982.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote
back saying, well,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate the invitation,
but it's harvest season.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I've got my crops
being harvested.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the peak harvest season.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a major series
of experiments going on.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.237 align:middle line:90%
I can't really leave it.

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, why don't
you just come for two days,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and we'd really like to hear
about what you're saying.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So I took two days leave.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I took the overnight train
from Hyderabad to Bombay,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and I went to this conference.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I entered a wonder
world that I'd never

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%
encountered before.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd lived in the US
for years before that

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
when I was at
Harvard for a year,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
but I'd never been
to California.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And since my time
at Harvard, I'd

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
been in Cambridge doing research
and teaching at the university,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd been in India for
about five years after that.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And I knew nothing about
the world of California.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of things
like the New Age Movement.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of Stan Grof.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard of Esalen.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in this
room, in this hotel,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
was a kind of astonishing
world of people

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
who are into
consciousness research,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
Esalen Institute.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Stan was talking about his
psychotropic breathing and LSD

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:90%
research, and so on.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a completely
new world for me,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and rather exciting, because
a lot of what I was doing

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:84%
seemed to fit with
what they were doing.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And at that meeting,
which was called

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Wisdom and
Modern Science,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I was talking in the
modern science part,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and Jill Purce was talking
in the ancient wisdom part,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
because she'd known
Stan for some time.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And I met Jill there, and
she's, of course, now my wife.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was through
Stan Grof that we met,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and Stan then invited
me to go to Esalen

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
later that year, when I got
back from India to England.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I then went on to California.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was running a
month-long program at Esalen

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
with teachers coming
in from different--

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
all around the world and
with students who were there

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
for a whole month, including
psychotropic breathing, which

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I did with him.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed to find
myself in an environment, where

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about the things
I was really most interested in

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and where people were
interested in finding out

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
more, a kind of fizz of
excitement and discovery

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:90%
and new horizons.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:10%
It was a-- and that really--

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:10%
as a result of Stan, I sort
of parachuted into California.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And there, I met a lot of people
working along similar lines--

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
unions, researchers
in psychedelics,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
researchers, and so on.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
interested me about Stan's work

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
was his emphasis on the
collective unconscious,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
a kind of collective memory
on which we all draw.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And this fitted very well with
the idea of morphic resonance,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there's a
kind of collective memory

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
in each species.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
He thought that people
in psychedelic or

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
psychotrophically altered
states of consciousness

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
were accessing this much
larger realm of consciousness

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:90%
than the individual psyche.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And he gave many
examples in his workshops

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and his writings
of people accessing

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
other forms of consciousness
beyond the human level.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that made sense
to me, because I was--

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I think in terms of many
forms of consciousness

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
in nature and also in terms
of collective memories.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And Stan had done research on
people doing LSD experiences

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and also through
psychotropic breathing

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and found that there were
certain archetypal patterns

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that recurred in those,
including what he

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:90%
called the perinatal complex--

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.610 align:middle line:84%
death, the sort of squeezing,
the going through the birth

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
canal out into the
light, which is reflected

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
both in the
near-death experience

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and also in many people's
psychedelic experiences.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, he wrote a book
about this sort of thing

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
in a series of books edited
by my wife, Jill Purce.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:84%
His book, "Near-Death
Experiences--"

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten the exact title--
it's in her Art and Imagination

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Series.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So she was the editor of one of
his main books on this subject.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So Stan also had a broad
view of the possibilities

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
for psychology and extending
it beyond the individual level.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the very title of his
organization, the Transpersonal

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Psychology Movement,
is about consciousness

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond the human level.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is an area that
was, of course, totally

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
neglected in academic
psychology in the 20th century,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
except for people who followed
in the tradition of Jung.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:10%
But Jung was concerned only
with the human collective

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:10%
unconscious, whereas
Stan extended this

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:10%
to other forms of consciousness
beyond the human level.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
In this sense, I think he was
doing immensely pioneering work

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and was very brave
to do so at a time

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
when these subjects
were more or less taboo.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:10%
In many ways,
consciousness studies,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:10%
as it's now developing
in the 21st century,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.410 align:middle line:10%
is carrying further some
of the lines of research

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:10%
that Stan started and pioneered.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The idea of morphic resonance is
something that came to me first

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in Cambridge when I was
doing research on plant

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
development in the 1970s.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I arrived at it through
thinking about how plants

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
grow their forms, how leaves and
flowers and shoots and branches

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:90%
develop.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I was working at the forefront
of cell biology and plant

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
biochemistry, working
on the hormone, auxin,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
most important hormones.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's-- indole acetic acid
is its chemical name--

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is related to tryptamine
and serotonin.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was working
on this hormone.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:10%
I was working on
plant growth, but I

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:10%
realized that we were never
going to understand form

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:10%
just in terms of chemicals and
diffusion gradients and gene

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:10%
activations and so on, all
the standard mechanisms

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:10%
that my colleagues
were intrigued by.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
we needed a concept

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of morphogenetic
fields, an idea that's

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
been around since the
1920s, form-shaping fields.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
While I was thinking
about them, I

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:84%
was wrestling with the question
of how these could be inherited

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
since they're not in the genes.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
How could something--
a pattern, a form--

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that's not in the
genes be inherited?

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It took me months wrestling with
this, maybe two or three years,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
before I had a sudden
flash of insight

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
that this could happen if
there was a sort of resonance

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
across time and that
organisms tapped

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
into a kind of
memory of form, which

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
I called morphic resonance.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Resonance is because of
similarity and "morphic"

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
to do with form or shape.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
had that idea, it

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
became clear that many
aspects of memory inheritance,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
collective memory,
would make sense.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It would mean that each organism
drew upon a collective memory

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
of its species.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It would mean that form and
instincts in plants and animals

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
were inherited through
morphic resonance

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
rather than genes,
which is simply

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.360 align:middle line:90%
code for protein synthesis.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
capacity to underlie

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:90%
most biological inheritance.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:10%
And this idea had many
implications for psychology.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So the basic idea is that
similar self-organizing

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
patterns of
organization influence

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
subsequent similar ones by
a resonance across space

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of
memory in the universe.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
In its most general
form, this hypothesis

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
says that the laws of
nature are more like habits,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has a memory,
and there are evolving habits.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Conventional science in
the West takes the view

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has
no memory, and it's

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
governed by eternal
laws, which are somehow

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:90%
outside space and time.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
That, perhaps, made
sense before 1966,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
when people thought the
universe was eternal.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But we now have a radically
evolutionary cosmology starting

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
with the Big Bang, and
the entire universe

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:90%
is now evolutionary.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that laws
of nature might evolve

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
may seem quite
probable, but I don't

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
like the idea of law
of nature, because it's

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
very anthropocentric.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Only humans have laws.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, any civilized
humans have laws.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Habit is a much more
general metaphor,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a better one
for the regularities of nature.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So morphic resonance
is the hypothesis

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of collective memory of laws
of nature as like habits

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and a transfer of information
across space and time

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
by a process of resonance.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of its more
shocking implications

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:90%
is that our normal memories--

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
just remembering what we did
yesterday or the memories

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of the habits, like
learning how to ride a bike

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and drive a car, all the
skills of playing tennis--

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
these memories are not stored
inside the brain as material

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
memory traces, but depend
on resonance with ourselves

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And so individual memory
occurs, because we're

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
more like ourselves
than anyone else,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
so we get highly specific
morphic resonance.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Collective memory is
we're like other people,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
but not as similar
as to ourselves.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So we get a background
of collective memory

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
as well as the more sharply
focused individual memory.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And from this point of
view, these are different

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
in degree but not in kind.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
They're two aspects of
the same phenomenon.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The usual view about the
mind is that the mind

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
is confined to the head.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:10%
It's nothing but the
activity of the brain.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
For the materialists, who
represent the majority position

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
within academic
life and in science,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%
minds are what brains do.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
They're-- it's-- the physical
activity of the brain is all

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:90%
there is to it.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And memories are stored
materially inside the brain.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all inside the brain.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that's an incredibly
truncated and narrow view.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I think
we access our memories

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:90%
by morphic resonance.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not inside the brain.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I think that
our consciousness, our minds

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
are not confined to
the inside of our heads

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
but stretch out beyond
them through fields.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
We're always-- we're all used
to the idea of magnetic fields

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
being inside magnets
and stretching

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
beyond them or the gravitational
fields of the Earth

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
being inside the Earth
and stretching out

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
into space invisibly, all
the fields of cell phones

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:84%
being inside the cell phone and
stretching invisibly around it,

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:90%
which is why they work.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But so far, people have
taken them deliberately

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and restricted the
material view of the mind.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It must be the brain,
only there in the brain.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's such a
narrow view of matter.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean, physics has moved on.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.868 align:middle line:10%
All matter now has fields
associated with it,

00:13:14.868 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, the brain does.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:10%
It has electromagnetic
fields you can measure

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:10%
with an electroencephalograph.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:10%
But I think that the
fields of the mind

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:10%
are much more extensive.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:10%
I think that they're involved
in every act of perception.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:10%
When I look at something or when
someone looks at me, the image,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:10%
I think, is not inside the
brain but where it seems to be.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think vision involves
light, for example,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
reflected off me, going
through into a camera

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
or into someone's eye,
where it forms an image.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then in our eyes, they're
inverted images in both eyes.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Then there are impulses
up the optic nerve

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and changes in the brain.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
The usual assumption
is this then results

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:84%
in a three-dimensional full
color artificial virtual

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
reality display
inside our heads,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.857 align:middle line:90%
which is what we experience.

00:14:10.857 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think
there's any reason

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:90%
to suppose it's inside the head.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:10%
No one's ever seen
a virtual reality

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:10%
display inside someone's head,
even during brain surgery.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.705 align:middle line:84%
I think that these
images we create

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
are projected out to
where they seem to be.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So when I look at a tree--

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:90%
there are plenty around here--

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
when I look at a tree, my image
of the tree is projected out

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and coincides with where
the tree actually is.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
If I look at a person,
my image of them

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is projected to where
they actually are.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
My mind, in some sense,
touches what I'm looking at.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why the
sense of being stared at exists,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:84%
why people can feel when they're
being looked at from behind,

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and why animals can feel
when they're being looked at.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think the mind's extended
in every act of perception,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
not confined to the brain.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And these extended
fields of the mind

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
are a kind of morphic
field, and the memory

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
involved in recognizing things
is a kind of morphic resonance.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a field
theory of the mind

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and says our minds
are extended in space.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:84%
They're extended
through intentions

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
as well, like if I
had the intention

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to ring up somebody
on the telephone,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
my intention to
talk to that person

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
goes ahead of the phone call,
and I then get the phone

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:90%
and dial it and speak to them.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But if my intention
reaches out to that person,

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
even if they're hundreds
or thousands of miles away,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
they might start thinking of me,
and then when I ring, they say,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:90%
that's funny.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I just started
thinking about you,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:90%
and here you are on the phone.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that's because they're
picking up my intention.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very, very
common phenomenon, probably

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
the most common
telepathic phenomenon

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world
happening in connection

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:90%
with telephone calls.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that's another
manifestation of the extended

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I think animals have
extended minds, too,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
through visual perception
and through intention.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
specifically human.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what this means is a lot
of so-called psychic phenomena

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
or parapsychological
phenomena are not paranormal,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
which is what they're
usually called,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:90%
which means beyond the normal.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:90%
They're completely normal.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:84%
The sense of being stared at,
the thinking of someone who

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
then calls on the phone,
dogs and cats picking up

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
when their owners are
coming home telepathically--

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
all these things are
normal everyday occurrences

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
in millions of people's lives.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
They're not paranormal.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:90%
They're normal.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
They're not supernatural.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They're natural.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I just think they're part
of animal and human nature.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So the extended mind is not
something specifically human.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Animals have
extended minds, too.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just the way
minds work through fields.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think many spiritual practices
have a scientific basis

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and can be investigated
scientifically,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's the theme of my
book, "Science and Spiritual

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Practices."

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
kinds of ritual.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
I think rituals in general,
by being done in a similar way

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
to the way they've
been done before,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
tap in by morphic resonance to
those who've done them before,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
so there's a kind of influence,
a presence of the past.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And one specific kind
of ritual or rites

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of passage, which
transitions from one

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
stage of life to another--

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
the first and most
fundamental is birth itself.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Then there are rites of
passage to do from adolescence

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
to sexual maturity, from
being a single person to being

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
a married person, as there
were various initiation

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:90%
rites of passage.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Most professions and
academic institutions

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
have like a graduation ceremony
as a kind of rite of passage.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And death is, of course,
a rite of passage.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:90%
A funeral is a rite of passage.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
A person moves from one
role, being a living person,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:11.975 align:middle line:90%
They become an ancestor.

00:18:11.975 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So one of the themes
of rites of passage

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
is near-death experiences.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
You die to one role, and
you're born again in a new way.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And I think science
has enabled us

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:10%
to know a lot more than we used
to about near-death experiences

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:10%
by studying them.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:10%
Near-death
experiences, of course,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:10%
happen when people nearly die,
and lots more people nearly

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:10%
die than used to.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:10%
And this has become an
increasingly common phenomenon,

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:10%
owing to the fact
that modern medicine

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:10%
and coronary
resuscitation have meant

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people who would have
died in the past don't die now.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.665 align:middle line:90%
Their lives are saved.

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:10%
And people who've had
these experiences often

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:10%
report floating
out of their body,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:10%
going through a kind
of tube or tunnel,

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:10%
a bit like Stan Grof's birth
canal perinatal archetype,

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:10%
entering a zone of
light, peace, and joy.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they come back, because
it's a near-death experience.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And people who've had
these experiences often

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
say they've lost
the fear of death.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Their life has been
completely transformed.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
They've died, and
they've been born again.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
many rites of passage

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%
include such experiences.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- my
own interpretation

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
of the rite of baptism as
described in the New Testament

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:90%
is just such an experience.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist was there on
the banks of the River Jordan.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
People flocked to him from
all over the Holy Land.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
He baptized them
by immersing them,

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
total immersion in the River
Jordan, held them under,

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:84%
brought them up again, and
it transformed their lives.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:90%
It did the same for Jesus.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was initiated by John the
Baptist into this experience,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was the
first step described

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible of his
awareness of his--

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
when God says, "This
is my beloved son

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in whom I am well
pleased," this sense

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
of connection with
the divine that

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:90%
underlay his entire ministry.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So near-death experiences,
through rites of passage,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
can be transformative,
just as they are

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:90%
when they occur accidentally.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And my own view is
that John the Baptist

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:84%
was inducing a near-death
experience through drowning.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It's usually interpreted as a
symbolic near-death experience

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.900 align:middle line:84%
by drowning, but it'd only
take a couple of minutes

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:90%
longer to have the real thing.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And then people who underwent
this experience would

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
say that they'd died
and been born again,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and they'd seen the light,
and their lives were changed.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And when Anabaptists revived
this practice of baptism

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:84%
by total immersion
in the 16th century

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
as part of the ferment of
the Protestant revolution,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I think they rediscovered
this principle.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And the church is derived
from the Anabaptists,

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
like the Mennonites
and the Baptists.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They still retain this
form of initiation

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.025 align:middle line:84%
through total immersion, death
and rebirth through drowning.

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I suppose that most
modern Baptists are

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
very aware of
liability litigation,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and probably ministers are
very careful not to do it

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
for too long and
may not actually

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
induce very often full blown
near-death experiences.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But I suspect that John the
Baptist and the Anabaptists

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:90%
in the past did do just that.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's not a
coincidence that the Baptist

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
churches are the ones that talk
so much about the conversion

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
experience, where people
undergo a complete change

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
in their world view
almost instantly.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And they say they've
died, and they've

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
been born again into the light.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And if what they're
having is this kind

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.890 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experience,
that would be literally true.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they're often ridiculed,
especially by intellectuals

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and academics and so on.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they make
fun of Baptists.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And Baptists make fun of them
by questioning evolution.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
They know that it drives
professors in universities

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%
crazy to do that.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
enjoy teasing people.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
their basic worldview

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
about this
transformative experience

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is shaped by real near-death
experiences, at least

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:90%
historically.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are many other
forms of rite of passage,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and I think for
many people today,

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic drugs
play a similar role.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of them induce
near-death type experiences,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
points that Stan Grof made

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.040 align:middle line:90%
as a result of his LSD research.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:10%
I think if there are
no rites of passage,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:10%
people don't really transition
properly from one stage of life

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:10%
to another.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can't
help being born.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are always rites of
passage associated with birth,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
like purification ceremonies
or thanksgiving ceremonies

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:90%
or naming ceremonies.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Baptism, a christening, is
a traditional Christian one.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus was born,
his parents took him

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to the temple, the presentation
of Christ in the temple.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a feast celebrated in the
Catholic and Anglican churches.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.835 align:middle line:84%
This was a rite of passage
for baby and for mother

00:23:57.835 --> 00:23:58.635 align:middle line:90%
after a birth.

00:23:58.635 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think without
that rite of passage,

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely women
would suffer from postnatal

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
depression and that
children wouldn't--

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
are less likely to be
properly recognized

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:84%
by the whole extended family,
because a christening means

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
everyone comes together
to recognize and see

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:90%
that child named.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't happen,
then news filters out,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:84%
but there's no kind of
change in consciousness

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
associated with it.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no rite of
passage at adolescence,

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:84%
then people
desperately need them,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.980 align:middle line:84%
so they invent very
unsuitable ones.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Gangs have rites of
passage, which often involve

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:84%
acts of violence or
committing crimes,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's transformed the
idea of a trial by ordeal.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And if people don't have the
rite of passage of marriage,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
but just live together,
then what they're doing

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
is entering into a perfectly
private arrangement,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas marriage is a
public arrangement, where

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
by inviting people
to the wedding,

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you have a cloud
of witnesses, who

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:90%
all feel part of that marriage.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It's more than something
just about two people.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a social institution.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
come to the wedding,

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
generally speaking,
especially if it's fun

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and there's a nice
feast, feel very

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
benignly towards the people
who've gotten married,

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and there's a kind of
blessing that they will give

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and ongoing support from
this wider community,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
whereas if it's a purely
private arrangement-- just

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
move in with someone
and live together-- then

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
that dimension isn't there.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a loss, I
think, not a gain.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people think it
makes them more free,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but I think it
actually removes some

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of the benefits of the so--

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
it's hard enough being married.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we need all the
blessings we can get.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think rites
of passage for death

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
are very important, too,
because it enables those

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
who are grieving to recognize
this as a kind of passage,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
a transition, and it gives
a way of recognizing that

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and assimilating the fact
of that person's passing

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and transitioning to a
different realm of being

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
or non-being, if
you're an atheist.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But at least it's a
transition either way.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, having other
people present as witnesses

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:90%
and as support makes--

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
this is not just a
personal individual event.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a social event.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And it affects very much
those who know a person well.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I think good funeral
services are really important.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And people who say, oh,
I don't want a funeral.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, just scatter the
ashes and stuff, I think it's--

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
they may not want to
be made a fuss of,

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and it may be done
out of modesty or out

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of a defiance of convention.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But for the people
left behind, I

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:84%
think that these ceremonies
are really important.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And all religions
traditionally provide them,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:84%
whereas people who lose contact
with their traditional religion

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
or any pick and mix bits
from other religions

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
often don't have this regular
framework of rites of passage.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You can, of course, construct
your own and invent them all,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
but that's much harder
than just fitting

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:90%
into a standard pattern.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you've lost
someone, and they've died,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.925 align:middle line:90%
you're grieving.

00:27:22.925 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:90%
There's an awful lot to do.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to have to
invent a whole new ceremony.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to have a
ready made one and people,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
professionals, who
know how to conduct it.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm all in favor of
sticking with traditional rites

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.200 align:middle line:90%
of passage.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:90%
