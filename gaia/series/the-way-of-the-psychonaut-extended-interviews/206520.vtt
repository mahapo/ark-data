00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I met Stan Grof
in early 1977.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
At that time I had published
my first book, "The Tao

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:90%
of Physics" two years earlier.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:90%
It had been a big success.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I got a lot of
invitations to lectures,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to professional associations and
organizations from all fields

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and had discussions with
people from many disciplines

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and people from
every walk of life.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly there
were many psychologists

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and psychotherapists
among these people.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
the kind of paradigm

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
shift that I described
in "The Tao of Physics,"

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
a shift from a mechanistic
worldview to a holistic view

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
was happening also
in their field.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
At that time you had
humanistic psychology

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and its various tributaries.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And so in those
discussions, the name

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Stan Grof was often mentioned.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very curious
about Stan and was

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
delighted when I got an
invitation to a small gathering

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:84%
in the private
home of about maybe

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
10, 15 people where Stan would
present a summary of his work.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And when I met Stan I was very
surprised because I had always

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
heard people refer
to him as Stan Grof.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't associate
anything with him.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw
him and heard him,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I immediately knew
that he was Czech.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned that
his full name is Stanislav.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And to me this was
a big experience

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
because I was born in Vienna,
and Stan was born in Prague.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The two cities are just
about 100 kilometers apart.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, the Czech culture
and the Viennese culture

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:90%
are very closely intermingled.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
There are many Czechs in Vienna.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the two countries
have influenced

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
one another very much.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So meeting Stan was sort of
like meeting a distant cousin,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I realized he was
European, which I didn't know.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But in the first two seconds
I knew he was European.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that he was Czech.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was very familiar
to me in some sense.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So there was a kind of
intimacy right from the start.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And this intimacy was enhanced
by Stan's very warm and open

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
personality which everybody
who knows him knows.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And so from that evening on,
our relationship very quickly

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
developed into a
close friendship.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course I was very
excited about his work,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and he about mine.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
intellectual connection.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But there was also a very
strong emotional and cultural

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
connection because we came
from the same part of Europe.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so in the following
months in 1977

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I visited Stan several times
at Esalen, where he lived,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:90%
had many discussions with him.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we planned
the seminars together,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
which we call "Journeys
Beyond Space and Time."

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And those were an inner
journey and an outer journey,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
the inner journey of
transpersonal experiences,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
mystical experiences,
psychedelic experiences,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and the outer
journey of physicists

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
delving into matter at the
atomic and subatomic level.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And those were a series
of very exciting seminars.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I presented the worldview,
the perception of reality

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that emerged in atomic
and subatomic physics

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
where the solid objects
of our everyday experience

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
dissolve into energy patterns
and where particles can travel

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
backward and forward in
time, where these energy

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
patterns furthermore are
intrinsically dynamic,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the whole universe being
a cosmic dance of energy.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And so Stan was describing
very similar experiences

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
when he talked about psychedelic
and transpersonal experiences.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I did, he
was comparing them

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to the experience of mystics.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And so now we had
three perspectives,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the mystical experience, the
transpersonal experience,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and the experience
of physicists,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
in those subatomic experiments.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I usually would
start the seminar.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
Stan got to speak,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
people had heard about all
these strange appearances which

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
were part of theories
by Nobel laureates

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and the most respected
of the sciences.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So I brought a lot of
prestige to these seminars,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
not that Stan didn't
have prestige.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But still hearing it from
two sides, psychology,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
transpersonal psychology
and subatomic physics,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
reinforced the
concepts considerably.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so people were much
more open to his ideas

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:90%
after hearing me.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And can I ask, what in
particular about that research

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:10%
into the subatomic dimension
around is important to know?

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what is important
to know is really that

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
at the subatomic level there
are no separate objects,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that a subatomic particle,
an electron or a proton,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
for a physicist is not an object
but is a set of relationships

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that reach outward
to other things.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when you ask, what
are these other things,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
they are again sets
of relationships.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And you never end up
with any "things" at all.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You always end up
with relationships.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a world of patterns,
of relationships, of processes.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is now part of
a very general paradigm

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
shift in the sciences
and in society at large,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that we are no longer
seeing the world

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
as a machine made of some
kind of basic building blocks.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
We are beginning to
understand it as a network

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:90%
or as networks within networks.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that key insight that
in science appeared first

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
in physics has now appeared
in biology and medicine

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
and in economics and
various other sciences.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.515 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think,
the very essence.

00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.015 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would
be systems theory?

00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's systems theory.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call the
systems view of life.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
conception of life.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So after writing "The Tao of
Physics" and my second book,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
"The Turning Point," where I
applied this to other areas,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
in particular biology, medicine,
psychology, and economics,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
after that I spent the next
30 years integrating what

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I call the systems view of life,
a new conception of life that

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
has now emerged in science.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And Stan was one
of the very first

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the
most important one

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to give this new
conception of life

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and this new
perception of reality

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
an emotional content and
experiential content.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.185 align:middle line:84%
I think this is one of his
many great contributions.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Experiential in the sense
that when people have these

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:10%
deep experiences, they get
the picture of relationships?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's not an
intellectual exercise.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
When I say that a subatomic
particle is essentially

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
a set of relationships,
you can try

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to wrap your mind around
it intellectually.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
But you can also experience it.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And Stan helps people
to experience it.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And he analyzes
experiences of mystics,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of psychotics,
psychotic experiences,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic experiences.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.146 align:middle line:90%
And he ties it all together.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it's pretty powerful.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:10%
>> And so I ask here, how did
your interactions with Stan

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:10%
influence your thinking or
understanding of what you had

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:10%
been working on?

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Stan's influence
on my work in the late 1960s

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and early 1980s was enormous,
absolutely enormous.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
At that time I had
decided to write

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
a second book about
the paradigm shift

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
from the mechanistic to
the holistic worldview

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
in various fields,
starting from physics

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
but then moving on to
biology, psychology, medicine,

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and economics.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And in these fields
I had no expertise.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
start reading books

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:84%
because I wouldn't
know where to start.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided very early
on to work with people.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I developed a
skill and a talent

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to recognize people in
meetings and conferences,

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
people who were
experts in their fields

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and who shared my vision
of this paradigm shift.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And Stan was one of them.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And on the first evening
actually when I met him,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
when he presented the
summary of his work,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
he presented this cartography
of the unconscious

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%
that he developed.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And this cartography allowed
him to integrate various schools

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of psychology and psychotherapy,
psychoanalysis, and so on

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
which were often
contradictory but which

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
he said were addressing
different levels

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:90%
of the unconscious.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:10%
And so not only did he know
a lot about psychology,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:10%
he also had a framework to
integrate these various schools

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:10%
of psychology.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course for me this
was tremendously helpful.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
My basic premise for this
book, "The Turning Point,"

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
was that the various sciences
in the 18th and 19th centuries

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
had modeled themselves
after Newtonian physics,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
had adopted a
mechanistic outlook.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And now it was time to change.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And now there was this
paradigm shift happening

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:90%
in the other sciences.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And so in psychology
it's quite easy to see

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
how behaviorism, one of the
main schools of 20th century

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
psychology, how behaviorism
had this mechanistic outlook,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
because instead of
studying consciousness,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
those psychologists sort
of eliminated consciousness

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and concentrated
purely on behavior

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and analyzed behavior in
very mechanistic terms,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:90%
in terms of reflexes and so on.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
fairly easy to see.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But to see how Freud
modeled his psychoanalysis

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
after Newtonian physics
is much more subtle.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what helped
Stan helped me to do,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:90%
what Stan showed me.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of tutored
me in psychoanalysis

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and Freud's theory and showed
how in very subtle ways,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
this is also modeled
after Newtonian physics.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore the whole
notion of mental illness

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that Stan developed was very
influential on my thinking

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and has been so since
the present day actually.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Stan saw two types of
human experiences--

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
our everyday
experience, which you

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
can call a Cartesian
experience, where

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
we have our environment
consisting of separate objects.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Time flows in a linear way.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
There are cause-and-effect
relationships and so on.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
transpersonal experiences

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
where there are no separate
objects, where there

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
are webs of relationships,
energy patterns,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:19.180 align:middle line:84%
flows, everything is
moving, vibrating, dancing,

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
no strict cause-and-effect
relationships.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have these two
types of experiences.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And according to Stan, mental
illness occurs when people

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
cannot integrate those
two experiences properly.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So the way to recognize
mental illness

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is not by the contents
of the experience

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
but rather by the inability
to integrate experiences.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this is very
revolutionary and very

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
important for
therapy because still

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
today in most of
psychiatry when people

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:84%
have psychotic experiences,
these experiences

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:90%
are suppressed with drugs.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
What Stan says is,
on the contrary,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
you should not suppress them.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You should allow them to
emerge and come to a conclusion

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and integration.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So Stan saw psychotic symptoms,
or symptoms of mental illness,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
as frozen experiences.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And these frozen experiences
need to be unfrozen.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And he would do this with
LSD initially and then

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
with these other
techniques and be

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:90%
allowed to come to conclusion.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me this was very
exciting because when

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I met Stan Grof,
around the same time

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I also met RD Laing, the
Scottish psychiatrist who

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
did very revolutionary work in
the treatment of mental illness

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and who had exactly
the same view as Stan--

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
expressed it
slightly differently,

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
but it was exactly
the same thing.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And he had a very
activist approach,

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
protesting against the habits
of psychiatric hospitals

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of constraining patients
against their will and so on,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
not recognizing them as
authentic human beings

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But the basic model of mental
illness of Laing and Grof

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:90%
is very similar.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So for me this was a
very exciting time,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
the late '70s, early '80s.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, after Stan and
I became friends,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
he often invited me to
a very special seminar

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that he and his wife,
Christina, organized at Esalen.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a month-long seminar.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And at Esalen it was simply
known as the "Grof Month-Long."

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And during one month,
they had a small group

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
of people, of maybe 20 people,
living together at Esalen

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:90%
for a whole month.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And he would invite a string of
guest lecturers moving through,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
each one staying two or three
days, presenting something

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
quite extraordinary,
some radically new ideas,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:90%
some really significant work.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And they would combine this with
experiential work, with what

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
everybody at the time just
called Grof breathing,

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:90%
the Holotropic breathing.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they had sessions
of Holotropic breathing.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They had sessions of
meditation, of art and crafts.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They lived together
almost like a tribe.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was mainly
Christina Grof

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
who built this
learning community

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
like a tribe with a lot of
aesthetics in an absolutely

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, sensuous environment
with sensuous experiences,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
the Esalen hot baths, the
meditation, the breathing

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
exercises, plus
intellectual stimulation.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So this was really an
extraordinary time.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I participated in many
of these month-long seminars.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And for me this was a time of
both personal and intellectual

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:90%
expansion and growth.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have many
memories from that period.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think one that
I'd like to mention

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is that in 1978, in
the summer of '78,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Stan and Christina went
on a long lecture tour.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
where they went.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But they were away
for several weeks.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And they let me
stay in their house.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So I stayed at this
Grof house just north

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Esalen Institute.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was a small
wooden cottage

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
with a room with big glass
windows on two sides right

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
above the Pacific
Ocean with a big deck

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
outside right above the waves,
where the waves hit the rocks.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you would hear the
sound of the waves, the rhythm

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean day and night.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed there
for several weeks

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
working on my manuscript, the
manuscript of "The Turning

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Point."

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that I would
go to Esalen for dinner

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:84%
but would spend the time
alone working during the day.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I would get
up in the morning.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And it was often foggy and cold.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So I would put on a
sweater or a sweatshirt

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and would start work always
with the windows and doors

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
open, the breeze coming
in from the ocean.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And as the sun rose, I
would move my small table

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the shade.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, the
temperature would rise.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:90%
It would get warmer and warmer.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I would undress layer by layer.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, I would
be in a t-shirt sweating

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:90%
in the hot sun.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And then in the afternoon, it
was the opposite, you know?

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
When the sun went down,
it got cooler and cooler.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I would end up
in my sweater again.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And to make it even more
meditative, I built a sundial.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't use a watch.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I had my sundial to
see what time it was.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really meditative
experience, full of work

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
but very meditative
in the rhythms

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:90%
of nature at the same time.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:84%
At the time in the
1970s, in the late '70s

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
when I was working on
"The Turning Point,"

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I tried to describe the paradigm
shift in the life sciences--

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
biology, medicine,
psychology, economics,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:90%
the life and social sciences.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
physics was not

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the right model for
describing these other fields.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The conceptual
framework of physics

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
was not sufficient because
physics doesn't deal with life.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Physics deals with
non-living phenomena.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed a
different framework.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered systems
theory, cybernetics,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and started putting
together a synthesis

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:84%
of what I called already then
the systems view of life.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And over the last 30 years,
I've been working on that.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "The
Turning Point,"

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
this framework was visible
to me only in its outlines.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
But since then, I wrote
several other books

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
where I completed the
synthesis more and more.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And finally in 2014, I published
a textbook called actually

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
"The Systems View
of Life," published

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
by Cambridge
University Press, where

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I present the full synthesis.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say in
relationship to Stan's work,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
the major novelty
in science has been

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:84%
complexity theory and chaos
theory and cognitive science,

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:90%
which didn't exist at the time.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a theory called the
Santiago theory of cognition

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
which sees mind as a process,
the process of commission,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and identifies it very closely
with the very process of life.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So mind and life are very
intimately connected.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship
between mind and matter

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:84%
is one between
process and structure.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a very novel idea which
didn't exist in the 1970s.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I think this is the major
change, the major progress.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't negate
anything of what

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
we discussed in the '70s.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
Stan's work has

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
added the emotional and
experiential dimension

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
to these ideas is
still fully valid.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:84%
In complexity theory,
one major discovery,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and to me the most
important discovery,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:84%
is a process that is
usually known as emergence.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is that
when you have a living organism,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:84%
as we all know,
living organisms are

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
able to maintain themselves
in a state of balance

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:90%
during their lifespan.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is known
technically as homeostasis.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But every now and then
such a living system

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:90%
will encounter an imbalance.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this imbalance
will become so strong

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
because of feedback loops
and various processes,

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
internal processes, that
there is a state of crisis,

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
a state of
instability or crisis.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the
system may either break down.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Or what occurs much
more frequently,

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it may break through to
a new state of order,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:90%
with a new state of balance.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So this process of the
emergence of novelty

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
at critical points
of instability

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, the most important
discovery of complexity theory.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
the process that Stan

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
described when he says that
the symptoms of mental illness

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:90%
are frozen.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you unfreeze them,
then they break through.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And a new state of
being, a new experience

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the completion
of these transpersonal

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the life
sciences have now

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
given a theoretical model
including a mathematical model

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to this notion.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same notion around
the same time in the 1960s

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and 1970s was
developed by RD Laing,

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
who said that madness
need not be a breakdown.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It can also be a breakthrough.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So this has now found
a scientific framework

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
within biology and
the life sciences.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
To me that's maybe the
most important change

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:90%
since those days.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it fully
vindicates Stan's work.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:10%
>> And it kind of speaks
to where we're presently

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:10%
at as a species on this
planet, doesn't it?

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely yes because
we are definitely in a state

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:10%
of crisis.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We have a multifaceted
global crisis.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you study
our global crisis,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the most striking
characteristic is

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that the major problems of our
time are all interconnected.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You cannot solve energy alone
or economics alone or health

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
or violence and war, economic
inequality, climate change.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
All these problems
are interconnected and

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:90%
interdependent.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately they come back
to a crisis of perception,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:10%
applying an outdated worldview
to the current globally

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:10%
interconnected world.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:10%
>> That's fabulous, by the way.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.920 align:middle line:10%
So next question,
what are your thoughts

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:10%
regarding what it
will take for humanity

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:10%
to survive the current dilemma
that it's created for itself?

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we need two changes.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:84%
One is this very profound
shift of perception from--

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and which is also a
shift of metaphors,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:84%
seeing the world as a machine to
understanding it as a network.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
medicine, for instance,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
conventional medicine sees
the human body as a machine,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:90%
separates it from the mind.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:84%
When you go to a
hospital, they would

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
try and influence the
mechanisms of the body

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:84%
by giving you drugs
or applying surgery.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Nobody cares what
you eat, for example.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Hospital food is very well
known to be usually very bad.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize that
it's all one process.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The mind is separated
and so on and so forth.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
The same way with the management
of human organizations.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
re-engineering organizations,

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.090 align:middle line:84%
about fine tuning the economy
as if it were a machine.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And it just goes on and on.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So the shift from the machine to
the network is very important.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But equally important, I
think, is the shift of values,

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:84%
that we need to shift
from, let's say,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
egocentric values to
ecocentric values.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that impressed me

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
from the very early days
in my discussions with Stan

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
was that he reported
when people go

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:84%
through these
transpersonal experiences

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and these experiential
therapies,

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
they come out with
different sets of values.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly material
possessions seem

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
less important and
human relationships

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:90%
become more important.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
the shift we need.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So this new conception
of life that

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
has emerged in the last
30 years or so in science

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a
shift of perception

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
from seeing the world as a
machine to understanding it

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:90%
as a network.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We have discovered that
the material world is not

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
made of some basic
building blocks

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:54.050 align:middle line:84%
but is an inseparable
network of relationships.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
We have also discovered
that the planet as a whole

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is a living,
self-regulating system.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the famous Gaia theory.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Correspondingly, the
human body is no longer

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:90%
seen as the machine.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is no longer
seen as a separate entity.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But rather, we have come to
realize that every living

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:84%
organism, every part
of a living organism,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
every tissue in our body,
every bodily organ, in fact,

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
every single cell is a living
and a cognitive system--

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
so life and cognition
always closely interrelated.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is no longer seen
as a competitive struggle

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
for existence but rather as
some kind of cooperative dance

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:84%
in which creativity and
the emergence of novelty

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:90%
are the driving forces.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And with the increased
emphasis on relationships,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
patterns of organization,
complexity, and so on,

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
a whole new science of qualities
is now slowly emerging.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So this just is, in
a nutshell, what I

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:90%
call the systems view of life.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the
systems view of life

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
because it requires a
new kind of thinking

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to be understood,
which is thinking

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
in terms of relationships,
in terms of patterns,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in terms of context.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And in science, this is
known as systems thinking

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:90%
or systemic thinking.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I've been
working on over the last 30

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.010 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should maybe add that
one thing we didn't talk about

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
was that spirituality
is always very

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.780 align:middle line:84%
much at the center
of Stan's work.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he doesn't address
it directly all the time,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:90%
often he does but not always.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's always there in
the background as a core

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
because this transpersonal
experience ultimately

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual experience.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he always
makes these links

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.470 align:middle line:90%
to various spiritual traditions.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And I should also mention
that one of the things

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that Stan has done for
me was to invite me

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to a major conference in
India, in Bombay in 1980.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was about modern
science and Eastern mysticism.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And there were lots and
lots of speakers there.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was my
first trip to India

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and a big experience for me.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
thing I owe to Stan.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:90%
