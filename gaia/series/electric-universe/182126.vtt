>> Carl Sagan, once wrote,
"We are a way for the universe

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.300 align:middle line:90%
to know itself."

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Some part of our being knows
this is where we came from.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:84%
We long to return, and we
can, because the cosmos

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
is also within us.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%
We're made of star stuff."

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:90%
But what is this star stuff?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The traditional model of
how a star is formed states,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
stars form inside relatively
dense concentrations

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of interstellar gas and dust.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
When the density reaches a
certain point, stars form.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
As romantic as that may
sound, and possibly correct,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
electric universe
offers a new theory

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
on how stars are born that might
shape the way we think they

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
behave and a new solution to
the arrangement of planets

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.165 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

>> On July 1, 2004, the
Cassini probe entered

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's atmosphere, and for
13 years it studied the planet.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Its mission ended in 2017 when
it was running out of fuel.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The mission team steered Cassini
closer to the surface of Saturn

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
than ever before and captured
some amazing new data

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:90%
before it burned up.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
They named this
"The Grand Finale."

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And on October 5, 2018,
six teams of researchers

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:10%
published their work
based on the findings

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:10%
from Cassini's Grand Finale.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered was
electric currents connecting

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Saturn and the D ring.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:10%
>> When the Cassini mission
was heading for Saturn,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.813 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a website article
called Cassini's homecoming.

00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
then I was saying,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
here we are, we're examining a
home star for the first time,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and I expect there would be
many surprises, which of course,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be correct.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
The very last one was when
the Cassini spacecraft

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
was directed to orbit
very close to Saturn

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
on the final few orbits and
go inside the inner ring.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
They found that the electron
density in that ring plane

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
was far higher than it is
anywhere north or south of it.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:10%
This means that
part of Saturn still

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:10%
has the classic electrical
circuitry, which

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:10%
Hannes Alfven published, as
any star or any magnetized body

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:10%
inside the solar system.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:10%
The other interesting thing
is that the magnetic field

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:10%
of Saturn is perfectly aligned
with this rotation axis, which

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:10%
means that the
standard story of how

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:10%
the magnetism of a celestial
body is created doesn't work,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:10%
because it always relies
on the magnetic pole being

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.826 align:middle line:10%
offset from the rotation pole
to maintain the magnetic field.

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, how then
could the electric universe

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
theory explain Saturn
as our home star?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:90%
How would that be possible?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Wall Thornhill suggests
we first examine

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
a new theory on how a star
is born and how it operates.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of the formation
of the solar system from

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the electric universe point
of view is quite different

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to the standard approach,
where matter just forms clumps

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
of material by gravity, which
finally collapses further

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to form stars, and then the
planets are just the leftovers

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:90%
after the star is formed.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
None of this has
been shown to work.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
model is based on the idea

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that, at the galactic
scale, electromagnetism

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is the dominant energy
source and the power

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:90%
behind the formation of stars.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It is a far more effective
force at gathering

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
material over a large
distance and also

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:90%
concentrating it powerfully.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It can be seen even in the
lightning bolts on Earth,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
it constricts the
atmosphere and heats it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
along the thin
lightning channel.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of thing
happens in molecular clouds

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
inside our galaxy,
and it has been

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
shown by infrared telescopes
in space, like the Herschel

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
telescope, which
has discovered stars

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
forming like pearls
on a necklace

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
inside these molecular clouds.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now the electric universe says
it's not all that complicated.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.300 align:middle line:84%
If it form stars, it can form
bodies of all different sizes

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It's been found that there are
numerous brown dwarfs formed

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
at the same time and also
planetary-sized objects

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
floating freely, which
is a bit of a puzzle

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
because planets are
supposed to form

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
after the stars are
formed from the material

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:90%
left over by the star.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But if they're free floating,
how did they get there?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a puzzle.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not at all a puzzle
if all of these bodies

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
are formed at the same time
along that lightning channel.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And those bodies can
be of different sizes.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The larger ones become
stars because they

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
form a focus for
electrical activity, which

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:90%
dominates their vicinity.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If planets and stars
formed on a lightning channel,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.191 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a feature of the way
electricity travels through

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
space, that it forms two
filaments twisted around one

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
another in a helix, so that when
they enter a cloud of material,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the result of that is to cause
the two filaments to pinch

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:90%
closer together.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:90%
The current density rises.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
They glow, and this is
where we see these lightning

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:90%
bolts in those clouds.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is a signature
of electrical formation,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:90%
not gravitational.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
These cosmic filaments
that I mentioned

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
are these twin filaments
rotating around one another,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're known
in plasma science

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:90%
as "Birkeland currents."

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:10%
They're named after
Kristian Birkeland, one

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:10%
of the pioneers of the
electric universe model, who

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:10%
is researching in 1900 at
the turn of the century

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:10%
and doing practical experiments.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:10%
And he produced what he called
a terella, a little earth

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:10%
inside a vacuum
chamber, connected it up

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:10%
to electrical power and
was able to demonstrate

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:10%
sunspot activity,
Saturn's rings, and also

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:10%
auroral behavior.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
His initial study was
on the magnetic effects

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of auroras, which showed,
to him, that space

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.805 align:middle line:90%
is full of charged particles.

00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until the space age

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%
that it was finally confirmed.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:10%
They were dubbed
"Birkeland currents."

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Once you understand that
these cosmic currents,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:10%
these filaments, will always
follow the magnetic field,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:10%
it allows you to trace the
directions of the currents

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:10%
in various parts of space.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they find is that the
magnetic field along the spiral

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.367 align:middle line:84%
arms traces along the arm
into the center of the galaxy.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's an electric
current flowing

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
along each of the spiral alarms
into the center of the galaxy.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:90%
And this is very important.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's also one of the
bases of hand cell phones

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
work on the functioning
of galaxies and stars.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Wall's theory suggests that
these currents flow between

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
upper and lower levels of the
galaxy and also side to side.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The galaxy is formed
where the pinch is.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And from that, filaments
are created and pushed

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
outwards in the
double-helix form.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
As the energy spreads out,
it hits more dense material,

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
thus beginning the formation
of stars along a seemingly

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Fibonacci shape.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The current that's
flowing along the spiral arms

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
of a galaxy is concentrated when
it meets more dense material,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
like a cloud of dust and gas,
called a "molecular cloud."

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, instead of
being diffuse and invisible,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
it pinches down, just
like lightning does.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There's currents flowing
in a lightning storm

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:90%
before you see any lightning.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Once the lightning
fades, these currents

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
are still flowing along
thin filaments, which

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
are invisible because the
current density is not

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:90%
high enough.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens to the
currents that are still

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
flowing?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And how can they be detected?

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer is that the power
which generated the lightning

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
bolt still exists, and they are
diffuse electric currents which

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%
are not in the visible spectrum.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
They can be detected
by radio telescopes

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
because they
generate radio noise.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So radio telescopes are one
of the most important type

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
of telescope to
confirm and to track

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.593 align:middle line:90%
these circuits in deep space.

00:09:00.593 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're already
beginning to do that

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
without actually admitting
that what they're finding

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:90%
is electric current.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
radio telescopes

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
do is they track the direction
of the magnetic fields in space

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
based on the polarization of
the radio signal they receive.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:10%
>> While Thornhill's theory
suggests that there are

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:10%
positive and negative charges in
the universe that create order,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:10%
the stars are formed on an anode
circuitry system that seeks

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.635 align:middle line:10%
a balance with other planets.

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> The anode is positive.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It just means that there's
a deficiency of electrons

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
in that body, and
this seems to be

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:90%
a feature of galaxies as well.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to replace
a deficit of electrons,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
they're connected

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:90%
to an even larger circuit.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.975 align:middle line:84%
All of this circuitry
extends between galaxies,

00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're
discovering this now.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
This was a puzzling finding.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.925 align:middle line:84%
The galaxies seem to be
strung like Catherine

00:09:54.925 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
works-- fireworks along even
more gigantic cosmic strings.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Within the galaxy,
along the galactic arms,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:84%
the current flows in towards
the center and along those arms.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
These stars look like street
lights along the power lines.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.672 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
The planets, on
the other hand, are

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
free to go wherever they
like after the lightning

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:90%
strike abates or moves on.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It's at that time that what
I call "electrogravity"

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:90%
takes over.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems faced by
standard cosmological thinking

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and the theory of Newton's
idea of gravity is that--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to capture
objects in space that are

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:90%
moving relative to one another.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.773 align:middle line:84%
They will just pass one another
and change their directions,

00:10:42.773 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
but they will not be
captured, because there's

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
no means of removing energy
from the object that's

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:90%
moving past you.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
needed for capture.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.657 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
catcher, somebody

00:10:51.657 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
who's going to restrict
the movement of this object

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:90%
past you.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.788 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
doesn't have this problem

00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:90%
because we have--

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:84%
as I've talked earlier
about electrical exchanges

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
between planets--

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it can also occur between
stars and planets.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is very effective
at capture, it turns out.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
says that, very simply,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
energy is a measure of
the motion of matter

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in relation to all the rest of
the measure in the universe.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there is
universal connectivity,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:84%
which is far different
from the model at present

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're presented of
the universe of isolation

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:90%
by huge distances and by time.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only connection is
by the puny force of gravity.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
connected in real time

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:90%
by the direct electric force.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:45.915 align:middle line:84%
It is not mediated by any
force at the speed of light,

00:11:45.915 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing that
travels at the speed of light

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is an electromagnetic
disturbance.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:10%
As for mass, in the
electric universe,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:10%
mass is the response of
matter to the electric force

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:10%
in the form of distortion
rather than acceleration.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I say this because, in
the electric universe model,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:84%
matter is a repeated pattern, so
that you have the atomic model,

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.732 align:middle line:90%
which is very successful.

00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got
one successful model,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.273 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to see
if you can repeat it

00:12:17.273 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:90%
at a different scale.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you do so and you say
the electron and the proton

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
have structure just like
little atomic systems,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
then if you give it
a poke electrically,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
its response will be to distort
because the charged particles

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
will tend to rearrange
themselves into the ones that

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
are orbiting into elliptical
orbits at right angles

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.637 align:middle line:90%
to the force.

00:12:44.637 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
the magnetic force.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic force is
always at right angles

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
to the electric force.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason,
because matter,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.826 align:middle line:84%
like electrons and protons,
have a real structure.

00:12:56.826 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out this kind of
electrical communication also

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
happens in biological
systems as well.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Inside our body, we
have electrically

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
charged particles that
create instant communication

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
with our body to
keep it running.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to
how a planet has

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
instant electrical
communication with the sun

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and how it is able to position
itself with it at all times

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
without getting
out of alignment.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
In this theory, there is
constant understanding

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of a universe that runs
on electrical charge,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
down to the smallest creature
on the planets themselves.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:10%
If this is true,
how can we explain

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:10%
different kinds of stars within
the same electrical circuit?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>> The stars that are being
formed by the cosmic lightning

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:10%
are then powered by these
diffuse, otherwise invisible,

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:10%
electric current filaments.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.107 align:middle line:84%
And it is that that determines
the environment of the star

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and how it will
function, whether it's

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:84%
a red star or a bright
white star, a blue giant

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:90%
or a red dwarf.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are
based on the size of the body

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and its electrical environment.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If the electrical
environment changes,

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
a star can change very
quickly from one type of star

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
observed but not

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
recognized as being a
function of the environment.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we come to the bright
stars, the main sequence stars,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the difference there is
that the energy density

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
is so high that
the plasma develops

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:90%
what's called "plasma tufts."

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
These tufts sit just off
the surface of the body,

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and they are what produces
all of the bright light.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:10%
It produces a spectrum, which
looks rather like a black body.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of this
particular model

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the
photosphere, the bright,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.360 align:middle line:84%
shining object we see in
the sky around the sun acts

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:90%
like a transistor.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It controls the power
flowing through that surface.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So if the sun's
environment changes,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the effect on those
bright stars is

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
minimized so that our own sun
maintains the same brightness

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
within a fraction of a percent,
even though, in x-rays, it's

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:90%
a variable star.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.985 align:middle line:84%
It almost goes out in x-rays,
and then at solar maximum,

00:15:10.985 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:90%
it's very bright in x-rays.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The standard story of the life
story of a star is invalid.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:84%
A star is not born and
then self-immolates,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
becomes a campfire in the
sky until all of its fuels

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
run out then blows up or
explodes as a supernova.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:90%
None of that story is correct.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The life story of a star is
like that of an individual,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.185 align:middle line:84%
and it depends very
much on its environment.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If the life story of a star
depends on its environment,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
how then does the
environment change the star?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And is there evidence
of this happening

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:90%
in our own solar system?

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference between a
red dwarf and a main-sequence

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
bright star like the sun
is based on the electrical

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The red dwarf is maybe
smaller and has difficulty

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
in collecting enough electrons
from the surrounding plasma

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to satisfy its discharge.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Now plasma is amazing because
it's charged material.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It tends to behave
like a living thing.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:90%
So what does it do?

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It's shell of charge, the
plasma sheath as it's known,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
expands until the surface
area is big enough

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to collect all of the electrons
required to satisfy the star's

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:90%
discharge.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:10%
In doing so, it creates
what's called a red anode glow

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:10%
because all stars
behave as an anode

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:10%
in the galactic discharge.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:10%
We can say that because all
of the features on a star

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:10%
can be explained very simply as
electrical effects on an anode.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of the features
of red stars-- and this

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
applies to red giants
as well as red dwarfs--

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.453 align:middle line:84%
there is no difference in
their actual functioning,

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and yet the standard
model would say there is.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
A red dwarf is a failed
star, practically.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.315 align:middle line:84%
It's not big enough
to burn properly.

00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:58.115 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:16:58.115 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
They're the same feature,
different size stars

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
that's all.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So if the electrical environment
of one of those stars changes,

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the sheath can expand
or can contract.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
Then the question
is, can we identify

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
the remnant of the brown
dwarf inside the solar system?

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, the ancients
did it for us very well.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They had no hesitation in
saying that what we regard now

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
as the planet Saturn
was the former sun.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the references to the
earlier sun, the same names

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
were transferred to the
present sun, Helios, Ra, Sol,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:84%
all referred
originally to Saturn.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:10%
As a brown dwarf, we've tended
to call that brown dwarf

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Proto-Saturn because
Proto-Saturn was changed

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:10%
on entry into the solar system
to become the ringed planet

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:10%
Saturn.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have universal
acceptance of the fact

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:90%
that Saturn was our home.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The question then is, well, how
did all of this appear to us?

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
As a brown dwarf drifting
through space on its own

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:84%
with his little entourage
of satellites planets

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
like the earth and Mars orbiting
about it, inside this red anode

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
glow, it would have
its own heliosphere.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The heliosphere of the sun
extends out to 100 times

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the distance of the
Earth from the sun.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a considerable
way up past Pluto.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
A brown dwarf star would have
a similarly bloated plasma

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
sheath at very large distances
from the star itself.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:84%
When these two
plasma sheaths meet

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is when the two objects,
the brown dwarf and the sun,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
see each other electrically
for the first time.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's then that
all hell breaks loose

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
on the minor partner,
the brown dwarf.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
And it will undergo flaring.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It will also
develop into a comet

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
because its voltage now has
shifted from being an anode,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.805 align:middle line:84%
to the galactic
discharge, to being

00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
a cathode inside
the solar system.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And all comets are
negative potential objects,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
which are called cathodes,
in a plasma discharge.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have very specific
consequences for the object.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The red plasma sheath
of Proto-Saturn,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
when it encountered the
sudden change in voltage

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
on approaching the sun, the
star itself, was it a voltage,

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
which was sufficiently
different.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
The light just went out.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
There would be a flickering
because the boundary

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
between the two stars
changes, goes in and out.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
These plasma spheres pulsate
with the power supply

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:90%
from the galaxy.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So it would have switched
on and off a few times

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and caused clearing.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But, eventually,
once it had really

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
entered the solar system,
about where the Voyager

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
spacecraft are
present, then there

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
would be no longer
any red anode glow.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It would convert from being
a star to a captured planet.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
But the captured process, as
I said, is a cometary process.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So it would have switched
from a star to a comet.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:10%
They eject material in an
attempt to lose charge,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:10%
which means that we
would have suddenly

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:10%
had our red envelope,
our red light go out,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:10%
so the purple light of the
earliest memories of mankind,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:10%
known as the "purple
dawn of creation"

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:10%
I think, in some ways,
would have dissipated.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
We would have seen the
stars for the first time.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
We would have seen our
central object star

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:90%
flare, become bright.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And this probably refers
to the "let there be light"

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
reference in the creation story.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> If Saturn was a brown dwarf
and possibly the original sun

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
for planet Earth, is there more
evidence in the ancient text

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.636 align:middle line:84%
and possibly the
planets themselves?

00:20:47.636 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the main questions
facing ancient researchers is,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:10%
why was Saturn called the sun?

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the early
Babylonian astronomical texts,

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
for example, Saturn will
be called "shamash,"

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
their name for the sun.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And, interestingly,
the same thing

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
shows up in the Greek
text, where Helios

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
is identified with Saturn.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in Egypt.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in Rome.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We are comparative
scholars, so we

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
base all of our
research and ideas

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
on traditions found
around the globe.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, thus far, Saturn
has not been identified

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
in the new world
texts or traditions,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
so so far we don't have a
Maya for Saturn, for example.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't have an Aztec
myth about Saturn.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where a
measure of uncertainty

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
still exists on exactly
what did they mean when

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:90%
they said Saturn was a sun?

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean from
an astronomical standpoint?

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The answers we
really still don't

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
know at a fundamental level.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But according to Dave
Talbot's research,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
he has reconstructed a situation
where the planet Saturn

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
dominated the sky
in prehistoric times

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and appeared as a
sun-like object.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.272 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.272 --> 00:22:15.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Now having that aside, we
then have the problem, well,

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
how do we form these
planetary systems?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, electrogravity
capture tells that story.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that is that
you have these weird assortment

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
of so-called
exoplanetary systems

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
which don't feature anything
like the solar system.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The solar system, with its
widely scattered gas giants,

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
is a feature of a captured
system, a blended family,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:10%
All of those
gas-giant-sized objects,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:10%
if they were beyond
the sun's influence,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.305 align:middle line:10%
would turn into red dwarfs.

00:22:44.305 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have
to do anything other

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
than escape the sun's influence
to turn into red dwarf stars.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And this tells you
that the possibility

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of the capture of a red dwarf
is much higher than anyone

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:90%
expects from standard thinking.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Cassini mission
have been an exploration

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:90%
of our home star?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And our stars created
on an electrical circuit

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that feeds off of each other
and the neighboring planets?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
This would mean that not only
does the universe run off

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of electricity, but it has an
infinite connection to a power

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:90%
source that connects all.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And if we are part of this
power source, where can

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:84%
we find more evidence of
our first sun, Saturn,

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:32.208 align:middle line:84%
in ancient imagery that matches
this scientific evidence.

00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>> As Proto-Saturn got
further into the solar system,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it must have reached the point
where that instability became

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
so great that it actually
ejected a fair proportion

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
of its core material, which
would be heavy elements,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was witnessed
and described.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Saturn was trying
desperately to remove charge

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and to satisfy its environment.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
The effect would be like
the expulsion of part

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of the surface of
Saturn, and it would

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
have been propelled into space
by the electric force, which

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
can overcome gravity
with no trouble at all.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So something the size of
Venus is like the cosmic egg

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
references, and also
the encircling serpent,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the snake biting its tail,
the uroborus imagery.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn became an
orbiting object around

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in the sky about
this central orb.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It, too, fell behind and
joined the entourage.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So we had Venus, Mars, and
Earth was the arrangement.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And this appearance
in the sky gave rise

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to the legends of the apple
of the eye and the eye

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, the Egyptian
Ra, the eye of Horus,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.946 align:middle line:84%
and we see this symbolism
even down to today.

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Venus have been
born from Saturn during this

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:90%
capturing process?

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how does
Venus help give birth

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:90%
to a new civilization?

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> How does order
come out of chaos?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is that, in
the pre-creation cosmos,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:84%
you had a situation described
as formlessness, and chaos,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:90%
and disorder.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
As we have reconstructed
those events,

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
you have the planet Venus
as the eye of Horus,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:84%
cascading around the sky
causing all of these disasters,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:90%
swallowing quote "the sun."

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point
in time, Venus

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
is brought back into stability
with the polar configuration.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:10%
And that reordering process
is equated with the creation

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:10%
of the cosmos.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%

universe's understanding

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:84%
of Venus' placement in the
heavens and the mythological

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:84%
representation of the
goddess in human culture.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.398 align:middle line:90%
