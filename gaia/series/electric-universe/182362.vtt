00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:10%
>> All around the world,
archaeologists have discovered

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:10%
that ancient monuments that have
stood the test of time align

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:10%
with the sun.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.970 align:middle line:84%
The great temple complex
of Karnak in Egypt

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:84%
appears to be oriented to
the direction of the summer

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:90%
solstice.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:10%
The famous Machu
Picchu site in Peru

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:10%
was associated with an Inca
cult that worshipped the sun,

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:10%
and in Europe, the
stones of Stonehenge

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:10%
show and alignment
to the appearance

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:10%
of the sun during the
summer and winter solstice.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:10%
This worldly worship of
the sun was important

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient people, but why?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
What significance
did our current sun

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
play in the lives
of the ancients,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and how can their
documentation of a sun god

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
lead to a better understanding
of the universe we

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:90%
live in today?

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, NASA launched its
Interstellar Boundary Explorer

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:90%
or IBEX.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
This satellite uses
energetic neutral atoms

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to image the interaction
region between the solar system

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and Interstellar space.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after its launch, it
detected something scientists

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
had never seen
before, a thin slice

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
or ribbon of energy
and particles

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
were discovered in
the heliosphere.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
This new finding overturned
40 years of theory

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and provided insight into
the fundamental structure

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
of the heliosphere.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:10%
According to NASA, this will
help scientists understand

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:10%
structures that surround our
solar system and other star

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:10%
systems throughout the galaxy.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:10%
According to Wallace
Thornhill, this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:10%
is proof of the electric
universe theory.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun gets its power like
all of the rest of the stars

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy, from the
electric currents flowing along

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the spiral arms and
into the center.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:10%
It's part of Alfven's
circuit, and as such, it

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:10%
collects electrical
energy from one

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:10%
of these Birkeland
current filaments, which

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:10%
must surround the solar system.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:10%
The evidence for this
has been found recently

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:10%
with the IBEX
mission, which found

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:10%
there's a ring of
bright spots out well

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:10%
beyond the heliosphere.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So our connection to the
galaxy has been discovered,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's not understood.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:10%
There is a lot of surprises
as a result of that,

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:10%
and I spoke to
the fellow who was

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:10%
in charge of the
experiment, and he

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:10%
said that when it
was discovered,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.825 align:middle line:10%
there were a lot of theories
about what would be found

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and there were predictions.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:10%
None of the predictions
proved to be correct,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:10%
and they gave up
predicting at some point

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:10%
as the results came back in.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:10%


00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:10%
The puzzle is that there
are these bright spots

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:10%
in a ring around
the solar system,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:10%
and this is where the
sun's circuit, Remember

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:10%
the solar wind is
a current shape

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:10%
and it flows outwards
in all directions.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Where it hits the filaments
going past the sun

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is like searchlight
beams through a cloud.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Where they hit the
cloud, they light up.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
they've discovered,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and they were amazed because
these bright spots move

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and change with time.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
This is totally inexplicable
in any standard thinking

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and remains a mystery.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But it is a part
of the signature

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
of the electrical connection
of the sun to the galaxy.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Prior to the IBEX mission,
most scientists believed that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
the global boundaries of our
solar system were controlled

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
mainly by the motion of our
solar system through the galaxy

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and the solar wind, which
is an extremely fast flow

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of electrically charged matter
that flows out of the sun.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:10%
The IBEX maps revealed the
galactic magnetic field is also

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:10%
a critical part of the sun's
interaction with the galaxy.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The spacecraft was organized
to scan the sky and find out

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
where they were coming
from and their energies.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So it was a big surprise
when this ring, which

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
was aligned with the
interstellar external magnetic

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
field, and remember,
electric currents

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:90%
follow the magnetic field.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So what the IBEX mission
and the Cassini spacecraft

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
were detecting were returns
from their hydrogen atom

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
nuclei, the protons,
picking up electrons

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
from the current that were
surrounding the solar system,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and then circling around in
the magnetic field and some

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of them returning back
into the solar system

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
so the spacecraft
could detect them.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
This was confirmation of
the electrical circuit

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
of the star, something that
Hannes Alfven decades earlier

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
had shown was necessary to
explain the solar wind itself.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
The electrical
model of stars has

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
a picture of how
the circuit works,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and every charged
object in plasma

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
surrounds itself
with a cell wall.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
This is almost biological
in its overtones.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:10%
That cell wall is what's
known as a plasma double layer

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:10%
or a plasma sheath, and they
were identified by the Nobel

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Prize winning Irving Langmuir
in the early 20th century.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
The plasma sheath
is a place where

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
most of the electric
field is to be found.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's only strong within
the so-called double layers

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:90%
or plasma sheaths.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So I predicted that when the
Voyager spacecraft reached

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the boundary of
the solar system,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the effects would not be there,
but just a plain bough wave

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
effect trying to play out
through the interstellar

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
medium, and this was borne out.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
To begin with the solar wind
seemed to slow to a halt

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's because there's
a reverse field very

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:90%
close to the boundary.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And then once passing
through that area,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
there is a voltage drop, which
is associated with cosmic rays.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:10%
All of these things were
fulfilled by Voyager 1,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:10%
and Voyager 2, as of
this date, is currently

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:10%
experiencing that same boundary
in a different direction

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:10%
from the sun.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things were supportive

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of the electric universe,
but none of them

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
were as powerful
as the discovery

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
of this strange ring
around the solar system

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:90%
by the IBEX mission.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this discovery
explain how the sun interacts

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the universe?

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
theory explains this

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
by going back to
the birth of a star.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In the electric universe,
galaxies are an electromagnetic

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, not a
gravitational phenomenon.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is why astronomers
have so much difficulty

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and have to invent dark matter
and so on to try and patch up

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Newton's law of gravity.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:10%
Once you accept electrical
activity and electric circuits

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:10%
in space, as suggested
strongly by Hannes Alfven,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:10%
you realize that we have an
entirely different mechanism

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.193 align:middle line:10%
for forming stars.

00:07:14.193 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about gravity anymore.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
electric currents.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And electric currents
in space, take

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
a form known as a
Birkeland current, which

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
is twin filaments.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
In deep space, the amount
of matter per cubic meter,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the density
of material, is extremely low.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It's counted in sort of
atoms per cubic meter.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the best vacuum
that we know of,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
so an electric current
flowing in deep space

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in between galaxies
or between stars

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
can only carry very
little current,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
but the sheer size of
these current filaments

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
can be light years across.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
When they're that
size, they don't

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
radiate any visible
light, but they

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
do give off radio
signals, which are

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
detected by radio telescopes.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
When these filaments arrive
at a cloud of denser material,

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
known as a molecular
cloud, in a galaxy,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
the effect is to
cause the current,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
because it can now flow
through a smaller aperture,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:90%
if you like, it constricts in.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
It's called an
electromagnetic pinch effect.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
As it comes in more
and more narrowly,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
if there's sufficient
material, the current density

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
gets to the point
where atoms begin

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.783 align:middle line:84%
to give off light and the
problem for many years

00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that dogged astronomers
was that they couldn't

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
see inside these clouds.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:84%
Visible light can't get through
all of the dust and material.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:84%
With the advent of infrared
space telescopes, which

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:84%
could see through the
clouds, astronomers

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
were amazed to find
these glowing filaments.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
They are the signatures of
these galactic current circuits.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the pinch
effect is one which

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
allows the electric current
to draw inwards surrounding

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
material, and it does it far
more effectively than gravity.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And because it is doing along
a line and not from a point,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
gravity always operates
in a point source of mass,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:90%
it collects material very well.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It's an extremely good kind of
vacuum cleaner, if you like,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in space, and all
the material needed

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.627 align:middle line:84%
to make stars and planets
are drawn together

00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:90%
along this filament.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.695 align:middle line:84%
Our sun was formed along
one of these filaments.

00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out because
they're twin filaments,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
it's usually a pair of
stars at the same time,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and the two of them are
rotating around one another.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Some stars, any other
object, or any other filament

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that's nearby, will not form
a partner with these two.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It'll be independent,
and you get

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:90%
single stars formed along them.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Now the sun may be one
of these single stars

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because it's known by
astronomers that binary stars

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.075 align:middle line:84%
are present in
remarkable numbers,

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's always been a
puzzle why is this so?

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Why are stars found in so many
pairs instead of single stars?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Once the stars are formed, they
become quite heavy, of course,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
after this formation
period, and the filaments,

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
just like in a
novelty plasma ball,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%
are moving, waving,
snaking about.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, the
stars are left behind

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and the filament moves on.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So then you have all
these bodies in a line,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
but they all have
their own motions,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
which can be either around each
other, or it's a little random.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
In the laboratory, it
was described to me

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:90%
by a top plasma physicist.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
The effect is like they
scatter like buckshot.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So after the event,
stars are scattered

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
in all directions away
from the central axis,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and planets are formed
at the same time,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
so all of the heavy elements
that form planets are put

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:90%
in place by the same mechanism.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And they form
partnerships, because

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the electrogravitic
model of interaction

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
between celestial bodies
shows that gravity

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
is long range repulsive
and short range attractive.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Stars being an
electrical phenomenon,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
they continue to shine because
the electric current flowing

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
through these clouds
is everywhere.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
There are minor filaments
alongside major ones,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
so the stars then shine
according to their environment.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
sun, it doesn't

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
seem to have needed to do
anything dramatic to continue

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:90%
to survive after its birth.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> How are we connected to
the same force as the sun?

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The Birkeland currents
transfer electrical energy

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to the planets, because we're
all part of the same circuit

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%
of the sun.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The other form of energy is
electromagnetic, which is slow

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and its a wave, like a
wave in the end of a rope.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:10%
When you do that, it
takes time for the energy

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:10%
to get to the other end,
and you detect the fact

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:10%
that the other person
is waving it at you.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.847 align:middle line:84%
But if the rope is taut,
which is the electric force,

00:11:55.847 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
you give a tug on this, and
the person on the other hand

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:90%
feels it immediately.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference,
and the universe

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
is connected by
this direct force.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're all connected
by invisible strings.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the answer to the
puzzle of quantum entanglement.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
How can you separate
two particles

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
by hundreds of kilometers, and
you flip one and the other one

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:90%
instantly knows to flip?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
The system has to be in balance.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
When you change
scale in physics,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
you've got to identify
what is the force that's

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:90%
dominating at this scale.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I said
galaxies are electromagnetic,

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and when you get down to
the solar system scale,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:90%
this is gravity.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
When you get down to the
atomic and subatomic,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
it's the electric force,
which is dominant.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about
biological molecules,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
they're a structure, and the way
they signal throughout the body

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:90%
is the direct electric force.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not even electromagnetism.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Magnetism isn't involved.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the direct connection, the
connectedness of all things.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So living systems act
as a coherent organism.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Every part of the body
knows instantly what

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the body is
doing, and this is essential.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it just
wouldn't work.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
There are trillions
of things going

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
on inside the body
at any instant,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and if you had to rely
on slow nerve signals

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and just at the speed of
light, it would be incoherent.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
electric universe,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.098 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
features of it, is resonances.

00:13:22.098 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Because when you've got
these direct connections,

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
you can create
resonance systems which

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:90%
are in harmony and stable.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Stability is the key.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Stability of the sun has
been a topic for researchers

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Could modern day scientists
be observing a connection

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
between the Earth and the sun?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
behavior of the sun

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
affect the Earth in the
electrical universe theory?

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The point of Kristian
Birkeland was looking at trying

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:10%
to understand the phenomena
observed on the sun,

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:10%
the sunspot cycle and so on, and
he did this by producing these

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:10%
little electrical device called
the terrella, the little earth,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:10%
inside a vacuum chamber, where
you apply electrical power

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:10%
and you produce the aurora, and
in effect the sunspot cycle,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:10%
because you can make the
discharges move up and down

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:10%
in latitude by
varying the voltage.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you apply this
model to the sun,

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that happens
is around the magnetized body,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
a current flows in a
circle around the body,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and energy is stored in that
doughnut of electric current.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The energy stored
can reach a point

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
where it discharges to the main
body that forms the sunspots.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the same kind of
thing can occur in the sun

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
as it does with the
Earth and so on,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and that is that you can get
discharges from the surrounding

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:52.288 align:middle line:84%
ionosphere or any charged layers
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the sun,
because the energy levels

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
are fairly high,
those discharges

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
take the form of coronal mass
ejections and solar flares.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
this is a case

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
where a star is ejecting
matter to achieve equilibrium.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So the charged matter
is shot into space.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
When it encounters
the Earth, it disturbs

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's electrical
environment and the earth

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
responds by changing the
rotation of the Earth

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
suddenly by creating auroras at
different levels of latitude.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Once again, this is
what Birkeland showed,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and also having effects
like triggering earthquakes,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
because earthquakes, I
think, in my opinion,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and based on all the evidence
associated with changes

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in the charge in the
ionosphere, and this is already

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
being measured and
noted, but it's always

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
thought that the earthquake is
causing the ionosphere changes.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest
it's the reverse.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
That it's the sudden change in
charge in the ionosphere, which

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.985 align:middle line:84%
is inducing electric
currents to flow

00:15:47.985 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface
of the Earth.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could the
sun's electrical interference

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
also affect the Earth
in a different way?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The phenomena known as ley
lines could also be looked

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
at electrically, and we know
that the currents flowing

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
in the ionosphere of the Earth
induce electric currents below

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:90%
the surface of the Earth.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that the
so-called ley lines, pathways,

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.003 align:middle line:84%
favor the passage of electric
current in the subsurface.

00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
There may be more
to it than that,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
because in the
electric universe,

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
there is more subtle
activities engendered

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
by the electric force, which is
involved in biological systems

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and things which are regarded
at present as taboo science.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.920 align:middle line:84%
The effects can be related
to even psychological effects

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
on humans and that
kind of thing.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We are all part of a
system, and that system

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:84%
has a system of
resonant signaling

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:90%
between all of the components.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So we are intimately
connected and some people

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
seem to be more sensitive
to that than others.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If we are all connected, how
does an electrical signal from

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
the universe affect all
the systems on one planet?

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The term subtle energy is
used a lot by natural healers

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:90%
and natural therapies.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe helps
provide an understanding

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:84%
of that concept,
because in effect,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:84%
any physical object,
a molecule or an atom,

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:90%
is a resonant system.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So each is singing at
different frequencies

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
all at the same time, but it's
not an electromagnetic signal.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a direct signal,
which cannot be shielded.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Just like gravity.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I said gravity
is this direct signaling,

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and that means that
throughout the whole body,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
all of the molecules of
the same construction

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:90%
are in tune with one another.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And like a set of
tuning forks, which

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:90%
attune to the same frequency.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
If you bring one
along and put it

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
on the board, which
is ringing, the others

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:84%
will all lock in
phase eventually.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with these
biological systems.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is a means
of communication

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that is not recognized
by physicists,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, it's not
passed on to biologists.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:10%
And it is a system
which is ignored

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:10%
by modern biology, which
is a shame because that is

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:10%
the underlying feature of life.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:10%
Presently, biology cannot
explain the difference between

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:10%
an animate and inanimate object.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:90%
That is the difference.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
However, even inanimate objects,
crystals and so on signal

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
each other because they will
resonate at the same frequency.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it
cannot be shielded.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:10%
So you can go even
further with this,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:10%
and there had been ESP and
remote viewing experiments,

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:10%
and they have been tested
inside a Faraday cage,

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:10%
which should remove all
electromagnetic signals,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:10%
and it still works, and the
reason is that the signal

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:10%
cannot be shielded.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And that goes even
deeper into the Earth

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
because they are now
discovering life at kilometers

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
deep in the rocks, and the
question is how on Earth

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
could life be started
under those conditions?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
says that the information

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to generate the living
organism is already available.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to be
created from scratch

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
in a sort of primordial soup.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The information is out there
because the universe is

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
of unknown age and extent,
and it's obviously learnt how

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to produce life under any given
conditions that are possible.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So when conditions
changed on the earth,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:84%
we had an outbreak of
new animals, ones that

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:90%
had never been seen before.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in the universe,
there is an environment

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
where those same kinds
of creatures existed.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The information is
already out there.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:10%
The universe and nature don't
waste anything, including

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:10%
information, and the
biologist Rupert Sheldrake

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:10%
has already introduced
this idea and has

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:10%
had it accepted
to a large degree,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:10%
and even tested
experimentally, and that

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:10%
is that embryo
genesis is controlled

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:10%
from signals outside the cell.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Signals from
outside the cell?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible the
ancient people understood

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
this new powerful sun and
how it influenced all living

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
systems on the planet?

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> According to our findings,
the sun god of ancient religion

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:84%
was a conjunction of planets,
and so the images will show

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
three planetary
bodies in conjunction.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have a larger planet,
planet Saturn, the planet Venus

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
located in the middle, and
then in the middle of Venus,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:90%
you have the planet Mars.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So at one level, it looks
like one giant orb in the sky,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
but as that configuration
evolves through time,

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the ancients became
aware that those

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:90%
were three separate bodies.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:10%
Because of course, Mars
travels up and down the axis

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:10%
and comes closer to the Earth
and moves away from Venus.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes obvious that Venus
is a separate planetary body.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The sun is clearly
there because it's

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
reflecting light
off of those bodies

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the sky,
the three bodies I was just

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And so at a particular
point in the history

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of the polar
configuration, a crescent

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:84%
appears on those bodies and
appears to rotate around

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
the sky, and so that
is clearly a reflection

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:90%
of our current sun.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So the ancients literally
they were in this bubble

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:90%
of let's call it plasma.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
We were in this bubble, so our
vision was directed northwards,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and we saw those three planets
on a string essentially,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but at some points
in time, they were

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
illuminated by a sun out here
somewhere that cast a crescent.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So earthlings could
see a crescent rotating

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:90%
around the sky.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When this sun moved in, the
people must have felt a shift.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Wall explains that ancient
remnants of these cultures

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
showed that when the
new sun moved in,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
it changed the magnetic
field of the Earth.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturn is an
anomaly, for instance,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that they cannot explain
its magnetic field.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think there is
a good explanation anyway.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:84%
However, when two electrically
different bodies approach

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
one another, and there's an
exchange of electrical charge,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:84%
those currents that
flow are enormous

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and they will cause the
magnetic field at the time

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to vary in ways which don't
match any current theory.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.818 align:middle line:84%
But they will be
recorded by the rocks,

00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and the rocks have to
be heated at the time

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and be cooling when that
magnetic field is different

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain a
record of the reversed field.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.535 align:middle line:84%
In the case of pottery, it had
to be being fired in the kiln

00:22:36.535 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and cooling through its
magic temperature, where

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
it traps the magnetic
field at the. time.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And there is pottery
from the Middle East,

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:90%
which shows a reversed field.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, I know that at the
time of the Aboriginal peoples,

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a camp site where the
material there was investigated

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and found that there
was a magnetic reversal

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
within their existence
in Australia.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that
some of the times when

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:84%
we were being
electrically interfered

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
with by some other nearby body,
it also adds weight to the fact

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that, well, the the solar
system and the earth

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
have a recent history
of encounters.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If the ancient people felt
a shift on the planet from

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the sun's energy, could they
have understood how everything

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:90%
is connected?

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Would this
understanding have been

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
a new way of using
energy in a way

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:90%
that they could manipulate it?

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of theories that
suggest ancient cultures were

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
able to lift stones with sound
or the use of electricity

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.930 align:middle line:90%
was a part of their life.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
What influences could the sun
have had on ancient cultures?

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for
certain, they wanted

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
to track its course
in the sky, but why?

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Wall points out that by
us understanding the sun

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.620 align:middle line:84%
like the ancients did, we
might be able to influence

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:90%
our life on Earth today.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> By understanding the sun as
an electrical phenomenon opens

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.102 align:middle line:84%
up the question of
nuclear reactions.

00:24:08.102 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:84%
If they're taking
place on the sun,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
what are they, and
are they of use

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:90%
in producing power on Earth?

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Of course, the mantra we
hear when billions of dollars

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:10%
are spent on fusion research
to produce power like the sun,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:10%
it assumes that the standard
model of the sun is correct

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:10%
and the electric
universe says it is not.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So if we can find
out what is going on

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in this electrical environment
on the surface of the sun,

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
when I say the surface,
the visible surface,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the photosphere, there
is an opportunity

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
the sun really works

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.308 align:middle line:84%
and how it really
produces energy apart

00:24:45.308 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
from just the electrical input.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of research
being done right now

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:90%
on nuclear transmutation.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:90%
That's not nuclear fusion.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That is the production of
heavier elements and isotopes

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
by low energy means, which
produces excess energy,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
but without all of
the radioactive waste

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and other problems
that are associated

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.315 align:middle line:84%
with the standard
nuclear power systems.

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So the electric
universe opens up

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of possibilities
for the future.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:10%
It asks different questions.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It gives different answers.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And for technologists,
this is a goldmine

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:84%
because this opens
up ways and means

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
of doing things that were
not considered in the past.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If we are able to understand
how the sun functions,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
could we transcend those
concepts to how we use power

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, both
subtle and direct?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Electric universe theory
weaves gather evidence

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of a force that connects all.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Yet it also suggests
that the symbols that

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
are ingrained in
our minds are also

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
a reaction to an electric
encounter our ancients

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
witnessed in the sky.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:84%
If this is all true, how
does cosmology and mythology

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:84%
reveal a human pattern on
this planet that can only be

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
broken by means of knowledge?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And could this
knowledge release us

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:90%
from our fear of destruction?

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Serpents, dragons, Saturn
cults, and the Resurrection

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:90%
of the universe, next.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:27.584 align:middle line:90%
