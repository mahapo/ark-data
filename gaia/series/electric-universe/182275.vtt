00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars, the planet fourth
from the sun and known for its

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
conspicuous red color has
fascinated man for thousands

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle line:84%
By the end of 2018, there
were eight active spacecraft

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
either orbiting or investigating
the surface of Mars.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:84%
There are also
private groups that

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
boasts they will be
building the first colony

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Mars.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a human obsession that
drives scientists, astronomers,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
explorers, and
sci-fi writers mad.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But why Mars?

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
This passionate pursuit to
discover life on the red planet

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:84%
may be fueled by something
deeper than curiosity.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It could be triggered
by an ancient memory.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, what is it
we are trying to understand

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Mars?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The Electric Universe theory
suggests that not only could

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
there have been
life on Mars, but it

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is one of the only planets
that holds the most

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:84%
evidence that 10,000 years ago,
an electrical encounter wreaked

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.547 align:middle line:84%
havoc on our current
solar system.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
"National Geographic"
published an article titled

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
"Did Life on Earth
Come From Mars?"

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
In the article, two
scientists gather evidence

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that Mars had certain elements
for early development of life

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:84%
that Earth seemed
to be scarce of.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Their theory suggests
that a meteorite hit Mars

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and that the debris
from that impact

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
made its way to Earth's
surface, carrying

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:90%
these elements we needed.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:90%
This brings up two questions.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
If Mars had these necessary
elements for life,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
could that mean that life
existed on Mars already?

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, could
this impact on Mars

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
have been an electrical
encounter with Earth,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:90%
and not a meteorite from space?

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Electric Universe
unravels a riveting case

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
for those questions.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.847 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the big puzzles about
the Earth has been its oceans,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.775 align:middle line:84%
because the hydrogen and
oxygen that makes up the water

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
in the oceans should have
been, according to the standard

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
theory, blown into the outer
reaches of the solar system

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
during the early phase
of the sun's existence.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was the argument
for the formation of the gas

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
giants.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:10%
They were thought to be mostly
the gases that were blown out

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:10%
from the inner solar system.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The answer that
they came up with

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the Earth suffered
bombardment by comets.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And comets brought
water to the Earth

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.915 align:middle line:84%
after its formation
and the other planets

00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:90%
that were in place.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't stand
up because now

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
that we've actually
looked at comets,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
water that was expected.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Electric Universe

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
explains that too, because
the water is actually

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
formed electrically from
the minerals on the surface.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
When we look closely
at comets, they've

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
shown they've got
rocky surfaces.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The simple answer is that
the atmosphere and the oceans

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth were formed by
this continual misting down

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of material being
lost from Saturn.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that Mars
also had the same environment.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
That also indicates
that we should

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
expect that there was life
on Mars at that period,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and that even after
all that devastation,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
perhaps someday we
may be able to detect

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
the fossils of lifeforms.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If Mars had the same
environment as Earth,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
why did Mars end up a barren
red planet while Earth continued

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:90%
to carry life?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The break up of the system
must have consisted of a series

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
of episodes, some of them
violent and destructive,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
others more benign, which gave
any lifeforms a chance to try

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and regroup and figure out what
they could do to avoid being

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:90%
wiped out the next time.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that also gives rise to
this idea of the recurrence

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:84%
and predicting it's
going to happen again

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
because in that era, the
chances were pretty high.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Each time these
events occurred, there

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
would have been a change
in atmospheric content,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:84%
the amount of atmosphere,
and those kinds of things.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
We know, for certain, that this
also occurred on the Earth.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
On Mars being a smaller
body, the changes

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
would have been more dramatic.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that if
there were people on Mars,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
they would have had to
survive in a reduced

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
atmosphere, for instance,
find it difficult to breathe.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds
of things that one

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
can speculate about
and try and form

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
a picture of what these
events must mean for living

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.531 align:middle line:90%
creatures on their surfaces.

00:04:55.531 --> 00:05:00.816 align:middle line:84%
>> How is this explained using
the Electric Universe model?

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Each of the
satellites of Saturn,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Earth in particular,
would have had to find

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
their new place in
the solar system.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, under the Newtonian
model, of course,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:84%
this would have been
impossible in the short time

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:84%
frame we've been talking about,
10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it would have
been impossible simply

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
because having introduced
chaos into the solar system,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.063 align:middle line:84%
there's no way of restoring
order, no simple way.

00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Some bodies would have been
flung out of the solar system,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
others crashed into others
based on the standard thinking.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
The Electric Universe
model says that the bodies

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:90%
would avoid collisions.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they came
close, they would

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
exchange electric
charge, which would

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
change their mass,
their gravity,

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and, therefore, their orbit.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
mechanism that spaced

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.675 align:middle line:84%
all of the progeny
of proto-Saturn

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
at the various distances that we
find them in the solar system.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:10%
There's research to be done to
understand how this achieves

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:10%
what is known as the Bode's
relationship between the orbits

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:10%
of planets.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
There are things going on in
the Electric Universe which

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
are not considered at
present, and that is there

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
are resonances.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
There are resonances
within subatomic particles.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
There are resonances
within atoms,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
within biological
systems, within crystals,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:90%
at every scale.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
the solar system,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
there is a
gravitational resonance.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If this resonance between
planets caused massive damage

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
on a once Earth-like planet,
where can we find evidence

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
of that?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's important to
visualize the towering size

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.325 align:middle line:10%
of the planet Mars as it neared
the vicinity of the Earth.

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It would have been many times
bigger than the current moon.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But as Mars moved
closer to the Earth,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
you have to imagine
unbelievable pyrotechnics

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, certainly a lot
of electromagnetic effects,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot of auroral effects.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars, at its closest, was
about 40 times the diameter

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:90%
of the moon in the sky.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
You can understand the
sheer fright and awe

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient observers
and the concern

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that the things that were
happening around them

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
were signals of the
end of the world.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It also explains the strange
motivation for ancients

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
to build huge rock
structures with rocks

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that we'd have difficulty moving
with our modern equipment.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
very rudimentary.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
They appear mainly
to have shielded

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:90%
from things falling from above.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And that fits, of course,
with all of the stories

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:90%
of stones falling from heaven.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The meteorites that fell were
associated with lightning.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:90%
They're called lightning stones.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So the two, together,
came together,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the interplanetary lightning
and the falls of rocks,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and stone, and
dust from the sky.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And also, that fits with
the biblical accounts

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
of the plagues of
Egypt and so on.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.417 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have a situation where
Mars' meteorites are falling

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth in
tremendous abundance,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
it goes without saying that
there's a possibility that

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Mars' microorganisms eventually
made their way to the Earth.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.225 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the features that
it was recently discovered,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
once we'd learned what the
composition of Mars' atmosphere

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
is and what the
rocks were made from,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
it was understood then that
some meteorites that have been

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
collected on Earth were
actually from Mars.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, that
recently arrived ones,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
amongst that discovery, which
shows that there is still

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.942 align:middle line:84%
debris from the Martian
sculpting arriving on Earth.

00:08:54.942 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What would this sculpting
have looked like from

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
the surface of Earth?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.884 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.884 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars was the archetype
of the warrior hero.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:10%
The reason for that was that,
in this electrical environment,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:10%
it was traveling between Venus
and the Earth repeatedly.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So it would retreat
along the rotation axis

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of all the objects
in this line, and it

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:90%
would move up towards Venus.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Venus, at that time,
was discharging

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
in a greenish color,
interestingly enough,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
but Mars' red color was obvious.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
As it moved up towards
Venus, it would

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
sit within the
green ring of Venus

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
as if it was an eye
with a red pupil.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
When it approached
the Earth, there

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
would be electrical
activity which

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
would make Mars
move away, back down

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:90%
the column towards the Earth.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And as it approached the
Earth, it became gigantic.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was a threat
to the Earth.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Its appearance, as
it got close enough,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
was such that
material being removed

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
from the surface of
Mars electrically would

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:90%
descend towards the Earth.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And looking up at this
descending material,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a red dagger,
so that globally, you

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
will see images of Mars, and
you will also hear references

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
to the sword of Mars.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was
the sword of Mars?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It was this appendage of
material, dust and gases,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:84%
stretching towards the Earth,
towards the northern pole,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:90%
it seems.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.966 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.966 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the ancient
sources, a towering,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
gigantic tornado or hurricane
descended from Mars with

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:90%
disastrous effects.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a
two-day phenomenon.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
This was a phenomenon
that lasted for months,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:90%
if not years.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So it was remembered as
a tremendous hurricane

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that circled around
as a giant corkscrewing-like

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:90%
serpent and effected a disaster.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
that same entity

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
was looked upon as the
single leg of heaven and/or

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
as the world
pillar-like structure

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:90%
that actually supported heaven.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
In order for all those
different thematic patterns

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to be associated with it, it
had to be a sustained phenomenon

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
to allow that many different
symbols to originate

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in the first place,
which would be visualized

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:84%
as a towering structure
spanning the circumpolar sky

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:90%
above the Earth.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Virtually every
culture on the Earth

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
commemorated that mountain in
their monumental structures.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
The Maya pyramids, for
example, are called mountains.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids of Egypt
certainly would fall into that.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
The Babylonian
ziggurats were certainly

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:90%
identified as a mountain.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And those mountains
were ascribed

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
the exact same characteristics
as the mountain in the sky.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So they did not distinguish
between the two entities.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
That mountain on the Earth
was the mountain in heaven.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And probably the
best example of that

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:90%
is the ziggurats in Mesopotamia.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
They typically included a
bull's-like horn on the top

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
of the ziggurat.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they compared that to
the shining horns in heaven.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We all are familiar with those
ancient pictographs of the sun

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
They will always
have the sun setting

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:90%
within a crescent-like horn.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when that
world mountain is

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
putting a single set
of horns on its apex,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
it is literally
commemorating the horns

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that they saw in the sky,
the twin-peaked mountain.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.572 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> How did humans
incorporate this red planet

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
into their understanding
of the world?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Mars plays a prominent
role in all ancient religions

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, ancient
man's life revolved around war,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
hunting and war.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Mars was
the warrior planet.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
When man marched
off to war, they

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
emulated the behavior
of the planet Mars.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So all of your
great warrior gods,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
in virtually every
culture, they will always

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
be identified with
the planet Mars.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't us
identifying it.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
peoples themselves.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
They will say Horus
was the planet Mars.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:84%
That's what the New
Kingdom texts say.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The Greek Heracles
was identified

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.215 align:middle line:90%
with the planet Mars.

00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Mars featured prominently
in ancient cultures

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
also as the king of the gods.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take the
Egyptian religion, for example,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
already in the
"Pyramid Texts," Horus

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
is represented as a star,
a dominant star in the sky.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And he is specifically
called the king of the gods.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptian pharaohs, each
one of them took a Horus name.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So they called themselves
Horus so and so.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So they were emulating
the king of the gods.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
They were emulating the
planet Mars in their behavior.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:10%
In New Kingdom
text when astronomy

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:10%
starts to become
developed, they identify

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:10%
Horus with the red
planet, the planet Mars.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of historical record

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptian kings
boasted about being like Horus.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.558 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to model
their behavior on Horus.

00:14:41.558 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars was the central
axis of this cosmic wheel

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
because the radiating
streams from Venus, at times,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
looked like the
spokes of a wheel.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And Mars would form the hub.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Even the imagery that you see
in the shields of warriors

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
would have the embossed hub
in the center of the shield

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:90%
and the radiating streamers.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was a
re-imaging of that ancient sky.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.542 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars is certainly the
most active player in ancient

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
mythology together with Venus.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That's not only because it
was closest to the Earth,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
but because it was
bobbing up and down

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the polar configuration.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it was involved
in a lot of skirmishes

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:90%
with the other planets.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's famous for
being a shape-shifter.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes on a bunch
of different appearances

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
over the course of time
and the history associated

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:90%
with the polar configuration.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So the most familiar story
involves the planet Mars

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
as the lover of
the planet Venus.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And we understand that as
representing, or symbolizing,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
the planet Mars in
conjunction with Venus.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And so Venus is the
larger object in the sky.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Mars appears to
penetrate that object

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and sits within its middle.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
grand conjunction.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, in North
America, the Skidi Pawnee

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:90%
had a star-based religion.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Their creation myth said
that creation resulted

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
from the planet Mars having
a sexual relationship

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
with the planet Venus,
and that all life

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:90%
stemmed from that sexual act.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
That story, as we
understand it, is

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
virtually identical
to the story of Inanna

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.910 align:middle line:84%
being involved with the sacred
marriage with Dumuzi or Adonis,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:84%
the planet Mars in
ancient Samaria.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the same
story as Aphrodite,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the planet Venus being involved
with Aries in Greek myth.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, myths
all around the world

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
will always describe the planet
Mars as the warrior planet.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:09.765 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>> During these encounters
with Mars when it came down

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:10%
the polar column
towards the Earth,

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:10%
the first effect would be
discharges that were what they

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:10%
call dark mode.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
So you would have
these tornadoes.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
But instead of just extending
out into the upper atmosphere,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
they extended into space and
stretched towards the Earth.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So the red, dusty
tongue would have

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
been dust raised from
the red surface of Mars.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.903 align:middle line:84%
As the discharge increased in
strength, as Mars got closer,

00:17:41.903 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
there would also be
electrical activity.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And it would then begin to
create damage on the Earth

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So this damaging sword,
it all fits together

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.715 align:middle line:90%
with this warrior image of Mars.

00:17:55.715 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could there
be more evidence on the surface

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of Mars of such a battle?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The features on Mars'
surface were unexpected when

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:10%
the Mariner
spacecraft flew past.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, I
think the first time,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:10%
it went when there was
one of these dust storms

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:10%
and the surface was obscured.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But Mount Olympus,
the largest mountain

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
amongst the solar plants in
the solar system, was seen.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:90%
And that was a puzzle.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
When the clouds cleared,
the gigantic valley

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.520 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, the Valles
Marineris, became evident.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was a surprise,
too, by its sheer size

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and the scale of the canyons.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:10%
At its deepest points, if you
were to stand on the edge--

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:10%
and imagine you're doing
this at the Grand Canyon,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:10%
which at its deepest
is 1.6 kilometers--

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.215 align:middle line:10%
on Mars, the Valles
Marineris, if you

00:18:47.215 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:10%
were to peer over
the edge, you'd

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:10%
be looking down 9 kilometers.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:10%
It would be like being in
a high-flying aircraft.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
The major channels
of that canyon

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
stretch a third of the
way around the planet.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And the material that's
missing from that canyon

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:10%
is equivalent to several million
cubic kilometers of rock.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The material that was
shot into space from Mars,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:90%
some would go into orbit.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The moons of Mars are probably
material that stayed in orbit.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The others would be
transferred to the body

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was exchanging the
electrical discharges to.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And the rest would be
meteorites, cometary material,

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.148 align:middle line:90%
and asteroids.

00:19:31.148 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.542 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Mars, I think, is
actually in the asteroid belt.

00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
some asteroids are

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
characterized by their
redness, the same as Mars.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to predict
that once we begin

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to test the surfaces
of these objects,

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's beginning
now in the space age,

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we will see resemblances
to the material from Mars.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt, I
think, is the scene

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
of the breakup of
Mars from that system.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And that asteroid
belt, of course,

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
exists between Mars'
present orbit and Jupiter.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:10%
The astronomer Tom Van
Flandern calculated the orbits

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:10%
of the asteroids, and also
of the short-period comets,

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:10%
and found that if
you retro calculate

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:10%
some thousands of
years, they appear

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:10%
to have all had a fairly
common origin, which

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:10%
is exactly what you would
expect under these conditions.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is an important
way of gaining evidence

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:90%
for this particular explanation.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to understand the
sheer volume of the material

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
that has formed these objects--
comets, and asteroids,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and meteorites--
by the very fact

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that there were
about four kilometers

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of the northern hemisphere
of Mars removed during all

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of this electrical activity.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And the different
type of scarring

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
on the southern
hemisphere are all

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
indicative of electrical
activity on a vast scale.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:02.672 align:middle line:84%
>> How could this scarring have
affected a once lush planet?

00:21:02.672 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mars suffered terribly.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Its atmosphere was
practically stripped off,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
a huge part of its
surface was stripped off.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And the characteristics
of electrical scars

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
are seen everywhere
on that planet,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
both in Olympus Mons, which
is an anode-type surface

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
discharge where the
material is raised

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
from the surface like a blister,
and that whole area has all

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
of the features of what's
called a fulgurite scar, which

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
lightning creates when it
hits a lightning arrester.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And then nearby is
this giant canyon

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of Valles Marineris, which is
more of a cathode-type scar.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And even the features along
the rims of that giant gash,

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the side canyons fulfill
all of the characteristics

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of an electric discharge with
coronal right angle discharges

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:90%
from the main channel.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
The severity of the
discharge to Mars,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
you can't underestimate
it, because that pattern

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Grand Canyon doesn't
show the characteristics

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:90%
of the one on Mars.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The one on Mars has the shape
of a barred spiral galaxy.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Spiral galaxies are
the most gigantic form

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:84%
of the electric discharge
in the universe.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So Mars culped an
electrical blast

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
which was sufficient to imprint
the image of a spiral galaxy

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:90%
on its surface.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this imprint on Mars
mark the biggest evidence

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
for proof that we live
in an Electric Universe?

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If so, could the moons
of Mars add to the story?

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The evidence for the
electrical birth of the moons

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of Mars is clearly written
across the face of Phobos,

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
the largest Martian moon.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
It has one giant crater at
one end, Stickney crater.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And radiating from that are all
of these electrical channels

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
traveling to the other
end of the small moon.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
This is characteristic
of an object

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that's caught up in a
discharge between it

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
and two other objects.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:90%
And you'll get cratering.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
the electric current

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
flowing around the body
towards the other end.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You see it also in other
moons in the solar system.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Their birth process
involved being caught up

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
in the discharge channel.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And so one side has
chaos, craters, and so on.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you see these
channels going around

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
to the other side in a similar
kind of odd chaotic region

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter's moon Europa
has these features.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Phobos, there
is no good explanation.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's more a case
of just making up

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
a story about Stickney crater,
because any physical impact

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to create that crater should
have shattered the moon.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:10%
But of course, an
electric discharge

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:10%
is machining it very
accurately with no debris left,

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:10%
so you have a very clean crater.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
electrical channels

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
from the rim hitting
around the moon,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
it was formed in an
electrical event.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And the obvious source of
the material for that moon

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.341 align:middle line:90%
is Mars itself.

00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the red color
of Mars also play a part

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.716 align:middle line:84%
in the electrically
damaged planet?

00:24:13.716 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The red color of Mars is
due to the presence of an iron

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:90%
oxide mineral called hematite.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the puzzles,
when the first landings

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
were successful on
Mars, was the discovery

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of vast fields of blueberries.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
They're little
droplets of hematite

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that had been modified,
in some fashion,

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
from just the rock material.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
One of our people in
the Thunderbolts group

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
did experiments in
his home laboratory

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
taking hematite with
electric discharges.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:90%
And he produced the blueberries.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So those strewn fields
of countless numbers

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of these tiny
Martian blue spheres

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
can be accounted for by
their electrical production

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
in the sculpting of
the surface of Mars.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's notable that when
the first landers switched

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
on their cameras on
the surface of Mars,

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that when they
looked around, it was

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:84%
strewn with broken
rocks, quite sharp rocks,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
so they hadn't been sitting
around for billions of years.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what
you would expect

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
from having vast amounts of
material lofted upwards, a lot

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:84%
of it into space,
some of it into orbit,

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and others just falling
back all around the planet

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
at different distances.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So those strewn
fields of sharp rocks

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.350 align:middle line:84%
easily explained based
on this Electric Universe

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:90%
reconstruction.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the evidence from
mythology and science prove

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that Mars was once an Earth-like
planet with life that was

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
destroyed heavily in electrical
encounters with Venus

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and Earth?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, could
our pursuit as earthlings

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.150 align:middle line:84%
be to uncover a lost
civilization that

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
disappeared 10,000 years
ago in our solar system?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an aspect of the
Electric Universe that's very

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
important to understand and that
is the connectedness of things.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The present science tends to
separate things, isolate them,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and look at the vast
distances and the time spans

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that it would take for
light or even travel

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.590 align:middle line:90%
between these objects.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And we feel isolated on our
beautiful blue planet, which

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:84%
is insignificant in
the vastness of space,

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
orbiting and insignificant
star in the galaxy.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And it gives a sense of
isolation and meaninglessness

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%
to our existence.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:84%
The Electric Universe
says quite the opposite,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected to the
rest of the universe in ways

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.228 align:middle line:90%
that we have yet to discover.

00:26:41.228 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics knows
about it because they

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
call it entanglement and
spooky action at a distance.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They are limited because they
cannot understand how a signal

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:84%
can transfer from one thing to
another faster than the speed

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet the evidence is
right before our eyes.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The Earth orbits the
sun where the sun

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:84%
is at this instant, not
where we see it in the sky

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
8 and 1/2 minutes later.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And the same goes
for all the planets.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They know where the sun is, and
the sun knows where they are.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And we would not have a
clockwork solar system

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:90%
if it was otherwise.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It kind of gives some
idea that the ancients

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:84%
knew that the planets influenced
us, and severely at times

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:84%
when everything was going
crazy in the solar system.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The position of all the bodies
in the solar system known

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
to a living organism at
the instant that something

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.041 align:middle line:90%
happens to that organism.

00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If the solar
configuration is true,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.035 align:middle line:84%
how does our electric sun
fit into the living organism?

00:27:44.035 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Up next, the sun and
its electric power

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
that feeds the solar system.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
