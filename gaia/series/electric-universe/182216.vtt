00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Venus, it is commonly
known as Earth's twin sister,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%
given that it is
similar in size, mass,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and proximity to the sun.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:84%
However, it couldn't be
more radically different

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:90%
than our home planet.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Venus has a longer rotation
period than any other planet

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It rotates in the
opposite direction.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It does not have any
natural satellites.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And temps on the surface can
reach 863 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a reason why
this completely different planet

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:90%
is called our sister planet?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
After the sun and
the moon, Venus

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is the third brightest
body in our sky.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And because of
this, most experts

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
believe this is why it
received lots of attention

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
from all the great
ancient civilizations.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But could Venus have
played another role

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
in the history of our planet,
as well as the beginning

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.115 align:middle line:90%
of our civilization?

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
In Roman mythology,
Venus was the goddess

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of love, sex, beauty,
and fertility.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
She was the Roman counterpart
to the Greek Aphrodite.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
However, Roman Venus
had many abilities

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:90%
beyond the Greek Aphrodite.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
She was also the
goddess of victory.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
According to
Hesiod's "Theogony,"

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Aphrodite was born of
the foam from the sea

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
after Saturn, Greek Cronus,
castrated his father Uranus

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:90%
and his blood fell to the sea.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
pieces of artwork

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:84%
where she emerges from
the sea as if born

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom of the ocean.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
Electric Universe team,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
although this is
recorded as a myth,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
there might be evidence that
millions of people on Earth

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:84%
could have witnessed
the birth of Venus

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.054 align:middle line:90%
in the sky 10,000 years ago.

00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So the ancients, they
witnessed the expulsion

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:90%
and departure from Saturn.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.207 align:middle line:84%
There would have been
an ionospheric display,

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
which would've been
quite spectacular.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
would have lit up.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Saturn was trying
desperately to remove charge

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:10%
and to satisfy its environment.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
The effect would be of
like the expulsion of part

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%
of the surface of Saturn.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And remember that even though
it was a brown dwarf star,

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:90%
every star has a planetary core.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So the material
would have been hot

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and it would have been
propelled into space

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
by the electric force,
which can overcome gravity

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
with no trouble at all.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So something the size of Venus,
or a planetary-sized object,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
can be expelled from another
more giant planetary object.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The active ejection, if
Saturn's rotating this way,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
for argument's sake,
the ejected matter

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
will eventually
tend to coalesce.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
As the preceding matters
gains in mass and slows down,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
the matter following will pile
up and form a large object.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
If Saturn's rotating
this way, this

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
will be giving her a backward
kick, just like emission gears,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
which means that this planet,
this newly-formed planet,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.975 align:middle line:84%
is glowing red hot and it is
rotating slightly backwards.

00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't stay
there long enough

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize this
rotation to match

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
its orbital rate
around its parent

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
like all other
satellites tend to do.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Wal believes this
newly-formed satellite was none

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.916 align:middle line:90%
other than Venus.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Venus, having been
expelled during this process,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is also accelerating
away from its entourage

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, it
would spiral in and form

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%
part of the polar column.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, its tail is not
lost during all of this.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And this spiraling
is shown in the eye

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
of Ra, the Egyptian
eye, where you

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:90%
have this curl beneath the eye.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That is a
representation of Venus

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
as its establishing its own
journey after separation

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
from proto-Saturn.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this
discharging would

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.256 align:middle line:84%
have made it a phenomenal
sight in the sky.

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The team dissects more
interpretations of this

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.551 align:middle line:90%
newly-formed goddess in the sky.

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole episode of Venus as
a soul is a fascinating story.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It's one that will be
familiar with the dying god

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
myth made famous by James
Frazer's "Golden Bough" series.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And in different
exemplars of that myth,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
the great god's lock of
hair disappears, runs off

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:90%
with his soul.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:10%
And so the example
from the Greek myth

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:10%
would be King Pterelaus,
his lock of hair

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:10%
rushes off as a woman
called Comaetho.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And Comaetho was an
epithet of Aphrodite.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
As you look into those
myths around the globe,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
they're especially
popular in ancient Egypt

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
where a lock of
hair is responsible

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
for early disasters, you
quickly figure out, or deduce,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that the planet Venus,
during its comet-Ike phase,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
was interpreted
as a lock of hair.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the planet
Venus was engaged

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
in a series of
activities spanning

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
many hundreds of
years, of course,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
so it wasn't just a
stable object in the sky.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So at one time, it would
look like an eye, let's say,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:90%
when in conjunction with Mars.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
At another time it would
look like a dragon.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But in one of the
earliest episodes

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is when the great
god dies and she

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
departs as a comet-like
object and is said

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:90%
to have wandered about the sky.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And the goddesses in
question, like Isis, Aphrodite

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
would be the other,
they are always

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
wandering with disheveled hair,
a classic example of a comet.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And so they had certain rituals.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was all part of
worshipping departed souls.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Elitist is the Greek
word for wander.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So the wandering goddess
is simply a variation upon

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
the global motif of the planet
Venus as a mourning goddess,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
as in M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G. So that's
like when Ishtar's lover dies,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
she mourns, wanders
the world mourning.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:10%
When Osiris dies, Isis wanders
the world with disheveled hair,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:10%
mourning the loss
of her consort.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is archetypal
myth associated

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.801 align:middle line:90%
with the planet Venus.

00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Venus, according
to ancient accounts,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
would make such a spectacle
in the sky that it would lend

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
itself to more archetypes that
show up in our modern world.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This thing would draw out
into a tail which would then,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
by the time it
came around again,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:84%
would close the circuit and
there would be a complete

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%
circle.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It would be the uroboros,
a snake swallowing

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
its tail image.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, over a short period
of time, because proto-Saturn,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
in all of this time, is
trying to accelerate away

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
from its satellite, Venus
would keep circling,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
but it would spiral
back until it

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
was in this lineup along
with Mars and Earth.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
have this amazing image

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
of these concentric circles.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that when you
look at images from Roman times

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and so on, this circle with
an inner circle, and spokes,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and a raised boss,
or hub, or axle,

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.725 align:middle line:84%
it's a universal
piece of symbolism.

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
idea that this is

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
where the cosmic wheel, the
idea of the wheel, really,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in the sky,
the archetype of the wheel,

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
with the raised axle, or the
red center, which was Mars.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the symbol of the
wheel in the sky have been

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
the inspiration for the use
of the wheel in mysticism,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and also the creation of
a wheel for practical use?

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Our team reminds us that Venus
inspired Earthlings as well

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:90%
as it tortured them.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And this symbolism
of the evil goddess

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.566 align:middle line:84%
can be seen throughout
many of the mythologies.

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In order to understand
the symbolism associated with

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
the planet Venus, it's important
to remember that these events

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
went on over the
course of centuries.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
And so Venus
endured some periods

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
of tremendous catastrophe
and electrical interactions.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some
more stable episodes

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:84%
where she took on a completely
different appearance.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The thematic pattern
of the goddess

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:84%
as a terrible dragon-like
woman and/or Medusa

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
has reference to her
wildly disheveled hair

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
projecting outwards
like spiraling snakes.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
The dragon, in the ancient
myths, has seven heads.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
In the early pictures
from Mesopotamia

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
will show a dragon with
seven heads and the warrior

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:90%
heroes conquering that dragon.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:10%
Well, those seven
heads elsewhere

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:10%
appear on the head of the mother
goddess, virtually inseparable.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The writhing serpentine
hair-like projection

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
spiraling from the
head of the Medusa

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the seven
heads of the dragon.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
the Medusa originated.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly a classic
symbol of the terrible goddess.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.145 align:middle line:84%
Another very common myth
is called the goddess

00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:90%
as the hag myth.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this horribly
disheveled, ugly, witch-like

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
goddess holds the
key to the kingdom.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And she's always trying to
find some warrior to marry her.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they always refuse.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Finally, one warrior's brave
enough to try and take her on.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And he instantly becomes
the king of the world.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's the story
of the goddess

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
turning from the ugly,
dragon-like Eye of Horus

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
type of situation and becoming
this beautiful Venusian

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
goddess that's now the consort
of the king moving forward.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
At a subsequent
period after Venus

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
became stabilized in its
orbit and circled around Mars,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
it takes on a
beautiful appearance.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> How can we see this concept
in our modern-day references

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.908 align:middle line:90%
and storytelling?

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:46.044 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:10%
>> A famous Freudian
psychologist named Erich

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Neumann wrote a very influential
book called "The Great Mother."

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
In this book, he describes
the terrible aspects

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess, as well
as the positive aspects

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And he does it from the
standpoint of depth psychology.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So from his standpoint, the
terrible Medusa-like goddess

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is always a projection
of the unconscious.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, at some
point in the book,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
he just says, in the
myths and dreams of people

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
all around the globe,
the witch always

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
appears in the exact same form.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
She has disheveled hair, a
long, haggard nose, green color,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:90%
lots of times snaky hair.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says, these images
still show up in our dreams

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and they are always the same.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But he will never
offer an explanation

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.535 align:middle line:84%
of how does that memory
get into the human brain.

00:11:46.535 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And our answer is,
the witch corresponds

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to a historical event
involving the planet Venus.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So in ancient
Babylonian astronomy,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.850 align:middle line:84%
when they point to
the planet Venus,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
they specifically call
it the witch star.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The Norse people did
the exact same thing.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So did the people
in ancient Arabia.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that the planet
Venus itself was a witch

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and was the witch star, it's
an archetypal motif many, many

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years old.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
That image was so powerful,
it became deeply ingrained

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:90%
on the human psyche.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:90%
That's why it appears in dreams.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It has a historical foundation.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, where do we
see other negative attributes

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
attached to the concept of
Venus from the point of view

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.912 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient people?

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The most horrifying incident
to the ancient peoples,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
if you read the early Greek
authors, the Latin authors,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
especially the
Mesoamerican authors,

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
they were terrified by
eclipses of the sun.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So when the sun
was eclipsed, which

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
they regarded as being
swallowed by a dragon,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:90%
they became hysterical.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.175 align:middle line:84%
The whole culture
just went nuts.

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would offer
human sacrifices.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:10%
They would bang
musical instruments.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
They would shout and just
rush around in a panic.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the
planet Venus, both

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Mesoamerica
and in Mesopotamia,

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
was regarded as responsible
for that eclipse.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It was the planet Venus,
as the dragon, that

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:90%
swallowed that sun-like object.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in Mesopotamia,
the ancient texts

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
just come right out and say
it is Ishtar's responsibility

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.648 align:middle line:90%
to cause the eclipse.

00:13:45.648 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
That means nothing
in today's astronomy

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
where Venus has absolutely
nothing to do with eclipses.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the ancient world
where Venus was a dragon,

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Venus did cause an
eclipse, that was

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.618 align:middle line:84%
the most terrifying event
with the destruction

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just a peaceful
event like nowadays.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:10%
An eclipse is a big nothing,
lasts for two seconds,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:10%
and has no sound associated with
it, has no disastrous effects.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The original eclipse,
prior to creation

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that is celebrated
in ancient myth,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
was a devastating, extraordinary
disaster that affected everyone

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It had terrifying sounds.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It had terrifying sights.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It lasted over the course
of weeks, if not years.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It was the primeval period
of darkness and chaos.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So it only stands to
reason that Venus,

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
since it was a
primary participant

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in those spectacular
events, that it

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
would come to have a part
of it as a evil reputation,

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.986 align:middle line:90%
as an object of fear.

00:14:55.986 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Greek mythology,
Venus has two lovers--

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Vulcan and Mars,
also known as Aries.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
With her lover Mars, she
gives birth to Phobos,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
the personification of fear
who accompanied his father

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:84%
into battle, and
his twin, Deimos,

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:90%
the personification of terror.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, today, we know
these are the moons of Mars.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But could this
mythological marriage

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
have been an inspiration
for our civilization?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In the ancient symbolism
attached to Venus,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
certainly one of the dominant
ideas is that Venus was always

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:84%
associated with marriages
and with love affairs.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So you find Venus being
invoked as the great uniter.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And that stems from her capacity
for bandying around the planet

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Mars and conjoining with
him in this sacred marriage

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
at the foundation
of ancient religion.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:10%
And so that manifests itself
not only in those Greek rituals

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:10%
of marriage that we were talking
about earlier where Aphrodite

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:10%
represents the bride and
Aries represents the groom,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:10%
but there is a
constant undercurrent

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:10%
that Venus is responsible
for sexual relations

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:10%
and is certainly
the love goddess.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So in a very real sense,
she's encircling, entrapping,

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:90%
tying up Mars.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we moderns
call it tying the knot,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:90%
that is not an accident.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
an ancient tradition

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
going back to the time
where Venus literally

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
tied a knot around
the planet Mars,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:84%
not only celebrating
the celestial marriage,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
but symbolizing
unions everywhere.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way
to visualize that

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
is the Egyptian Shen
sign where you have

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:90%
red orbs surrounded by a band.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact image
presented by Mars sitting

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
Venus where Venus

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
looks like a band
enclosing the planet Mars.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a single
marriage ritual

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
that anybody can name
that doesn't go back

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:90%
to this situation.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
So what does the bride
wear to the wedding?

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.532 align:middle line:90%
The big long train, right?

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:90%
What else do they have?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
They have a veil, right?

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Venus is always the veiled
planet on every astronomical

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
system around the planet.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> If Venus was a catalyst
for societal structures,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as ingrained fear
in the ancient people,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
how do we really know that
this was an electrical event

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:90%
in the sky?

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Where is the proof of Venus
as this wild comet that

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
marries this mythological
world with the reality

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.025 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system?

00:17:41.025 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There is historical
evidence that Venus was a comet

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
in reports of it developing
within historical times,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:90%
a visible cometary tail.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And this can happen, of course,
if the sun is undergoing

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
some sort of extra activity.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:10%
Now, particularly
in earlier times,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:10%
because Venus then would
have been discharging

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:10%
more strongly than
it is today, it's

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:10%
a case of the electrical
connection between the sun

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:10%
circle and Venus is through
these very diffuse plasmas,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.180 align:middle line:10%
which can have an unlimited
current carrying capability.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what determines the
time frame for establishing

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
a final stability.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Wal's theories about Venus
seem to coincide with a modern

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
observation.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
On January 12, 2005, NASA
launched a space probe

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:90%
called Deep Impact.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to study
the interior composition

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
of the comet Tempel
1 by releasing

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
an impactor into the comet.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But when it reached the comet,
something electrical happened.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In the year that the Deep
Impact mission was proposed

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and accepted, I predicted what
would be found at the time

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
of the spacecraft impact with
the comet, which was to happen,

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I think, about four years later.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And I predicted some
outrageous things.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I said that a comet,
as a charged object,

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.430 align:middle line:84%
will discharge to the incoming
copper metal projectile.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And it will strike
at a very high speed,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's no chance for
any slow glow discharge

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
or dark mode
discharge to equalize

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the voltage between the
impactor and the comet

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:90%
before hitting the comet.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So I said, under
these conditions,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.168 align:middle line:84%
the voltage difference
between the copper

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
projectile and the comet
will be quite different.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I expect there will be a
lightning flash between them

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:90%
before impact.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And when the experiment
finally was coming to fruition,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I listened to the command
tower, the broadcast from there.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was remarked
on there was a flash

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:90%
before the major outburst.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I said
also, in this prediction,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that the outburst
would be far more

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
powerful than anyone
expects because it

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:90%
will be largely electrical.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
With the comet ions splattered
all over one face of the comet,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
it would act like
a discharge center.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And the resulting flare out
would be much more powerful

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and expected.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, also, there will be
extra discharge points spring

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
up and other
discharge points will

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
move because of the change
in the electrical environment

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
of the comet, which
is very sudden.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
All of these things were
found to be borne out when

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.320 align:middle line:90%
the experiment was carried out.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.568 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was approached
by "Time" magazine

00:20:28.568 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to do an article on
it, because you'd

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:84%
expect that an outrageous
prediction like that,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
being shown to be correct, would
be front page news, at least

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:90%
in the science magazines.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I was in Los
Angeles at the time.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So I said, as soon as I get
back to Sydney, I am available.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got
back to Sydney,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:84%
somebody had peer
reviewed it and quashed it

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:90%
because it was impossible.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Impossible?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.916 align:middle line:84%
Or was more evidence
just coming to light?

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The Electric Universe
operates according

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
to the established peer-reviewed
literature on plasma cosmology.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And Hannes Alfvén, who is
the leader of all of this,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:10%
who actually drew the
circuit for the sun,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:10%
which would show that the
planets are orbiting within

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:10%
the sun's circuit.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, any object
within that circuit

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:10%
will also tend to exhibit
the same kind of connection,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:10%
that is, a polar connection and
an equatorial current shape.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Venus,
when I saw the Birkeland

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
current features of the hot spot
and the tornado at one pole,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
it was just simple to say, well,
the other part of the circuit

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
will be at the North
Pole, and so we should see

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same phenomenon.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was borne
out, of course.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Later, it was also shown
with the Cassini mission

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to Saturn, that it, too, had
this binary pattern at the pole

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:90%
rotating.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And that led me
to say that we'll

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
see the same feature
at the other pole which

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:90%
had been in darkness for years.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what was found.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to make accurate
predictions, quite outrageous

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
ones at times, once you have
the basic physical principles

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:90%
under control.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Another electrifying
discovery came when

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
the Magellan orbiter sent back
radar signals from the mountain

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.268 align:middle line:90%
tops of Venus.

00:22:26.268 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the mysteries that
the Magellan orbiter returned

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth was that its radar
signals were being returned

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.228 align:middle line:84%
very strongly from
mountaintops on Venus.

00:22:37.228 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And they call them
the shiny mountain

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:90%
tops in the radar images.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
There was no good
answer to that.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I saw it,
I recognized what it was.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:10%
When I said that Venus is
more electrically charged

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.113 align:middle line:10%
than the other planets in
the inner solar system,

00:22:52.113 --> 00:22:53.780 align:middle line:10%
one of the effects
of that is that there

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.415 align:middle line:10%
will be a tendency to try
and have a dark mode current.

00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:10%
There is on Earth, in
the Earth's atmosphere,

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:10%
there's a dark mote current
between the ionosphere

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:10%
and the earth.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
On Venus, that would
be accentuated.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in an electrical discharge
in the atmosphere

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
is that when the voltage
gets to a certain level,

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
sharp points and
high spots will begin

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to exhibit St.
Elmo's Fire, which

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of glow discharge.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a small current in
the atmosphere just normally,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
which can be measured because
of the voltage difference

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:90%
with height in the atmosphere.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But in St. Elmo's Fire,
that voltage difference

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is sufficient to cause the
atoms in the atmosphere to glow.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:90%
That glow is a plasma.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle line:84%
A dense plasma is a very good
reflector of radio waves.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And because the
mountaintops is where

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.282 align:middle line:84%
the discharge is occurring, they
will act like radar reflectors.

00:23:46.282 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they appeared
bright in the Magellan images.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Above a certain altitude,
they were all glowing.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Very simple answer.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
This has significance, too,
for the mythological references

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
to effects I've seen
on Earth, and that

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is that St. Elmo's Fire
danced along roof tops,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and the tops of
pyramids, and obelisks.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid, I think they
had a metallic cap or something

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
on top originally,
and that would

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.748 align:middle line:84%
have acted as a perfect
lightning conductor.

00:24:15.748 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Further evidence by the
team suggests that the ancient

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
people were affected
by this kind of phenom.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And they took
precautionary measures

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
with a famous device
recorded in the Bible.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Velikovsky, in his view,
his book "Worlds in Collision,"

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.430 align:middle line:10%
he talked about the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:10%
which he said was constructed
like a condenser and with

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:10%
collecting electrodes.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said that in the days
when there was this chaos,

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the atmospheric electricity
was much more active,

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're likely
to get electrocuted

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:90%
climbing up a mountain.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And a burning bush,
they burn forever,

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:84%
was St. Elmo's Fire,
because any filamentary

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
or any pointed object
will tend to appear

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
as if they're on fire.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant, he said,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
suggested was that as
the tribes of Israel

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
were moving around, if this
thing began discharging,

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
they realized they
were in danger.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So they would try and head to
somewhere lower ground, or flat

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
area, so that they're
less likely to be

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in direct line of
fire of any lightning.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:10%
But also, I think,
the Egyptian obelisks

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.150 align:middle line:10%
were also used as a kind
of similar weather gauge.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If they start
glowing at the top,

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:84%
you knew that you better lie low
and move away from high ground.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the birth of the
great goddess Venus have been

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the inspiration for
a new civilization?

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
As the ancient people adapted
to their new environment plagued

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
by disasters and a new heat
source from our current star,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:84%
could they have looked
to this monstrous comet

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and have seen beauty and
fear at the same time?

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Could Venus be named
our sister planet

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
because we have experienced
so much together?

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
If that is the case,
what about Mars?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
What role did Mars play
in the polar configuration

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and its connection to Earth?

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Up next, we explore
evidence of Mars

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and its electrical
interactions with our planet.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:90%
