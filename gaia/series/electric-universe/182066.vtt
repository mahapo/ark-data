00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> In December of 2013,
an article was published

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
in "Nature Neuroscience" that
discussed a new study that was

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.020 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how
memories can be passed down

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:84%
to later generations through
genetic switches that allow

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
offspring to inherit the
experience of the ancestor.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have long assumed
that experiences were built up

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
over a lifetime,
but this new study

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
suggests that fear could be
passed down from our most

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:90%
ancient ancestors.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
This interesting information
begs the question,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
how could our most
ancient ancestors

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
have implanted a thought
system we might use today?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Could there have been an
event in the past that

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
was so big, so terrifying,
that it would have altered

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
our DNA as a human species,
and that experience would

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
have forever changed
the experience of what

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:90%
it means to be human?

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.734 align:middle line:90%

In 2005, Wallace
Thornhill and Dave Talbott

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
published the book,
"Thunderbolts of the Gods."

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
This book explained a new theory
about our current universe.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They attempted to intertwine
the mythologies of the world

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
with the forgotten
science of cosmology.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Here, they presented evidence
of an electric universe,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
a universe that operated
by different principles

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900 align:middle line:84%
than are understood in our
mainstream science today.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
They believe that this
new theory explained

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
the massive damage that
happened to our ancient Earth

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and our solar system
approximately 10,000 years ago.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
According to their
work, this account

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in almost every
ancient text around the world.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
They weren't just mythologies,
they were real events.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Could this theory
explain an event so huge

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that it would have been
ingrained in our DNA?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:10%
>> My work looks at
the complete picture.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:10%
How did all of this begin?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:90%
What caused it to begin?

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
What did the ancients say
about the earlier period, which

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:90%
they called the Golden Age.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:10%
What was that all about?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of those questions
meant that there

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
was something going on
other than just gravity

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
operating in the solar system.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe says
that very simply, energy

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is a measure of the
motion of matter

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in relation to all the rest
of the matter in the universe.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there is
universal connectivity,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.738 align:middle line:84%
which is far different
from the model at present

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're presented
of the universe,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
of isolation by huge
distances and by time.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Cosmology has been described
as the queen of the sciences.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It is the intellectual
umbrella under which

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:90%
all other sciences sit.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Current big bang
cosmology doesn't

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:10%
fulfill that requirement.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It has no real connection to us
as individuals on this planet.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But what about the connection
between the mythologies on this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:90%
planet and cosmology?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Our research reconstructs
the history of the solar system.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:10%
Virtually every culture
around the globe

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:10%
preserve their own story
of the dragon combat.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So in Greece, it was
Zeus fighting Typhon.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Mesopotamia, it
was Marduk fighting Tiamat.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Rig Veda, it was
Indra fighting Vritra.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You can take these
traditions and distill out

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the common thematic
patterns in them

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and reconstruct the
history behind them.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> If there is a pattern
to be dissected by science

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and mythology that tell
a different story of how

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
the universe operates,
where do we begin?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Wall believes we should start
with the ancient recollection

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of an Earth bathed
in a different light.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The most ancient
recollections talk about

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:10%
the light being dim,
rather purplish,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.455 align:middle line:10%
and there being no seasons.

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So this meant the
Earth's situation

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos at that stage
was quite different to what

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:90%
it is now, orbiting the Sun.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
That took me decades
to figure out.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But having done it, it does
require that we understand

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:90%
stars for the first time.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And I say that because our
present story of how stars

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:10%
function and what
they actually are

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:10%
is based on a belief established
in 1920 by Eddington,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:10%
the astronomer, who felt that
the only way to have a star

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:10%
shine for millions of
years was for it to be

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:10%
powered by a nuclear energy.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we look at
stars as being isolated objects

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
in space at vast distances
from one another being fueled

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
internally, which is
like the old campfire

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:90%
in the sky of the Aboriginals.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just an updated version
of that ancient story.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is different.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
In modern times, when we
discovered electricity,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:84%
we found that we can generate
the power some distance away.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It can be hundreds or even
thousands of miles away,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and yet we can light a
home with electric lights.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It has not been considered
that stars are connected

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
electrically to the galaxy,
and that they trace the spiral

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
arms of a galaxy like
streetlights following

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
the power lines.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:10%
When you have that
situation, you

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:10%
don't have to have
nuclear energy lighting

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:10%
a star from inside.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.187 align:middle line:84%
This paints a whole different
picture of what a star is.

00:06:07.187 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And it also paints a
whole different picture

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
of what the various
types of stars

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
are, the red stars, the blue
stars, the white dwarfs, and so

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
They have to be then
explained electrically, which

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:90%
is a whole different ballgame.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Wall suggests this electrical
understanding of stars might

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
explain that Earth originally
could have orbited a different

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:90%
star than our current Sun.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
He was able to pinpoint
that at one time,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
the Earth might have
orbited a red dwarf.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancients said that there
was no seasons and there was no

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
rain, that water misted it
out of the atmosphere almost

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:90%
continually.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the ideal situation
for the carboniferous era,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
giant plants.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're found in the
Antarctic and the Arctic,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
the remains of these things.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The question was, how on
earth did they grow there?

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Red stars probably of
such a low temperature,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and their redness is
actually responsible

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
for this dim red
light, that we were

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
part of a red dwarf system
which was captured by the Sun.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:10%
The idea that life is
more likely to be found

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:10%
inside the red anode
glow, as it's called,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:10%
paints a different picture
to the situation on Earth.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
When you orbiting
inside a glowing sphere,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.412 align:middle line:84%
you receive the same energy over
every square inch of the body.

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
That means that the poles
are at the same temperature

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
as the equator, and
it doesn't matter

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
whether you're orbiting
fast, upside down,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
on your side, whatever, you'll
still receive the same energy.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So any other body in that same
environment will feel the same.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
The question then
arises, well, if we

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.238 align:middle line:84%
were partner to a red dwarf,
where's the red dwarf?

00:08:05.238 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer to
that electrically

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:90%
is easily answered too.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
On entry into the
Sun's environment,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that electric light
would switch off.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, because it's at
a lower voltage than the Sun,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:90%
it would turn into a comet.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The red dwarf deactivation
could be explained simply

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
by the difference of voltage
between European and American

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%
appliances.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
American appliances run at
110, while European appliances

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
run at 220.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
If you try to plug in
a high voltage item

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%

could fry your appliances,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
electrocute you, or
cause a power outage.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the red
dwarf, the Sun's voltage

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
was much stronger, and therefore
it caused a power outage

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in the red dwarf, which then
caused it to lose its ability

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to electrically keep Earth
and Mars orbiting its body.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the whole
system, when it broke down,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the red glowing light
would disappear.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
We would see the stars, and
we would see the universe

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could there
be more documented evidence

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of a new Sun witnessed
around the globe?

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most important
myths that we latched

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:10%
on to early on that has just
been generally overlooked

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:10%
by other scholars is that
the primeval Sun is described

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:10%
in terms that are impossible to
reconcile with the current Sun.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Mayan bible
is called the Popol Vuh,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and in that document,
they will describe

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
the origin of the first Sun.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And it says, when the
Sun first appeared,

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
it was fixed in the
sky like a mirror,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and they specifically
say that that Sun is not

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
the present Sun.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
If that tradition was
only found in Mesoamerica,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
you might overlook it.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But we have now tracked
down similar traditions

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt, ancient
Mesopotamia, ancient India,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
like in the Rig
Veda, they described

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.330 align:middle line:84%
as the Sun is sitting as a
stone in the middle of the sky,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
just like the Popol Vuh
describes their Sun.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, they're talking
about a different Sun

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
than our current Sun, because
the current Sun obviously

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
does not sit still, fixed
in the middle of the sky.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
In the Epic of Gilgamesh,
for example, there's

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
a very famous passage that says
that the Sun both rose and set

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
over the same
mountain, Mount Mashu.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the current
Sun can't both rise

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and set over the same mountain.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But in our theory, the Sun was
fixed in the sky over a world

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:84%
mountain, so it is certainly
possible for it to rise

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.770 align:middle line:90%
and set from the same place.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not
just a tradition

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
confined to the Gilgamesh
epic found already

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:90%
let's say, in 2000 BC.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very old tradition.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It'll be found all
around the world.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%

have electrically deactivated

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
our first Sun?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
If so, how would a new Sun have
affected life on planet Earth?

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And what would the
ancients have witnessed?

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other aspects
of being a satellite of a red

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
dwarf is that red dwarfs,
being an electrical object,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
have only one way of
dealing with changes

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
in their electrical environment,
and that is to eject matter.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
They flare.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is known--

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
astronomers have been
absolutely amazed

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:84%
at the fury of some of these
outbursts from red dwarfs.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now in the case of
our red dwarf star,

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
it, in encountering
the Sun's environment,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
would have had to
adjust suddenly

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to the Sun's environment.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
In the process, it
would have ejected

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:90%
material in large quantity.

We can actually identify
the possible bodies

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:10%
that were involved in all
of this by the axial tilt,

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:10%
because each spinning
planet acts like a gyro

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't like to be
disturbed from its pointing

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:10%
to the fixed stars.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.662 align:middle line:84%

or two of each other, which

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:10%

that they were associated

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:10%
in this former system.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Venus is the odd one out.

of material ejected from Saturn

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
as it deactivated would
have been the size of Venus,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is why it is the odd
one out in the solar system.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, piecing together
the ancient evidence,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that was the time when
Venus was actually ejected

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
from the interior of Saturn.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Venus would have no time to
lock its rotation to that

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
of its parent, and so
when it was ejected,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
it was also given a
slight backward kick, just

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
like two gears meshing.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And as a result today,
Venus is the only planet

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:10%
in the solar system which
is rotating backwards.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're an ancient person
looking up at the sky,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
what you are seeing is a
parade of planetary objects,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
which the ancients named,
and also named them as gods.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, man
felt totally powerless

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
in the face of all
of this activity that

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:90%
was going on in the sky.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:90%

to a fire breathing dragon.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was terrifying
to look at,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%

a lot of disasters,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
both in its immediate vicinity,
and raining towards the Earth.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.885 align:middle line:84%

terrifying situation.

And the planet Mars is
involved in the same events.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Mars was actually closer
to the Earth at the time,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's smaller
body than Venus.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
According to our
theory, Mars and Venus

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
participated in a very
unique configuration

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
polar configuration.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:10%
And so as the Earthlings looked
upwards to the North Pole,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:10%
they would see first | planet
Mars as a gigantic red orb,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:10%
and then behind it they
would see the planet Venus.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And as Venus started spiraling
out as a comet-like object,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.795 align:middle line:84%
it appeared to be a
dragon surrounding Mars.

Venus would litter the Earth

would eventually cool and look
green, while stones from Mars

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So the planet Mars
is always associated

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
with iron or the color red,
and so red-colored gems

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
traditionally will be
associated with the planet Mars,

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
like carnelian
stone, for example.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And turquoise will be
associated with Venus

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:90%
nine times out of 10.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So in Greek lore,
for example, you

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
have Aphrodite that's associated
with copper, greenish copper.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Throughout Mesoamerica,
here in America, the Mayan,

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the Aztecs essentially
worship turquoise stones,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and they associated
them with the planets

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and with objects
thrown from the sky.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And they make that very
specific in their rituals

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that the reason they
value these objects

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is because these are
stones thrown from the sky.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these colors and
symbols that we use today

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.980 align:middle line:84%
originate from this
disaster in the sky?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
If so, what else
did the ancients

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
experience on a ground
level that might be

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in some respects, terrifying?

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The electric universe
paints a different picture

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:90%
to the solar system.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:10%
And that is that
electricity plays

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:10%
a role when the planets are
not operating on stable orbits.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Now modern astronomy talks about
the magnetosphere of the Earth.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It is actually a plasmosphere,
because plasma behaves

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
in almost the fashion
of a living organism,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and it forms cell walls
between an object embedded

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:84%
in the plasma and the plasma
itself, the surrounding plasma.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Now in the solar
system, of course,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's magnetosphere
sits in the solar wind, which

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
is actually the solar plasma.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And when these plasma
spheres, if you like,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
which are much larger
than the planet touch,

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the electrical connection is
established between the two

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
objects, be they planets,
or even asteroids,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or comets, when
that happens, there

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is a direct connection
then between the two bodies

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that the plasma is such
that it is very diffuse.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
It's spaces has got very few
particles per cubic meter.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That means that
when it discharges,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't look like
normal lightning.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The ancients actually described
this interplanetary lightning

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:90%
as like a coal spat from a fire.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So this object travels
between the two bodies.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
It's known today from
modern plasma physics

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that that is called
a plasmoid, and it's

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
a very compact form of energy
transfer between two bodies.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But when it
approaches the Earth,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that begins to disintegrate
into colossal lightning bolts

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the like of which we
can hardly imagine,

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's enough to
sculpt the Earth.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What would these colossal
lightning bolts have looked

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:90%
like?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of ancient
imagery might depict this?

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There were tremendous
electromagnetic interactions

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:90%
between the respective planets.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so as terrestrial people
looked up the polar column,

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
they saw this giant cyclone-like
object rotating around,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
causing disasters on the Earth.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:10%
That was compared to a
giant single leg in the sky,

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.830 align:middle line:10%
And so our modern word hurricane
comes from the Mesoamerican

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:10%
word Hurakan, which was
the name of their main god,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:10%
their creator god, and he was
described as having one leg,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:10%
and that leg or the
gods supported heaven

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:10%
on his shoulders, kind
of like the Greek Atlas.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you get this image of
this one-legged, gigantic,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
hurricane-like
phenomenon that is just

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
wreaking havoc in the
northern circumpolar heavens.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that lightning, just
the ordinary sparks of Earthly

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
lightning today
make loud noises,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
but the noises from these
interplanetary thunderbolts

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
were sufficient to break the
sound barrier and actually make

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:84%
the Earth move, almost
as if it was a liquid,

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and then freeze once
the shock passed.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So it created the
strange formations,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
like the triangular
formations we

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
see on the mountain ranges
in the southwest of the US.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The ancient witnesses actually
saw these electrical events,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and they described the
changes in the landscape

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:10%
So we have good
physical evidence

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:10%
for what the ancients
were trying to tell us.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Canyon looks
like a minor, tributary

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:90%
of that colossal scar.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:10%
All of the features
of the Grand Canyon

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:10%
can be reproduced
in the laboratory

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:10%
by electric machining
electric arcing.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
stumpy tributaries

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.773 align:middle line:84%
with very steep walls, the lack
of any evidence of the outflow

00:22:13.773 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
of all the material that
must have been carved

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
from that canyon, because
in the electrical event,

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:90%
the material is shot into space.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Forget gravity when
electricity is in operation.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Gravity is a puny force.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It can excavate whole
mountain ranges into the space

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
without any effort
at all on its part.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>> How would the planets
Venus and Mars have looked

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to the ancients during
this interaction?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Venus was described as being
brighter than 10,000 Suns,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
which is the same phrase that
was used to describe the first

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%
atomic explosions.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The brilliance of the
object being so close

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and also with this
cometary display, which

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is an electrical phenomenon
as well, that bright cometary

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
style like appearance
is actually

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
an electrical discharge
on the surface

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of the body that's
approaching you.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of
electrical energy and the heat,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:84%
because Venus was a new planet,
that most of the activity

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.400 align:middle line:84%
took place between
Venus and Mars.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Mars was acting like a go
between between Venus and us.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the god of war
was so named Mars,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
because he was the
sort of intermediary,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and he fought the
demons, the monsters

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.697 align:middle line:90%
which Venus had unleashed.

00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is material
that had been shot into space

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.507 align:middle line:84%
and was now visible
as separate comets.

00:23:31.507 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If the ancients lived in
fear of these gods carving

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.540 align:middle line:84%
their Earth into pieces, how
would this event have formed

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the floods
recorded in ancient times?

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly, it would
disturb the rotation of both

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth's rotation
would have been affected,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and it would be fairly sudden.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:10%
That sudden change
in rotation would

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:10%
mean that the
Earth's oceans would

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:10%
tend to slosh over
the land, and so

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:10%
the stories of great floods
over lands, of course,

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.725 align:middle line:10%
these stories are universal.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The Australian Aborigines talk
about the ocean passing over

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
the northwest of the country
into the center of Australia

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
where we've got those
Great Salt lakes where

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
the ocean water dried out.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So the other aspect, of course,
would be intense earthquakes,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
because earthquakes also are an
electrical phenomenon, largely

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.697 align:middle line:90%
like underground lightning.

00:24:30.697 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
The Romans used to complain
about the noise of the Earth

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
groaning apparently.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:10%
So there would have
been colossal noise,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:10%
the sound of these
cosmic lightning

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:10%

If they were very distant,
sounded like giant trumpets.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can get an idea of where
the archangel trumpeting came

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is evidence of
a life-changing event that

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
happened because of an
electrical encounter

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, could
this explain the abundance

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of the creation myths?

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In the creation myth
in the Enuma Elis, Marduk,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the warrior hero, fights
against Tiamat the great dragon.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot of that battle
is after a tremendous struggle,

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Marduk slays Tiamat
and takes her body

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and forms the organized
world with it.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So her body comes to
form heaven and Earth.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
She is split in two
by the warrior hero.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And each of those
episodes will correspond

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to a real reconstructable
event in the history

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And so most people
just pay attention

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to that particular myth,
but the same exact myth

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
is told all around the planet.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So in the Rig Veda,
for example, you

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
have Indra splitting the dragon
Vritra and forming the cosmos.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament
refers to Yahweh

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:90%
destroying the dragon Leviathan.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If the myths of the world
describe a mass destruction

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and a new Sun that disturbed
their current reality,

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
how then did it shape the
psyche around the event?

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In the ancient myths
describing the planet Venus

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:10%
as a fire-breathing dragon, such
as the Egyptian myth of the eye

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:10%
of Horus, Venus is certainly
represented as a harbinger

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:10%
of destruction and a
catastrophic agent and raining

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:10%
fire from the sky,
raining giant meteorites,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:10%
bringing death and destruction,
according to the Egyptian

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:10%
texts.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:10%
So it stands to
reason that the planet

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:10%
Venus would get a negative
reputation in many

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient texts.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:10%
And so a classic example
of a negative Venus

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:10%
would be the Hindu
Kali goddess, where

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:10%
she has a distended tongue
and she has disheveled pitch

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:10%
black hair, and the hair
is sweeping away the Sun,

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.920 align:middle line:10%
causing eclipses,
causing disasters.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Kali is kind of like
a global archetype

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of the terrible or
negative goddess.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Could fear of the
unpredictable heavens have

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
caused the ancients to forget
their original past and only

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.355 align:middle line:84%
remember creation from
the moment of destruction?

They saw in the sky they
thought was the creation

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:10%
of the home of the gods.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about it,
every ancient race on Earth

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:90%
has their creation myth.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And the most
ancient remembrances

of what happened, these
creations in the sky,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
it shows you that
for any religion

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's talking about
the beginning of the universe

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:90%
is mistaken.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The creation myths are
talking about the creation

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.140 align:middle line:84%
of the present day
system of the planets.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was at the mercy of the
planetary gods, because they

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that were creating
this citadel in the sky.

of this universe they were now

indoctrined to, what would
they do with this fear?

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And how has that original
fear affected our thinking,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:90%
our society, and our DNA?

Jung were aware of this problem

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:10%
for mankind.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung said our greatest
danger is ourselves, because he

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.807 align:middle line:90%
understood man's symbols.

00:28:46.807 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
those symbols,

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:90%
it's strangely liberating.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem
facing mankind

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
is not remembering the past, and

Instead, we live it vicariously
by our doomsday movies,

our occasional warfares.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have this strange
destructive behavior,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
both towards the planet,
and towards each other.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It can only be addressed, I
think, by understanding that

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, to
achieve rationality,

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:84%
we must address this global
post-traumatic stress disorder
