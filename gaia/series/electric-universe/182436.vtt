>> On October 29, 2017, an
exhibit titled "Never Ending

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Stories" opened at the
Kunstmuseum in Wolfsburg,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Germany.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:10%
The art show attempted to trace
the idea of a loop structure

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:10%
through all mediums
and all cultures.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
This amazing show
gathered art pieces

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient
Egyptian serpent

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:10%

contemporary multimedia

interpretations.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:90%
It asks the question--

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
why was this structure
present in all aspects

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of human creativity since
the beginning of time?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Although that answer is
still up for interpretation,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
this series begs
the question, why

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
are circular structures
or loops also dictated

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
with dragons or serpents, and
why do some of these loops

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:84%
also depict crosses or
stars shapes in the center?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
What is it we desperately keep
trying to remind ourselves of,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and will this conclusion bring
us full circle to the truth?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Around the date 337 AD,
Romans embraced the concept

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity and celebrated
the birth of Jesus on the 25th

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:10%
of December.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But before Christianity and
even after its influences,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
another holiday was
widely celebrated

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
around the same time, and
it was called Saturnalia.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:10%
It fell on the 17th of December
and lasted for seven days.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This festival was dedicated
to the god Saturn,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
an agricultural deity that
reigned over the world

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:90%
in the golden age.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
This, according
to legend, is when

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
humans enjoyed the
bounty of the Earth

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
without labor in the
state of innocence.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
This festival was to represent
the freedom of humanity, where

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
slaves could be served by
their masters and women

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and men could dress and say
whatever they would like.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:90%
It was a time of liberation.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Even the statue of Saturn, at
his very own temple in Rome,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
was bound with wool
until the festival

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
when he was liberated for seven
days from the rules of society.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Could these ancient
people have been

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
carrying on an even
older tradition that

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
wanted to keep the
knowledge of the golden age

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
alive so that we wouldn't
forget that, at one time,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:90%
life was different on Earth?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And if this is true,
could this tradition

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
fall in line with the
electric universe theory

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that, at one time, we
orbited Saturn bathed

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in a red glow of innocence until
the day our new sun arrived

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to change the
format of our lives?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Proto-Saturn, as we call the
object which we described also

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
as a brown dwarf star, was
observed by people on Earth

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
as being a kind of
misty environment.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
There was no rain.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
The water accumulated
through a kind of mist

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because we were
actually orbiting

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in the very thin plasma
loaded with material

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
from the body of Proto-Saturn
so that the sky was largely

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:90%
obscured.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Also, that light
being red, it was very

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
conducive to photosynthesis.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
All of this
contributes to the idea

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
that we were living in a
totally different environment,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and the light was from
a different source

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:90%
than what we receive today.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It all fits with the idea that
this is a very good environment

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
for life, and that
has significance also

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
for this planet Mars because
it was in the same environment.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The ancients didn't seem
to be able to distinguish

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
other objects within this
glowing sphere because

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of the material that was
causing this mistiness

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
so-called golden age,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
the era of the Garden of Eden
and these kind of references

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in creation myths.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was regarded as
being a time when you didn't

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
have to struggle to survive.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
After the breakup of the
system, life was hard.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
People had to figure
out how to survive,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
how to actually
cultivate crops instead

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:90%
of just harvesting continually.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a time when flowers began
to appear-- colored flowers--

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
because, in the
earlier environment,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
flowering plants
were non-existent.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So all of these features
that have been uncovered

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
by the physical scientists
matches the record passed down

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:84%
through all of these
very ancient cultures.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancients themselves often
speculated about a relationship

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:10%
between Kronos as the planet
Saturn and chronos spelled with

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:10%
a C as meaning "time."

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, interestingly,
tends to be associated

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with enclosing bands, like
he's imagined to be imprisoned,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:90%
tied up in bands.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to notice
that the ancient mythical

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
beliefs associated
with the planets

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
continue down through history
for many thousands of years,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and they definitely influence
the development of sciences

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
like alchemy, certain
forms of magic, astrology.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite possible that,
even after the celebration

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of Saturnalia
faded from society,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
some people still wanted to
honor the original god of earth

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
at a golden age through
esoteric worship.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Cults that associate
themselves with Saturn

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
seem to go against
societal norms.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:10%
Ironically, many of
these esoteric signs

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:10%
used symbols that look similar
to electric interactions

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:10%
with plasma.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The theory suggests that
these images appeared

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
once the red glow had
disappeared from our planet

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and we were captured
by our current sun.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
These symbols would have marked
the beginning of a new era

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:90%
and the end of an older one.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the most exciting
discoveries of my lifetime was

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:10%
when I had a chance to
interact with Tony Peratt,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:10%
the Los Alamos physicist.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying
to figure out--

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
we know that the
cross in the middle

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is a conjunction
of Venus and Mars,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:90%
but what are they doing there?

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:10%
Once we got together
with Tony, he pointed out

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:10%
that these were
experimentally verified,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:10%
a part of plasma
science very well known

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:10%
called synchrotron radiation.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
If you consult Peratt's
published papers

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
on the subject, he will
show countless illustrations

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%
of this form.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind of a
dramatic confirmation

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
of the electricity
and plasma background

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of the polar configuration.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Both Tony and I were
impressed by the fact

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that one of the most ancient
symbols of the Maya people

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
displays this very
image, where there's

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
a four-fold star in
the middle of a circle.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And nestled in between each
one of those stellar rays

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
is one of these little
circles, so you just

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have a more
beautiful illustration

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
of physics in action recorded by
these prehistoric sky watchers.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And these four
streamers will show up

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
in countless places
in myth and symbolism.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So it will be like the four
rivers of the Garden of Eden,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:10%
It will be the four winds,
the four directions.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So ancient symbolism of the
kings around the globe--

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:90%
the early kings of Samaria--

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:84%
will always say, I rule from the
center of the four directions.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I control the four winds.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is the king
himself assuming

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:84%
the role of the great god
in Heaven, Mars, who's

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.075 align:middle line:84%
sitting there in the
center of these four winds.

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Another recurring symbol
that you will find everywhere

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
in prehistoric context
is the pentagram.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you look at
ancient Egyptian symbolism,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
for example, the symbol
for the underworld

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is a circle with a pentagram
inscribed in the center.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:10%
And the pentagram
traditionally will

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:10%
have-- it's a five pointed
star, and it will have

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:10%
a red orb in the middle of it.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you go to Mesoamerica
in prehistoric context as well,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
you will find the
exact same symbol,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
where it's a five-fold star.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally, the
five radiating streamers

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:84%
are whitish in color, but there
will be a red central core

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to that pentagram
in many instances.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we interpret that
as a slight variation

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
upon the Mars-Venus conjunction,
which frequently displays

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:90%
either four or eight streamers.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But during the
course of evolution,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it displayed quite a few
different radiating streamers.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:10%
And in many
instances, those were

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:10%
preserved by the ancient
artists for posterity.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If this demonstration is
a good example of ancient

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:84%
symbols, such as the cross,
the pentagram, the ankh,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and the wheel, how do these
plasma interactions possibly

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
explain our human fascination
with loops, serpents,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and dragons?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:10%
>> As Proto-Saturn got
further into the solar system,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:10%
it must have reached the point
where that instability became

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:10%
so great that it actually
ejected a fair proportion

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:10%
of its core material, which
would be heavy elements.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was witnessed
and described.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like the cosmic
egg references and also

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the encircling
serpent, the snake

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
biting his tail, the
Ouroboros imagery.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So certainly came an
orbiting object around

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
in the sky about
this central orb.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When Mars began discharging
strongly, Mars appeared,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
as it moved up the column,
to enter into battle with

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
the demons that were
surrounding Venus.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Venus appeared like a wildly
disheveled hairy creature.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
She was the archetype
of the Medusa,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:90%
the snake-headed goddess.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Because snakes, of
course, are a feature

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
of the mythology of the
time, serpents, the dragon,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.588 align:middle line:84%
the fire-breathing dragon,
which is an impossible creature,

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
witnessed in the sky

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and appeared fiery
simply because plasma

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:90%
is present in fire.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If the dragon was, in fact,
a comet-like object in the sky

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that mythologically swallowed
the sun, cause an eclipse,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
had feathers, had hair,
those ideas originated with

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:90%
experiences of watching the sky.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to do with biology.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There is no serpent
on the planet Earth

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:90%
that breathes fire.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:10%
There is no serpent on the
planet Earth that has a beard.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.725 align:middle line:84%
There is no serpent
that has any feathers.

00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the fire-breathing
dragon traces to this comet-like

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
object in the sky that
circled about the planet Mars

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and came to form the cosmos.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And so every motif associated
with the dragon, whether it's

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the fire-breathing part or
the guarding of the treasures

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
or the fight with
the warrior, he

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
will always trace
to the relationship

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:84%
between this enclosure
surrounding the planet Mars.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so these ideas of feathered
serpents and dragons--

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the whole mythology
surrounding dragons--

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
it would be possible to list
100 different motifs surrounding

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:84%
dragons like surrounding
the golden horde

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:90%
or protecting the horde--

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
have no reference
whatsoever to modern biology

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
or our understanding
of serpents.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:10%
It's strictly a
celestial phenomenon

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:10%
that influenced peoples
all around the globe,

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:10%
and so those
memories still exist.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Traditions are still
being told today,

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
many, many thousands
of years later.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The electric universe theory
allows you to look at so-called

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:10%
esoteric knowledge and try
and understand it in terms

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:10%
of the past history of the Earth
because, on looking at those,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:10%
a lot of them have their origins
in the symbology associated

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:10%
with all of the events of the
breakup of the Proto-Saturnian

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of years later,
these same symbols seem to be

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
incorporated in
our everyday lives.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But the team suggests, not only
do we have symbols ingrained

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
in our minds, but we are
surrounded by physical evidence

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of an electric universe.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:84%
On December 18, 2018,
in a remote area

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
over the Bering Sea,
a giant space rock

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
exploded above Earth's surface.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The energy it gave off was
more than 10 times the amount

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic bomb
detonated over Hiroshima.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:84%
The exploded space rock is
called by NASA a fireball.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
NASA recorded this
December fireball

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to be the second
most powerful one

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to enter Earth's
atmosphere in 30 years.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
How does this
fireball in the sky

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
lend itself to the
electric universe theory,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and where can we see
more evidence daily

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that an electric
force connects us all?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It's strange when you think
that the electric universe is

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.332 align:middle line:90%
manifest around us.

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:10%
Then, of course,
there's lightning,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:10%
which is more
powerful, and we can

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:10%
begin to understand
just slightly the effect

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:10%
of planetary thunderbolts
because they create

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:10%
both the noise, the
light, and the damage

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of the Earth,
particularly powerful lightning

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.430 align:middle line:10%
bolts that come from the
very tops of thunderstorms--

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:10%
the so-called superbolts,
which can blast trenches

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:10%
in the ground and
have been responsible

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:10%
for deaths on golf courses
and playing fields.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are just simple
things like discharges

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
with air ionizers and we've
all experienced the small wind

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.830 align:middle line:90%
that comes from them.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So electricity can be
responsible for generating

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
winds, and of
course, in the times

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of these disasters in the
past, some of those winds

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:90%
were overpowering.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
They were destructive
on a colossal scale,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were given names,
which are associated

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
with the dragon in
the sky, like typhoon,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and the dragon in
the sky was Typhon.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:10%
Then there is the
phenomena that have

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:10%
been discovered above lightning
storms, which were unsuspected.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Airline pilots reported these
flashes above thunderstorms

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
long before they were
accepted as being possible.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:90%
This is human nature.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We reject the things which don't
fit our map of how things work.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The initial response is
a knee-jerk one, which

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:90%
says, no, that's impossible.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So airline pilots were actually
afraid to report them for fear

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that it would impact
on their employment.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
These discharges
above thunderstorms,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
which are very fast and
hard to see and film

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
until high-speed
cameras in recent years,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
have been shown to be a series
of filaments that extend

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:90%
upwards to the ionosphere.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the ionosphere,
there are further phenomena

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
called ELVES, which are
huge circles of light,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:90%
which exist briefly.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And they can be up to
80 kilometers across.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They're very big.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
All of this is part of
the circuit which connects

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:90%
the Earth to the solar circuit.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So at the very outer
edges of the Earth,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
we have the magnetosphere,
and that connects the poles

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
along the magnetic field lines
where the current comes in

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to form the Aurora.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The Aurora feed electrical
current into the ionosphere,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and the ionosphere has
circulating currents

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, which effect
the Earth's magnetic field,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and they induce currents
in the Earth itself.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that the
circuitry of planets

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:90%
is quite complex.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The electric universe theory
suggests that stars are formed

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
on a circulatory system that
creates a series of stars

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
in the sky like street
lights or beads.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Where do we see this in
our terrestrial world?

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been observed in
powerful lightning bolts that

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the current pinches
off and forms a string

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
of beads, and it's
known as bead lightning.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.390 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
indications that perhaps this

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
is how stars are formed.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Then we have St. Elmo's fire
that is a glow discharge.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It's another lightning
discharge that is--

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
St. Elmo's fire is a slow
discharge from a pointed object

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
or a high point on a
building, a sharp edge.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
All of these things combined are
present experience of lightning

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and electrical activity
in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Part of the difficulty in
having people understand

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the electric universe is
that the word "plasma"

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
is very rarely used.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We live in one of those rare
environments in the universe

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
where, for most
of our experience,

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
everything is
electrically neutral.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we develop
static electricity

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.562 align:middle line:84%
and touch a doorknob and get a
shock from the electric charge

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
passing between us
and the doorknob

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that we experience in
electrical environment.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So it requires education
into the behavior of plasma

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
before the electric universe
can be fully understood.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
model suggests

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that particles are themselves
made up of smaller particles.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a repeated pattern
at different scales.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:10%
And all particles,
because they are composed

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:10%
of both positive
and negative charge,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:10%
can be distorted electrically
to form little dipoles.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Electric dipole is where
positive and negative charge

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is separated by
a small distance,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and the electric
field that comes

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
from that is more
like that of a magnet

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
than it is of a
point charged object.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was obvious to
suggest that magnetism,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
which is a dipole force,
has an electrical origin.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a little more outrageous
to suggest that gravity also

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is a dipole force because
it's almost a belief

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
firmly entrenched that
gravity is only attractive.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:10%
But saying that creates
a puzzle because nobody

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:10%
understands a force
which is only attractive.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It means there is no possibility
of balance in such a system,

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
so the gravitational model
of the universe is unbalanced

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and, as a result, you need
explosions and collisions

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and coalition of objects.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, there's no means of
separating objects and holding

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:90%
them in position steadily.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe,
therefore, said, OK, well,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.420 align:middle line:84%
if this is the case, then
the simplest answer to all

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of these problems is
to suggest that it's

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the response of all matter,
regardless of the scale,

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to an external electric force
to distort into a little dipole.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:10%
And in the case of
electric current,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:10%
where you've got free electrons
moving either along a wire

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:10%
or through space in
a Birkeland current,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:10%
the result of putting a force
in one direction on an object,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:10%
which is an orbiting
system, is to speed up

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:10%
the orbiting object in
one half of the orbit

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:10%
and slow it down on the other.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The result of that
is a transverse--

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that is, an ellipse at right
angles to the electric force.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the simple explanation
of the magnetic force

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
is the result of the dipole
distortion of electrons

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
subject to an electric
force in a current.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Magnetism is not
a separate force.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It is an electric force.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We apply the same principle
to the particles within

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
the nucleus of an
atom-- that is,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
the particles within the
proton and the neutron--

00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and say they are the same
structure on a smaller scale.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If we look at this
understanding of the planetary

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
system on a smaller scale,
how does this theory relate

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.365 align:middle line:90%
to our biological systems?

00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:10.965 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've got a magnet
with one pole on the outside

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and another one on the inside,
the two opposite poles are

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
separated, and inside that
body is the same force which is

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.155 align:middle line:90%
repelling everything.

00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And this raises the
issue about what

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
is the center of a star
or a planet actually like?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And the electric universe
raises the possibility

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that there may be
nothing inside.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:90%
We are a shell of material.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the electric
universe deals

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
with both ends of the scales
in our reality and both

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the particle physics on up
through the galactic scale,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
the question arises,
what significance

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
does this have for the
human condition, biology,

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and living systems?

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
It has profound
significance because it

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:84%
shows that the electric
force is the binding force.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:10%
It is the controlling
force in the universe,

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:10%
and it operates at every
level, from the particle

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:10%
up to the galactic.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
biological systems,

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
the complexity of the
biological systems

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
are controlled by signaling
between similar resonance

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
systems, which
means, for instance,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
certain molecules
of a particular kind

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:90%
will all resonate.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And because the signal
is the same as gravity,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
the direct electric forces
cannot be shielded--

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
it will pass
through all matter--

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
it means that the entire
body is a coherent system.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And it also is the
control system,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.268 align:middle line:84%
if you like, for all of
the trillions of reactions

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that are going on in the
body in any the instant.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It also is responsible for the
mind-body connection and some

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
of the strange phenomena that we
find in the natural therapies,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
where the heart seems
to hold memories--

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:90%
this kind of thing.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness
can be understood

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
as not entirely held
within the gray matter

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
but extends beyond the
body so we can then

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand the
significance of auras,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, energy centers
in the body, the fact

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that certain organs seem to have
far more significance than just

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
their pure biological
biochemistry and the sort

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of machine model of
our living systems.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe,
I think, provides

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the substrate, the basis, for
understanding life itself.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, what is the
difference between the electric

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:90%
force and the subtle force?

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it's good
to make a distinction here.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about what's
working at a particular scale,

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
at our scale, the signaling
is the same as gravity.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a subtle force.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It's one that no one has
been able to measure.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we seem to
know that it's there.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:10%
The phenomena that
have been discovered

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:10%
and the effects of
interference with that field

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.003 align:middle line:10%
have been tested, and
it's known that it works.

00:24:16.003 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that there has been

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.258 align:middle line:84%
no understanding of the physical
nature of what's going on.

00:24:21.258 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So the biological
field is a subtle thing.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
plasma interactions,

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:90%
which are electrical.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The electric force is far
more powerful than gravity,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and so electromagnetism
is far more

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
powerful than the signaling
system used in biology.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
However, it does raise the
issue that the actual activity

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
inside the cells in
the body is electrical.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So even though this
subtle signaling

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
can be a control
mechanism, it is

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
possible to understand that
electromagnetic radiation can

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
have effects that
are not expected

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and not understood in
the conventional sense.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the electric universe
theory explain the universe

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
outside of us as well as
the universities within?

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:10%
Could the symbols created
by electric interaction

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:10%
with plasma be symbols
of how our body responds

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:10%
to energy in a subtle way?

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> All of this relates to
the electric universe theory

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
in that everything is
connected by this subtle force,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
this dipole electric force,
which is like a daisy chain

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:84%

the origins of consciousness

It seems that the brain
itself is like a receiver.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Lipton put it in this way.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, you are like
a television receiver--

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that is, the physical you.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you die, then
the television station

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
hasn't stopped broadcasting.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you are no
longer receiving and responding

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to that signal.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
But he said we
are all, it seems,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
tuned to maybe the same
station, and as a result,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
we are programmed almost
from the point of conception.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And based on the DNA, the
template already exists.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The instructions
come from outside,

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.228 align:middle line:84%
and all that the DNA does
is respond to instructions.

00:26:19.228 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, how
do we change our DNA,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
our perspective, and our vision
for the future of humanity

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
by understanding the
electric universe theory?

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, understanding the
connectedness of all things

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and not the disconnectedness
of the present theory,

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
then we would feel
a part of something,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
a collective part of something
instead of feeling adversarial

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:51.077 align:middle line:84%
and disconnected and
pointless, hopeless.

00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of hopelessness today,

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
a lot of depression and
aimlessness in life.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, stems
from the beliefs that

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
have been encouraged
over the ages,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're all to be
judged and, in the end,

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:84%
those who believe the
right things will be OK

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and those who didn't will
be condemned to doomsday.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
All of this is archaic.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's nonsense.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
says everything

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is connected in a very intimate
way, which is not understood

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.807 align:middle line:90%
by biologists or anyone.

00:27:27.807 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
When you understand
the connectedness,

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
you realize that we're all in
this together and that even

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:84%
people who are disabled and seem
to be unable to function are

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
still connected to the
conscious universe,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that they've been somehow
disabled in a way that they

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:84%
cannot fulfill the dream that
they came to the Earth with.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I think this will
change our responses

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to all sorts of things which
confront us at present.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at all of
this as part of a pattern.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Life itself, I
think, is episodic.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The human body is
just a representation

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:90%
which lasts a certain time.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:84%
When it's gone, who
you are is not lost.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The universe remembers, and it
has phenomenal memory capacity.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:84%
That gives us a way of
looking at life, I think,

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:90%
which removes the differences.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
At present, the differences are
accentuated to such an extent

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that we believe that those
who don't fit our beliefs--

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
it's quite OK to
annihilate them.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And we see this happening all
the time around the world.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the electric
universe allows

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
us to think of new
ways of behaving.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to think
of collective behavior

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and our deep connection
with the Earth.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to talk about ourselves
as earthlings, children

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, instead of
talking about, oh, well,

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.920 align:middle line:84%
if we mess up this planet,
we can go and colonize

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.790 align:middle line:90%
another one.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
We will not be earthlings
any longer if we do so,

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and we do not know the
consequences of such actions.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
It's all science fiction
to talk about such things,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and the science
is archaic that is

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.406 align:middle line:90%
used to make these predictions.

00:29:14.406 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The electric
universe provides us

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
with ways of considering
how to produce energy,

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
how to actually live our
lives and treat ourselves.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Using the industrial processes
based on business principles

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:90%
is slowly destroying us.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Our medical systems are
based on a biology which

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what life is, and
yet the medical profession

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
are prepared to tell us
when we're going to die.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what death is.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:84%
People are afraid of
death because it seems

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.090 align:middle line:90%
to be the end of everything.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I see life as a continuum.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
only make sense

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:84%
if you have a science
underpinning it,

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
which allows for
this connectedness

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and this resonance
and this signaling

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
between people and systems,
the Earth and us, us

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.242 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> If the electric universe
does indeed paint a different

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
picture of our existence,
what do the symbols around you

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.748 align:middle line:90%
depict about your perspective?

00:30:25.748 --> 00:30:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you look to the sky,
how will that one fallen star

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:10%
connect you to the
force within us all?

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:48.619 align:middle line:90%
