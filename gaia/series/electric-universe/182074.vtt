00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In October of 2018,
"Quanta Magazine"

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
published an article titled
"Planets Found to be Larger

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Than the Disks They Come From."

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And it reads, "A
new research paper

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
suggests that planets
may be forming in ways

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:90%
beyond our understanding.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:84%
In system after
system, planets are

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
much larger than the
universe's biggest star.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
This seems to defy math,
or at least reason;

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
planets shouldn't be larger than
the stuff they're made from."

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
If this is the
case, could there be

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
a new theory that explains how
planetary bodies are formed?

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And could modern day
physics and astronomy

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
be running into problems
with the theories that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
have shaped our
understanding of the universe

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:90%
as we know it today?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Wilhelm Weber, best
remembered as the co-inventor

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of the first electromagnetic
telegraph, once wrote,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
"The history of the world is
none other than the progress

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of freedom."

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But what does
electromagnetism have

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
consciousness of freedom?

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In the late 18th
and 19th centuries,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
electricity and magnetism
were uppermost in most

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:90%
scientists' minds.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:10%
And there were some
key figures then--

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Gauss Maxwell, Weber,
and several others

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:10%
who put together what
we understand today

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:10%
about electricity and magnetism.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
It actually starts with
Wilhelm Weber's most important

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:10%
Wilhelm Weber was one of
Germany's top physicists

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the 19th century.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
He was a meticulous
experimenter.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he determined a lot
of the physical constants

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:10%
associated with
electromagnetism,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:10%
and the electromagnetic
unit was named after him.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:10%
What's not generally
known is that he produced

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:10%
an electric force law, which
was an extension of Coulomb's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:10%
electrostatic law.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Now Coulomb's law is
a very special case

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
where you have two
charged particles

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.388 align:middle line:90%
and they're not moving.

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
They're just in position and you
measure the force between them.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Wilhelm Weber said, what if
one particle is stationary

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and the other one is
moving at some angle,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
or even accelerating with
respect to this particle?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
He deduced a new
force law, which

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:84%
showed that these
particles behave

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
in ways which are very
important from the viewpoint

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:90%
of atomic theory.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he produced the
atomic model in the 1850s

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
before the atom
had been deduced,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:90%
how an atom was constructed.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Wilhelm Weber, with
his extended force law,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
showed that two charged
particles of the same sign

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
could actually, within
a particular radius,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.172 align:middle line:84%
achieve stable orbits
around one another.

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's not contemplated

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:90%
at all by scientists today.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It's always assumed that two
similarly charged particles

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
will always repel one
another to infinity.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Weber said that this wasn't
necessarily the case.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So this has implications
for nuclear theory

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and atomic theory.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It also has, strangely
enough, implications

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
for gravitational
theory, because

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in the electric
universe gravity is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
a form of dipole electric force,
which manifests just as if

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
planets are charged particles.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So that Weber's force laws
in the electric universe

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
become the mathematics
to be used in determining

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
planetary orbits.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>> If this is true, how could a
person understand Weber's force

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:10%
law versus Coulomb's law?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Coulomb's law
explains how strong

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the force will be between
two electrostatic charges.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Electrostatic means electric
charges without any motion.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Weber's force law
is quite different.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
All particles, regardless
of size and mass,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
follow Newton's third law,
which is for every action,

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
there is an equal and
opposite reaction.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, each particle
has conservation

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:90%
of particle momentum.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's put
it this way then.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And this allows people
to think about it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and go and test it maybe.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Very recently, there
was an experiment

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
done on the International
Space Station, which

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
showed the motion
of charged droplets

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
about a oppositely
charged needle.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a prime example
of an experiment that

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
could be used to test
Weber's force law,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:84%
because the particles
that go into orbit

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
are not stationary
as in Coulomb's law.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
They're moving with respect
to the central object,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're
accelerating as well.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And both of these aspects
of the orbiting particles

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
is taken into account only by
Weber's electric force law.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And it could also give us some
tests of the electric universe

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:90%
model of gravity in particular.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If Weber's law explained a
different universe operating

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
on electric force, how
did the science change?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Cosmology has been described
as the queen of the sciences.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
It was the intellectual
umbrella under which

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
all other sciences sit.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
sit comfortably.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The current big bang
cosmology doesn't

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
fulfill that requirement.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:10%
It has no real connection to us
as individuals on this planet.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It concerned mostly
with questions

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
about the distant universe,
and also about particle physics

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
questions, which have been badly
formulated, simply because it's

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
all based on mathematical
descriptive theory instead

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Wilhelm Weber had given
a physical explanation

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.695 align:middle line:84%
and he'd stated his
principles clearly.

00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:10%
James Clark Maxwell, in
the mid-19th century,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:10%
came up with his laws
of electromagnetism.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:10%
They're a little unwieldy,
and Oliver Heaviside should be

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:10%
mentioned as having been
the person who produced

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:10%
the condensed
mathematical formulae,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:10%
which are used today
and called Maxwell's.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:10%
Maxwell's had the question
though that was not

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:10%
answered later by the
modern physics approach.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is, what is
this material medium?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of pointed out
some of the characteristics.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It required the ability to
pass a force through matter

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
as if the matter wasn't there.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:10%
Maxwell took the
mathematical view

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:10%
that the field theory was
all that was necessary.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics is descriptive,
it's not explanatory.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the turning points

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in the history of science,
in my opinion, which

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.062 align:middle line:90%
is not generally recognized.

00:07:12.062 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
For mathematics,
it doesn't matter.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics can advance without
any reference to science

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
separate discipline.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But mathematics has
overtaken science.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like the workers
in the back room

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:90%
have taken over the business.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:10%
That is where I
believe, in my study,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:10%
that science left
the rails, and we

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:10%
have been heading
further and further

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:10%
into the wilderness since.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> If we indeed fell
further into the darkness

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of a descriptive science, as
the electric universe theory

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
suggests, what transpired next
that fed the destructive loop

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:90%
of our ancestors?

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me, looking
at the history of thinking,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the history of science, that at
the time of the First World War

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
was one of those times when
mankind was going slightly

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
crazy.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, try to repeat
the catastrophes of the past,

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:90%
as Velikovsky would have put it.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, there was
a disruption in our science.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Technology blazed ahead because
it always does at time of war

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
because technology
then is applied.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
There's an awful lot of
impetus towards application

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
of technology, and science
tends to hide behind technology

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you know, the
advances of technology

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:90%
are due to advances in science.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:90%
There've been very few advances.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I can't think
of any major advances

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
since the time of
Einstein and Niels Bohr,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and both of those people
were writing their theories

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
First World War.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So after the war,
we had surrealism

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
in science, introduced by
Einstein in particular.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
He torched our understanding
in physics of time and space.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.883 align:middle line:84%
He did all of this
using equations

00:09:06.883 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
where there were no
definitions for some

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental aspects
of those equations,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:90%
like energy and mass.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it plays into
this idea that we

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
have to adopt the power
of the gods ourselves,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:90%
behave with godlike power.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that became very
evident with the advent

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear weapons.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you can
see the two together then,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the Armageddon fear and
the destructive power

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:90%
of the gods in our own hands.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, how could
one of the greatest scientists

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
of our time have overlooked
discoveries from an earlier

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:90%
generation?

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not necessarily
anything to do with the science.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with
the personalities

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and the events of the day.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up with what's
known as settled science.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:10%
And I'm always reminded
of that photo taken back

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:10%
in the 1920s I
think it was, or it

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:10%
might have been early '30s, of
all of the great minds lined

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:10%
up, sitting on chairs
in the front rows,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and the others
serried behind them.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that as
being settled science.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it began.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:90%
But science is never settled.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
When the scientists
are puzzled--

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're perpetually
puzzled, I should say--

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
by the results
they get, they say,

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
it's back to the drawing board.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But what do they do
when they get there?

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:10%
They don't rub off
and start again,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:10%
which is what physics
is supposed to do.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're having a
problem with your results,

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
go back and look at the original
idea and then trace it forward

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and see where you've
made assumptions.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The electric universe
theory suggests there might be

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
a different explanation
for E equals mc squared.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Talking about the meaning
of E equals mc squared,

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:84%
there is no explanation at
present for E equals mc squared

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
in physical terms.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The electric universe
says that energy

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
is a measure of the
motion of matter

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
in relation to all the rest
of the matter in the universe.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there is
universal connectivity,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.190 align:middle line:84%
which is quite different
from the model at present

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that we've presented of
the universe of isolation

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
by huge distances and by
time, and the only connection

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:90%
is by the puny force of gravity.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
connected in real time

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:90%
by the direct electric force.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:36.055 align:middle line:84%
It is not mediated by any
force at the speed of light

00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing that
travels at the speed of light

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
is an electromagnetic
disturbance, not

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
the electric force.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a fundamental
error in modern science.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
As for mass,
philosophers have tried

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to explain mass for
centuries without success.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's still a mystery.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The result of that has
been that Higgs boson

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
has been invented, which is
a kind of cosmic treacle.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you try and move
against the treacle,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:90%
you feel resistance.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In the electric
universe, mass is

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
the response of matter
to the electric force

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
in the form of distortion
rather than acceleration.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And I say this because in
the electric universe model,

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
matter is a repeated pattern.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.945 align:middle line:84%
So that you have the atomic
model, which is very successful

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:26.677 align:middle line:84%
and when you've got
one successful model,

00:12:26.677 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to see
if you can repeat it

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:90%
at a different scale.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:10%
And if you do so, and
you say the electron

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:10%
and the proton
have structure just

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:10%
like little atomic systems,
then if you give it a poke

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:10%
electrically, it's
response will be

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:10%
to distort because the
charged particles will

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:10%
tend to rearrange themselves
into the ones that

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:10%
are orbiting into elliptical
orbits at right angles

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.727 align:middle line:10%
to the force.

00:12:52.727 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
the magnetic force.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic force is
always at right angles

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to the electric force.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason,
because matter,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
like electrons and protons,
have real structure.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So thus, energy and
mass are defined

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.445 align:middle line:84%
in the electric universe
simply, in electrical terms.

00:13:09.445 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Can electrical terms
explain the speed of light?

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The speed of light is an
electromagnetic disturbance

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:90%
in a medium.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So empty space is not empty,
it's full of a medium.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And the suggestion was
made by a scientist

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
back in the '70s,
which I've followed up

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and I believe is
correct, and that

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the universe is
full of these neutrinos,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
these particles that can
move through matter almost

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
as if it's not there.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:10%
It fulfills the requirements
that Maxwell had for his ether,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.893 align:middle line:10%
because Maxwell's
equations require a medium.

00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Einstein did away
with the medium,

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:84%
even though he
knew it was needed,

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and never explained how he could
do that and get away with it.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And now people accept
Einstein's version,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:90%
which physically cannot work.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So the electric
universe followed up,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to
make a lot of sense.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.728 align:middle line:10%
There's your speed of light
depends on the medium,

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:10%
and of course, we know
that light slows down when

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:10%
it goes through air and water.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
that those media

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
have different electrical
characteristics

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.815 align:middle line:90%
to the medium of space.

00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And that means also
that if the density

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
of the medium of space changes,
then the speed of light

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
will vary.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And this also means then that
around stars and galaxies where

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
the matter is more
concentrated, the speed of light

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
will vary in such a way as
to give you this, what they

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
call gravitational lensing.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not gravitational at all.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an effect of gravity upon
the medium that surrounds it,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
just like an atmosphere.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So it can bend light
like an atmosphere.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing to do with warp
space or any of that nonsense.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the
ether was effectively

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
done away with by Einstein
because his theory does not

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:90%
require an ether.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in fact, it's inimical to it.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:10%
Einstein himself said that if
an ether drift is discovered

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:10%
by Michelson and Morley in
their ether drift experiment,

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:10%
then his theory of
relativity is invalid.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:10%
It was an interesting
time because it

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:10%
would be a pressure on those
performing the experiment

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:10%
to not find the drift.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And in some respects, I
think that did happen.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
What was found was a drift which
was much less than expected.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:10%
>> In physics, ether is defined
as the existence of a medium,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:10%
a space-filling substance
or field of thought to be

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:10%
necessary as a transmission
medium for the propagation

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:10%
of electromagnetic or
gravitational forces.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think about it, the
atmosphere of the Earth is held

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth by gravity.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The ether, being
a material medium,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:90%
will suffer the same effect.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a
gravitational hold

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
on a certain amount of
this ether, which will then

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:90%
rotate with the Earth.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So that the drift
will not be what

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
would be expected if you
were traveling like a bullet

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
through the atmosphere.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you can detect
the rush of the air past you.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you're getting
this little drift.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was more or less
discarded as, I think,

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:90%
as experimental error.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1933, an American
physicist, Dayton Miller,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:10%
published a paper detailing
over 20 years of experimental

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:10%
research into the measurement
of the ether drift.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:10%
The results,
presented by Miller,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:10%
indicated the
existence of an ether.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Dayton Miller performed the
ether drift experiment more

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:10%
comprehensively at different
altitudes and different

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:10%
conditions, and he did
find an ether adrift.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
And he could even determine
the direction of this drift.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
he had canceled

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's contribution in
the theory of relativity.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
But no one wanted
to know, and so it

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
was discarded, discredited.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the usual kind of thing,
unfortunately, in science.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Science is not self-correcting,
as they advertise.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It's only self-correcting
in a trivial sense,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
small advances here and there
and small breakthroughs.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But big breakthroughs
require a revolution, what's

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:90%
known as a paradigm shift.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And revelations are very
hard to bring about.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So we've floundered
for a century

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
with a revolution in waiting,
the electric universe

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:90%
revolution.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If a paradigm
shift is needed,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.350 align:middle line:90%
were there signs of it early on?

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the odd things
that happened, I think,

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Einstein and Bohr
is that people who were arguing

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
very strongly against both
Einstein and Bohr's story

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:90%
of how things work were ignored.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't hear about them.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:90%
But if you go back--

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
students are not told to do

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
or are advised to
do, to compare ideas

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.285 align:middle line:84%
at the time of these sudden
switches in thinking.

00:18:29.285 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Because if you do, you go back
and you read the arguments

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:10%
against each of
these men, and you

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:10%
realize that there were
damn good arguments

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:10%
against the theories
of relativity

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:10%
and Bohr's quantum theory.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:90%
But it was just the times.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.157 align:middle line:10%
You really have to get
the historical context

00:18:46.157 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and the way people were
thinking at the time

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:10%
to understand the
progression of science.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it was
progression sideways,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:90%
off the track.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, once Einstein
was idolized as the greatest

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
genius of all time,
mathematicians

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
began to see this as
a great opportunity.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they then
came up with the idea

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.833 align:middle line:84%
that mathematics is the way
to understand the universe.

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If you do physics, most of it
is a hard slog in mathematics.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about
the physical objects,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
the electrons and the protons,
and the so-called neutrons.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They deal with the
mathematics involved.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:10%
And the mathematics
can only describe

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:10%
what these things are doing,
what these particles are doing,

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:10%
what the Earth is doing
moving around the sun, what

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:10%
the moon is doing
moving around the Earth.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a description only.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not an explanation.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So when people also assumed
that the Big Bang theory was

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the correct way to go,
what they didn't point out

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
is that it is an
almost exact replica

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
in the beginning,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and let there be
light and so on.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.235 align:middle line:84%
It was the scientists'
version of Genesis.

00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at the
earliest cosmologists,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:10%
like the ancient
Greeks for example,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:10%
their cosmology was describing
the creation that we're talking

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:10%
about, not the cosmology that
modern science are talking

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:10%
about.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Modern science is
fixated on this Big Bang

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
idea of the origin of
all things or the origin

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of the universe countless
billions of years ago.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
That isn't what the
ancient cosmologists

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:90%
were talking about.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
about the creation

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of the polar configuration
that we're talking about.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And so for example, one of
the earliest Pythagorean

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:10%
cosmologists was a
guy named Philolaus.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And he believed that fire was
at the center of the universe.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it resided in the middle
of heaven in a giant hearth.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns
out, that's just

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the
ancient Mayans believed,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:84%
the ancient people
of India believed.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that is a
old-fashioned idea from myth

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and ancient religion
that became incorporated

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:90%
into the early cosmologies.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the early
cosmologies were all about.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
They were handed down,
mythical traditions

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that have nothing to do
with trying to explain

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:90%
the origin of things.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But they're talking
about a specific event

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:90%
in history called creation.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So much of modern cosmology
is just a house of mirrors.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Instead of paying attention
to what the ancient peoples

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
actually said about
creation, they

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
want to speculate about events
countless billions of years

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:84%
ago, and they want to run
endless computer simulations

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
showing planets on the
same orbit as today

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
rather than go back and look
at the ancient documents that

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that the planets were

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:90%
on different orbits.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And so from a very
real standpoint,

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
the ancient cosmologies
and the ancient myths

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
give the lie to this
modern cosmology that

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:90%
dominates science nowadays.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
But that's really the
position we're in now.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get
these guys to look

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient pictographs
that show a different sun, that

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:90%
show an impossible sun.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to get them to look
at the ancient documents that

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
describe the planet Venus moving
as a comet, the planet Mars

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
raining disaster right
over the North Pole.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And we are confident that
our evidence is correct

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and that we'll be vindicated
at some point in time.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If the history of the world
and the idea of creation has

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
stifled our freedom
and consciousness,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:90%
could there be more proof?

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:10%
In 1970, electrical engineer and
plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:10%
accepted the Nobel Peace
Prize for his work in magnetic

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:10%
hydrodynamics.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:10%
His speech, however,
had a familiar tone

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:10%
of unprogressive science.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Hannes Alfvén received his
Nobel Prize in 1970 and warned

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:10%
astrophysicists that they
were heading for a crisis

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.810 align:middle line:10%
because they were dealing with
equations which did not apply

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:10%
to the very plasma they
were trying to understand.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:10%
Yet he made that statement
in his Nobel Prize acceptance

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:10%
speech, which is almost unheard
of, where he admitted that he

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:10%
had made a mistake
in his earlier work,

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:10%
but astrophysicists still cling
to that earlier work of his

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:10%
and treat plasma
as a kind of a gas.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Gravity works towards a
center, not along a line.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to draw
material into a thin filament.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
What's more, these
filaments of constant width

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
are over huge distances,
hundreds of light years

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
light years even.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they connect with
other filaments in the same way

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
as we see in electrical
laboratories.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking
at is cosmic lightning

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:90%
in a molecular cloud.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what's
been observed

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was a huge puzzle
when it was first observed.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually
predicted by Hannes Alfvén,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.505 align:middle line:84%
the father of what's
known as plasma cosmology,

00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:29.305 align:middle line:90%
decades before.

00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And as this material
becomes heavier,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the lightning bolt moves on and
leaves all this heavy material

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in a string, which then
gravity takes over,

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:90%
as Hannes Alfvén said.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The celestial system
stars are the results

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of gravity taking over after
the electric forces moved on.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have stars
forming, solid objects.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So stars do not have
hydrogen in their centers.

>> Could this discovery
prove how stars are formed?

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible Hannes
Alfvén's work on plasma

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:84%
disrupted the status quo so much
that it couldn't possibly fit

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
into the narrative of
destruction that humans had

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:90%
designed thousands of years ago?

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Could Hannes Alfvén's work be
the key to understanding how

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:84%
the universe was formed
and how it operates?

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
We dive deeper into the creation
of the stars themselves next.
