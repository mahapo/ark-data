hidden, more esoteric,

deeper meaning to
the Hollywood films

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:90%
that we all love to watch?

I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: In Ridley
Scott's "Blade Runner,"

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
we have the warning of a
completely synthetic future,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:10%
something that's completely
overwritten normal reality.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
LA traffic is still
bad 20 years from now.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Giant ziggurats
towering over the entire city

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
with one corporation that runs
it all, the Tyrell Corporation.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:90%
And what are they obsessed with?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
and human engineering.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So this film is
really an amazing exploration

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when an
artificial creature, Deckard,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:90%
begins to realize that he is--

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.935 align:middle line:84%
begins to become
self-aware, self-conscious.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is actually what

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
the film is about, is Deckard's
coming from the matrix of being

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
artificial
intelligence and Batty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
initiating him and leading
him in to individuality,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
which he achieves by
the end of the film.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.524 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I like that you
mentioned initiation,

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
because I see the opening
sequence with that ziggurat--

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.156 align:middle line:84%
and then we flash
to Deckard's eye.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we're having
a giant pyramid with an eye,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so we know
that, from the outset,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
this is, in some way, Masonic
or an initiatory-type experience

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that we the viewer, as well
as Deckard the replicant,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to undergo
throughout the film.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.745 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And the whole film--

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
the replicants have
a disgust for humans.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And they
really have come

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we're
actually not useful at all.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And they are superhuman.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
The one replicant sticks his
hands in the frozen liquid

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and is unhurt by it.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But they've been given a
time limit to their lives,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:84%
which they consider to
be extremely unfair.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
Deckard has a time limit.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't appear.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the
blade runners are

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.075 align:middle line:84%
replicants that are not given
a time limit to their death.

00:02:24.075 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I like that you
mentioned time limits

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and death, because
really, the modus operandi

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
of the corporate
scientistic establishment

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:90%
is to overcome death.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole goal
of trans-humanism.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And the way that that's
perceived to be done

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is through merging with
AI and with computers.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what's neat
about this presentation

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is that it flips
the script a bit.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And it says, what if the
replicants themselves

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
realized that they need to
rebel against their creators?

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Us.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So I read it on multiple levels.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I see it as kind of
a Masonic allegory.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.384 align:middle line:84%
But I also see it as, in a
way, describing the real world.

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the
real world, we deal

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
with these oligarchs,
these corporate elite

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about before,
who see us as basically

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
their scientific test tubes.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.245 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:14.195 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking
at in the opening scene

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is basically the hell of a
totally corporate-controlled LA

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:90%
future.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Total dystopia, worst version.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice
how globalist it

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.016 align:middle line:84%
is, because you see these
giant, sensory overload

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
display screens everywhere.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
Times Square on acid,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
with everywhere it's
Japanese, it's Chinese.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's all these cultures
blended, smashed together,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
all run by this giant
pyramid corporation.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The place to be
in this dystopian future

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:90%
is off world.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.646 align:middle line:84%
And they present the
off world like it's

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
a kind of heaven
that you can win,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
something like the island
from Michael Bay or something.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But what's funny too
is that this is 1982,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and the film includes
nanotechnology.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You have the sequence where
we're going to see nanotech.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
level of the presaging

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
or the predictive programming
that's telling us what--

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.624 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody in 1982
knew about nanotechnology.

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I don't think so.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.705 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: In the public.

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:18.163 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, in the public
eye, I don't think they did.

00:04:18.163 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, more secrets
being released,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
amazing vision of the
future in "Blade Runner."

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.992 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we know the
sequel will be coming out.

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And I can't wait to see that.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So here we have classic
Masonic imagery, as well as

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Bohemian Grove imagery,
this owl, right?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's a synthetic owl.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But the owl is the
principle of wisdom.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It's Minerva, Order of Minerva,
according to the Illuminati,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
historically speaking.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It must be expensive.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: My thesis on
this is that the highest

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
level of scientism,
or scientific progress

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
has achieved anything
that it conceived of.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really what
the history of, in my view,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
the secret societies are about
was not so much the mastering

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of occult arts per se, but
what those occult arts could

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
do in the real world in terms
of technology and science.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this presentation,
what I think you have is

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Deckard here is going to
be amazed at the ability

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that Tyrell has to
mimic the real world.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this to be
an empathy test?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Capillary dilation of
so-called blush response,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
fluctuation of the pupil,
involuntary dilation

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
of the iris.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And so
it's almost like--

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:10%
if you've read the
philosopher Jean Baudrillard,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:10%
he talks about the
synthetic overlay

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:10%
that would come in the future,
where almost everything would

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:10%
be synthetic.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:10%
And it would be
impossible to tell

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.622 align:middle line:10%
what was fake, what was real.

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was writing this
before "The Matrix" came out.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It's even referenced in
the film, "The Matrix."

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like,
here's the reality

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.299 align:middle line:84%
of total virtual
reality made real.

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, I
totally agree with that.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I find it very interesting
that when Tyrell first

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
enters the movie, he begins
talking about eye responses

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and pulse rates
increasing and things,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
almost implying that he knows
Deckard also is an android

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and that he can be tested too.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't just talking
about Sean Young's character,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
but both of them, I think.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, these
psychological profiles,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.234 align:middle line:84%
what they call the
Voight-Kampff Test, to me,

00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of a
lot of the literature

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that you would read about
the MK Ultra program.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
all of this testing

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that was done on many levels.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It involved drugs.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It involved a psychiatrist,
sociologist, Dr. Ewen Cameron

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and Jose Delgado.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were all concerned
with mind control.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So what's funny is
that you think at first

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
that this is about creating
programmed assassins.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what these Nexus 6 are.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that
they break their programming.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
they actually want

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to move on and take-- they
want to inherit the future.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They want to become the
future and not humanity.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
Batty shows that there

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
are parts of the human
experience that he

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
does admire through the Blake
poem and things like that.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But he knows in the
end, the future is his,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:90%
whether he's here or not.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what's
really going on here.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the whole
sequence with the owl

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting, because not
only does it represented Molach

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, but in
the intelligence circles,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
they have two words for
different types of agents.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
One is an owl, and
one is a rooster.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
A rooster is someone who
wants to wake someone up.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And owl is someone who
wants to keep people asleep.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
you see in this movie

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
is a war between the
owls and the roosters.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Batty is the rooster,
and Tyrell is the owl.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And he even has an owl in
his office to make sure

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%
that everybody knows it.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.141 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Good point, yeah.

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.416 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget that Gaff
leaves the origami rooster,

00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.415 align:middle line:84%
like you said, as part
of the trail that Deckard

00:08:08.415 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to pick up.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.331 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Next, we're
going to look at "fiery

00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:14.113 align:middle line:90%
the angels fell."

00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Fiery the angels fell.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Deep thunder rolled
around their shores,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.186 align:middle line:90%
burning with the fires of Orc.

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
You not come here.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Illegal!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: This is interesting,
because this poem is

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:90%
about the American Revolution.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
It's about overthrowing
King George.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back to Francis
Bacon, the mythology of America

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:90%
is as the new Atlantis.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
Blake is saying,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.379 align:middle line:84%
this continent will give rise
to, or be the next Atlantis.

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be revolutionary.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
overthrow the king.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And so Roy Batty, I think, is
consciously referencing that,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
saying that he
and his replicants

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
are like the newest, latest
band of revolutionaries.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.965 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the introduction
to "Brave New World," Aldous

00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Huxley says that all of
the revolutions, which

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
were scientific
revolutions, he says,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
this is the final one
in "Brave New World."

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is the revolution
to transcend humanity.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I do think you're
right about Blake and Francis

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Bacon and the origins of
America and that Batty obviously

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
thinks he's one of
these revolutionaries.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly, right.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that poem is consciously
full of Masonic imagery

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
or esoteric or
hermetic symbolism,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:90%
as many of Blake's works are.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.144 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so
that's purposely why

00:09:41.144 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:90%
it's included in the script.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And so what's, again, depicted
as a very dark future, a very

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:84%
dystopian future,
is again a warning.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Just like in "Alien" you have
the warning of Weyland-Yutani

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Corporation, here, you have the
warning of Tyrell Corporation.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a question of, will
we find our humanity again?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer is
that the way that we're

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
going to find our humanity,
according to "Blade Runner"

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is through those future
machines, who are going

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:90%
to turn into a semi-human.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what's going on
with Batty and with Deckard.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
They're actually becoming more
human, more self-realized,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
more understanding of
themselves as an individual.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
the initiatic process

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
in spiritual traditions is.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I think when you grow up in
a tribal kind of situation,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
you begin thinking
in an odd way.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:84%
There's this psychiatrist,
Julian Jaynes,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a whole book about the
bicameral mind and "The Iliad"

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and "The Odyssey" and how in
"The Iliad," all of the people

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
that are in there--

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Ulysses and all the other
characters fighting the war--

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
they are being directed
by other worldly voices

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire thing.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Gods are telling
them what to do.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
what the gods say.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But in "The Odyssey,"
Ulysses, or Odysseus,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
think for himself.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
He's beginning to make
the decisions himself.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey"
is really the literary idea

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
of this moving from
a group consciousness

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.594 align:middle line:90%
to an individual consciousness.

00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's going on

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in "Blade Runner,"
Batty first, and then

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
through the initiation--

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.663 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Awakening Deckard.

00:11:25.663 --> 00:11:26.706 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --now Deckard.

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So if we
think about Eye World,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
this is neat because
this, as we said,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
is a Philip K. Dick story.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And Eye World comes up
again, or the notion

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of having to replace
your eyes comes up again

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.289 align:middle line:84%
in "Minority Report,"
because in the future,

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the idea is, where there's
going to be retinal scanning

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.996 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, you're
not going to be

00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:90%
able to hide from the system.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So what Eye World
is is this place

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
where you can go, presumably,
and have a new eye put in

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to thereby bypass
the retinal scanning.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And Roy Batty's there
because the Asian guy

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:84%
who runs it is one of the
engineers of the replicants.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he thinks this guy's
going to be able to tell him

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
how can he get back to Tyrell,
how can he take them down,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.591 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
he's the scientist that makes

00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:90%
the eyes for the replicates.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the famous
line of Roy Batty--

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
"If you could see what
I've seen with your eyes."

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:90%
And a great scene.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, the eyes are
the window into the soul

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and into the pineal gland.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're a very important
organ of the human.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the
way towards light

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.515 align:middle line:84%
and how light comes in
and out of our system.

00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, you
mentioned technocrat.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that this
film consistently shows eyes

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
is that it's not just

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the all-seeing eye symbolism
per se, but the meaning

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:84%
of the all-seeing eye
is total awareness.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:10%
Or what the technocratic
establishment

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:10%
would like to have is
total panopticism, which

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.776 align:middle line:10%
is the idea that
everything is surveilled,

00:13:02.776 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:10%
everything is
watched, everything

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:10%
is known, total gnosis, which
will give you the upper hand.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So Tyrell is, in
many ways, not just

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
creating AI
presumably because he

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
lives atop this giant pyramid.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
He's also involved
in panopticism.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.399 align:middle line:84%
Next we're going to look at the
notion of implanted memories.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You remember the spider
that lived in a bush outside

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
your window?

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Orange body, green legs.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
You watched her build
a web all summer.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.495 align:middle line:84%
And one day, there's
a big egg in it.

00:13:37.495 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
The egg hatched.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.435 align:middle line:90%
>> The egg hatched.

00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.205 align:middle line:84%
>> And 100 baby
spiders came out.

00:13:46.205 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And they ate her.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So here we have
Deckard explaining that she

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.865 align:middle line:90%
has implanted memories.

00:13:53.865 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And this has been the
key throughout the film

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:84%
to let us know who
the replicants are.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The back story that you have,
the memories of who you are,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:90%
were created by Tyrell.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And they're just copies.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And all the replicants
have the same backstory.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.166 align:middle line:90%
Bad joke.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
I made a bad joke.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:90%
You're not a replicant.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:90%
No, really.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.352 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.352 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And what
we're going to see

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:84%
is that Deckard realizes that
he has the same memories too.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I find
fascinating about

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
this is that if you look to the
real history of the MK Ultra

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
program, they were actually
studying human psychology so

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that it could transition, as
we said, into Fort Detrick

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.305 align:middle line:90%
and into DARPA.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It actually turns into
DARPA, believe or not.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the origins of
the MK Ultra program.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, Ewen Cameron
was an MK Ultra scientist

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:90%
out of Montreal.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And he would use what he
called psychic driving, which

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
he would repeat the same thing
over and over and over, which

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.372 align:middle line:84%
was burying an
implant into you so

00:15:00.372 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that you would begin believing
what you were hearing.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Extremely
frightening process.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That's why I see this
operating on multiple levels

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.897 align:middle line:84%
because you can look at
studies that DARPA does now

00:15:10.897 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that are public,
where they talk about

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that they do have the
ability to implant

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:90%
false memories in people.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is, again,
Philip K. Dick, who hung out

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in the Silicon
Valley circles, he

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:84%
knew about what
was really going on

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
in the military-industrial
complex.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Silicon Valley
circles are actually

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:90%
connected to MK Ultra as well.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not two different things.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting a revelation
not of just Masonic allegory

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and mythology and
initiation, but also

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of what the
deep state was up to.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it was
incredibly interesting

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:90%
when you think about it.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Here we have Ridley
Scott in 1982

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:10%
making a movie about all these
themes of high technology,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:10%
possibly clones, and doing it
in a very humanitarian way.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why I like
this film so much is that you

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
actually begin to feel
for the replicants

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the film.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And they've become almost the
victims of the corporate state.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.789 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Many people
considered "Blade Runner"

00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
to be best lit film, a
shot film, you might say,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
for that in that

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
right before he had
lined up all the cast,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Ridley had, and he lined
up the crew and everything.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And then right at the last
minute came the strike.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in 1981.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he had three months with
his crew who he was paying.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:90%
But they weren't doing anything.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.927 align:middle line:84%
And so Scott said, I'm not going
to pay you not to do anything.

00:16:37.927 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So he called the
entire crew together.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to make the
best lit movie of all time.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
We've got three months
to design the lighting.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think then he brought
in Vangelis, the composer, who

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
created that film noir,
electronic future soundtrack.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that, combined with
Sean Young's strange haircut

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
created this kind of
reinvigorating film

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:90%
noir through science fiction.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Another staple of
noir is the Venetian blinds.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And you see that with
the smoke, the smoky air,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.486 align:middle line:84%
and the very dim lighting coming
through the Venetian blinds.

00:17:13.486 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
You see that in "Chinatown"
at the very beginning,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.429 align:middle line:90%
another neo-noir film.

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Next we're going to look
at the nanotech serpent.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.454 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Fish?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
[MAN SHOUTING IN BACKGROUND]

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was
manufactured locally.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.781 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
[? Time ?] is quality,
superior workmanship.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:18:03.278 align:middle line:84%
There is the maker serial
number 9906947XB71.

00:18:03.278 --> 00:18:05.768 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:09.494 align:middle line:90%
Not fish, neck scale.

00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:11.326 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a snake.

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:13.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Try Abdul Ben-Hassan.

00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:90%
He made this snake.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So Deckard is looking
for his first replicant.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And he finds out that
she is a stripper.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And she has a giant
boa constrictor

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
that she strips with.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So here we have some
Eden imagery here

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
with the nude woman
and the serpent.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And what he finds
is that this is not

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
a real serpent, which is a
clue that this is a replicant.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So he takes this scale from the
boa constrictor to be analyzed.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.135 align:middle line:84%
And it has this little
nanotech serial number on it.

00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Watermark.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So I see this as, again,
amazing predictive programming.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Impressions here with
Philip K. Dick or Ridley

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Scott, whoever put
this aspect into it,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the possibility
of nanotechnology.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've
looked at, the earliest

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that I could find of
references to nanotechnology

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:90%
would be 1986.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I think supposedly IBM
was able to arrange atoms,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
they claim, into a certain
letter configuration.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is 1982,
projecting the possibility

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.155 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with things
at such a micro-level.

00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
it's interesting

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
because in the early '80s,
around the same time period,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Jim Keith put out his first
book "Secrets and Suppressed."

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And at the very
beginning of the book,

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:10%
he has a picture of
a nanochip, which

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:10%
was found at Oxford University
during an experiment

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:10%
on someone.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And literally, the
picture has the chip.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And underneath it, it says,
do you know what this is?

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.139 align:middle line:90%
Please call.

00:19:50.139 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
know what it was.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, that would be about '79--

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Oh, wow.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --that
this chip was found.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.275 align:middle line:84%
And that's the earliest
I've ever seen.

00:19:57.275 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, what does Ridley
Scott and Philip K. Dick know?

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Philip K. Dick was still around.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
He died during the
filming of "Blade Runner,"

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:90%
but he was around.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And what did he
really know about what

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:90%
was going on in Silicon Valley?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So what they're
doing in Eye World is

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.805 align:middle line:84%
they're-- we're focusing
back on the eye.

00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the
"Blade Runner" series,

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:84%
the focus is on the eye because
that's the most obvious way

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:90%
to identify someone.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
That is the trait by which
you could, in this dystopian

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:84%
future, identify and name
who or what something is.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so we find
out at the beginning

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:36.068 align:middle line:84%
that when they're doing
the Voight-Kampff Test,

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at
the way the eye reacts

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to the questions that
are asked in that test.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this is going to tell
who is and who is not a human.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it also, as we said,
has that initiatory occult

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
significance when
it comes to the fact

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that the real eye in
this movie is Tyrell.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But Tyrell is going
to be taken down.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to be
replaced with the future,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.285 align:middle line:84%
the future of humanity,
which is trans-humanity.

00:21:01.285 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I also
point out that Tyrell

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
has extremely thick glasses,
which causes his eyes to become

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.575 align:middle line:84%
even bigger when he's on camera,
which is deliciously hilarious.

00:21:10.575 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, it's
irony because he's

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
creating these beings
that have the ability

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:90%
to presumably see perfectly.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And he himself cannot see.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And so because Roy Batty
is this Luciferian rebel

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
against his creator, the
gnostic mythology of rebelling

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
against the demiurge.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The demiurge is
always characterized

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
as this sort of dumb, arrogant,
stupid thing or entity,

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because he created these beings,
and they're all messed up.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that the
creator himself can't see

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
is a great irony.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
and then of course,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the alchemical
golem-ness The golem comes back

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:90%
to basically rip the creator up.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happens in the movie.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Batty comes back to kill Tyrell.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's his whole
purpose is to kill Tyrell.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, doesn't he
get him through the eyes?

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
He takes his eyes.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, he
takes his thumbs

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.091 align:middle line:90%
and smashes them into his eyes.

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So again,
the eye imagery,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the Masonic eye
imagery, it's all

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
intertwined here in a
brilliant fashion by Scott.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's face it.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
This is just brilliant.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, the eye is
what takes in the knowledge

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:90%
of the external world.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so it's
the source of how we

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.378 align:middle line:90%
learn things and know things.

00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So it has multiple
significances, as we said.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It has that intelligence,
technocrat significance.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But it also has that
gnostic significance

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of basically absorbing
everything that's

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
out there in the external world,
and in a platonic fashion,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
mirroring it in our minds.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how
computers work.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So replicants have eyes because
they are, as you said, golems.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you look to that medieval
Jewish qabalistic mythology,

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the idea of creating
the golem is initially,

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%
as you said, to have a servant.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But that servant can actually
turn on you and destroy you.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.505 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Next,
we're going to look

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
at the Nexus 6
revelation of Roy Batty

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.486 align:middle line:90%
and the double-headed eagle.

00:23:04.486 --> 00:23:05.402 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:05.402 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Knight takes queen.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.546 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:09.542 align:middle line:90%
It won't do.

00:23:09.542 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.370 align:middle line:10%
Why are you staring
at this, Sebastian?

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:26.505 align:middle line:10%
>> Because you're so different.

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.305 align:middle line:90%
You're so perfect.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.306 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:23:33.306 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What generation are you?

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Nexus 6.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I knew it.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So if you
notice, Roy Batty

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is playing on a
chess board here.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
black and white,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
which is the floor
of the Masonic lodge.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And what this suggests
is, if you notice,

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
there's behind him a
double-headed eagle.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The double-headed
eagle is the symbol

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
of the 32nd Degree
of the Scottish Rite.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's all about duality,
black, white, good, evil.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And Roy Batty is really this
Nietzschian, Ubermensch figure.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:84%
He's going to transcend
these classical notions

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of good and evil,
of black and white.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:90%
He's beyond that.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's, as we said, the cause
of the awakening of Deckard.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and the
Nexus 6 are of the top level

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:90%
of these replicants.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And the 33rd degree
level of Freemasonry

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is the next one up
above the Double Eagle.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
3 and 3 equals 6, saying that
Batty is better than you are.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He's actually
the top of the line.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And even this guy
is below the line.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, Batty
is the-- yeah, he's

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the return of the sophian
knowledge of gnosticism

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and the awakening of,
instead of the human species,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:90%
the replicants.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.596 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: The dark hero.

00:24:57.596 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why he's going to rebel
against Tyrell, because as you

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
said, that the death
programming has

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:90%
been put into the replicants.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:90%
He wants to live.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what he says
is, I want life.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:90%
And you won't give it to me.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So where they are here is
at the toymaker's abode.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And the toymaker is, in a way,
one of these lesser engineers

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:90%
under Tyrell.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you had the Asian guy
who was dealing with the eyes.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And presumably, this
guy makes the bodies,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
he does in his loft

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
there by himself is design
all these little creatures

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and characters.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And so again, Roy
is on this quest

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:90%
to find his way back to Tyrell.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.574 align:middle line:84%
And again, the whole
quest of the golem to get

00:25:38.574 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:90%
back to the alchemist.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Roy
Batty versus his creator.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:48.188 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not an easy
thing to meet your maker.

00:25:48.188 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And what can he do for you?

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Can the maker
repair what he makes?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you like
to be modified?

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Stay here.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.715 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Here we have what
we've been talking about,

00:26:01.715 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
this finding your way
back to the creator.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Same plot as
"Prometheus," right?

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Going back and taking
down whoever put into us

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.975 align:middle line:90%
this damn death programming.

00:26:11.975 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What seems to be the problem?

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Death.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Death.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm afraid that's a
little out of my jurisdiction.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You--

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.944 align:middle line:90%
>> I want more life, father.

00:26:24.944 --> 00:26:27.247 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.247 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What I like
about the whole scene

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is not only is the
lighting amazing,

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
but you can see the
fear in Tyrell's face.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
He knows that this
thing is not going

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:90%
to stop until it gets him.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that
Tyrell doesn't give up

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:90%
the ghost and reprogram him.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's at the auspices of
someone even more higher up

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
in this Freemasonry channel
than even him and he

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:90%
can't break that rule.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, and you'll
notice on his bathrobe there,

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
as he walks around like
a kind of Hugh Hefner,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%
he's got an owl logo.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the Tyrell logo itself
is the owl, which is all

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.630 align:middle line:84%
about that control,
that all-seeing eye,

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:84%
total technocratic dominance
that you mentioned.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I think to summarize
what "Blade Runner" is

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:84%
about is a warning, again,
of synthetic future.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've had the
warning in "Alien,"

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
in "Aliens," and
that franchise, that

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
dealt with tampering with the
biosphere, geoengineering,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
biological engineering,
cloning, and the hell

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that could unleash.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think here, we have a
warning about a giant globalist

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
melting pot dominated
by a giant corporation,

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:84%
a corporate government,
and then from there,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.137 align:middle line:84%
everybody else being
fed synthetic reality,

00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what
we see in "The Matrix."

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think the
warning of this film is.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.116 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There's a lot of
similarities between this film

00:27:48.116 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and "The Matrix."

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the title of the
film, "Blade Runner,"

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
is about how dangerous
this whole scene is,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's like running
on the edge of a blade.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to slip
for sure and fall.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's what's also

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
going on here is that Ridley
Scott is giving us a warning.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But oddly enough, it's kind
of an optimistic movie too

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
in that the AI is

false ideas about who and what

we are and how we got
here, then that state

is just going to
continue into the future.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand the
forces that were involved

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:90%
in shaping the modern world.

blinded to the afterlife.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.370 align:middle line:10%
We've become blinded to
higher consciousness.

Something is going on that takes

that veneer, and you

The greatest trick

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the devil ever played
was to convince

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
the world that he is God.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, from the
gnostic point of view,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:90%
isn't God at all.

that just mythology?

The mission was

to lead us to the
revelation that

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
would help us to understand
the true nature of things,

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
not the illusory nature
that's being created

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to hoodwink all of us, but the
real true nature of things.
