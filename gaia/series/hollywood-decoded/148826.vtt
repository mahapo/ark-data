deeper meaning to the Hollywood

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1997, James Cameron
released his blockbuster epic,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:90%
"Titanic."

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:10%
It became a
record-breaking film.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And in the film "Titanic," he
poses a question which I think

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
has gone largely
unnoticed by most people.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And that question is, are we
reaching the end of an age?

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Are we reaching
the end of an era?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And he uses this ship, this
iron ship, as his vehicle

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
for showing us that we are
headed towards certain disaster

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
if we continue on
the way we're going.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the question
that he poses in "Titanic,"

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
he answers in "Avatar."

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we've included
these two movies together

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
for this show today,
because not only

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
are those two movies the two
top-grossing films of all time,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
but I think Cameron
has this ability

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
to hit us in our mythological
place in our heart.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people miss it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
They think that these films
are facile, and they're not.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not superficial.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
They're deep films, and
Cameron is a deep guy.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But he masks everything in
this kind of superficial world

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
so you miss sometimes
the questions

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:90%
that he's posing and answering.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:10%
And it's so interesting,
because in the film,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:10%
he has all of the elites--

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:10%
the Guggenheims, and the Astors,
and all of the old aristocracy

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.361 align:middle line:10%
is actually in the film.

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, he actually
shows them in the film.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But he never really
ever poses the question,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.946 align:middle line:90%
why are they there?

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very interesting

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.987 align:middle line:90%
that he did it that way.

00:01:56.987 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
interesting about "Titanic"

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.778 align:middle line:84%
is that we know the
ending when we walked

00:02:00.778 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
into the theater,
which would mean

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
that there's no tension here.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We all know this
thing's going to sink.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:90%
So what is the tension?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.232 align:middle line:84%
And the tension, I
think, is that we

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
know our world's going
to come to an end.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That if we go on like we are,
our world's coming to an end.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.009 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
I never noticed

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
when this film came out--

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I was 18, I was
graduating high school.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
a goofy love story.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.396 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we all know what
happens to the "Titanic."

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
But now that I'm a
little bit older,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.524 align:middle line:84%
I realize that there's
a lot of layers to this.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just a
story about the history

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of the "Titanic."

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.369 align:middle line:84%
There's also this
subtle conspiracy text--

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that, like you said, he's
kind of asking that question,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
but not really going
that far into it.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also functions
as an allegory

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
for the end of an age,
the end of an era.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
You talked about moving into the
age of the giant industrialists

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and bankers.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.075 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what's going on here.

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So the ship
represents the sinking

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of the nobility,
the aristocracy.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Their time is done.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to be
ruled by these bankers.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just the
bankers, because--

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.704 align:middle line:90%
it's some of the bankers.

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
In the story, at least, some
of these bankers that are not

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.887 align:middle line:84%
part of the overall
new world order agenda

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
are actually going to
go down with the ship,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
or they're intended
to, at least.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the time
period this happens,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
1912, was a crucial
period, because we're

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
moving from horse and
buggy to the automobile,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
from little banks
to central banks.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.106 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole end of an era,
is dying at this moment.

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One year before
the Federal Reserve.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And JP Morgan, who owned
the company that owned

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
the "Titanic," was very much in
favor of the Federal Reserve.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
invited the bankers

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that were against his idea for
the creation of the Federal

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Reserve on board the
"Titanic's" maiden

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.045 align:middle line:84%
voyage, supposedly
so they could discuss

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to do
about the Federal Reserve.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
JP Morgan got a call
the day that it left,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't join
the rest of them.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's also another
conspiracy theory

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
around the whole
"Titanic" thing,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
which is that the ship that
sank wasn't even really

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:90%
the "Titanic."

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
There are two identical
ships, one the "Olympus"

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and one the "Titanic."

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And the "Olympus"
had been built first,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
in the Liverpool shipyards.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the "Titanic"
was being built.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And the "Olympus" got hit
by a British naval boat

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and smacked it
right in the middle.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
And they took it
back to Liverpool.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.151 align:middle line:84%
And the early reports were
that it was not fixable.

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And the insurance
companies were not

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
going to give any
payments for it

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
because they were blocking
a naval operation, which

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
was illegal anyway.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think that
the "Titanic" got switched out.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And they renamed the
"Olympus," the Titanic,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and renamed the "Titanic,"
the "Olympus"-- which went on

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
for another 20 years, by the
way, the "Olympus" sailing just

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:90%
fine.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:10%
But the Titanic may
have been a faulty ship.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:10%
Passengers on the ship reported
hearing weird engine sounds,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:10%
grinding sounds, like there was
something wrong with the ship.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
But it was veering all the time.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It was veering.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was what got wrecked,
was the rudder system.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And so that is another
layer of the conspiracy.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
people don't realize

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
is that this was really
the 9/11 of its day.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous professor,
Dr. Carroll Quigley.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And back in the late '60s,
he wrote a famous book

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.406 align:middle line:90%
called 'Tragedy and Hope."

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote it from the Council
on Foreign Relations archives.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And so he gives what he
says is the real history

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of the 20th century.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bunch of chapters
that deal with the Astors,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
or what we would call
the Cliveden set.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
is fascinating here

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
is that they're actually in
the background behind World War

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I and World War II.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It's this elite,
royal aristocracy

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.505 align:middle line:90%
that's connected to banking.

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're essentially
engineering the wars.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have a
problem using false flags.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The "Lusitania"
was a false flag.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a false flag.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.095 align:middle line:10%
>> So with the Gulf of Tonkin
later on, that we've discussed

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.845 align:middle line:10%
in another episode,
is another false flag.

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.112 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like false flags are
usually the triggers for wars.

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
see here is that it's

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
entirely possible that the
sinking of the "Titanic"

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
could be some kind
of false flag.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.844 align:middle line:84%
Insurance fraud-- we've
seen that in 9/11.

00:05:58.844 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It had many layers.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So many, many
possibilities here.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.555 align:middle line:84%
And we're only two
years from World War

00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I at this stage, which the
Astors were definitely behind.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And why did Cameron

signifies the end of all things,

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:10%
like the eon that
you're talking about.

>> And God shall wipe away

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:15.972 align:middle line:10%
and there shall
be no more death.

00:11:15.972 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This shifts into the age
of financial capitalism,

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the age of giant industrial
corporations, right?

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, too,
in the apocalypse,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:84%
you have the symbolism of
the stars and the luminaries.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
In biblical symbology, they
often represent rulers.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And so if you would
have an eclipse,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
this would be seen
as an omen or a sign

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.659 align:middle line:84%
that the present ruling elite
might be on their way out.

00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
There might be a
coup, or revolution,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:90%
or an invading army.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way,
you can see that

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that passing away of the
elite, the heavens, the stars,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
the big people, so to speak--

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:90%
they're over with.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:90%
They're done.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, one age dies.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.682 align:middle line:84%
But the other is a
resurrection of that age.

00:11:58.682 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we're going

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to get into when we
get into "Avatar,"

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is how we can recover
from the damage

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing to ourselves
and the environment.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So again, Cameron's
posing a question.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Is this the end of an age?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Are we headed towards
an inevitable ending?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.034 align:middle line:84%
And he answers that
question with "Avatar."

00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's so appropriate

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
that it's his next film.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Technology.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
built the "Titanic."

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But technology can then also
become the dangerous thing

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:90%
that can destroy us all.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why "Avatar"
has a positive message

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
as an answer to the "Titanic,"
is that there's actually

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:90%
a way out of this.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So in this clip,
Giovanni Ribisi--

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.317 align:middle line:84%
who's a great
actor, by the way--

00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:43.775 align:middle line:84%
he plays, I guess, the bad guy,
the head of the corporation

00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that's trying to mine the planet
where the Na'vi live, Pandora.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And he explains to
Sigourney Weaver

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
what they're really doing here.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You're supposed to be
winning the hearts and the minds

00:12:59.600 --> 00:12:59.925 align:middle line:90%
of the natives.

00:12:59.925 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
You look like them and
you talk like them,

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:90%
and they'll start trusting us.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.680 align:middle line:90%
We build them a school.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
We teach English.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:90%
But after what?

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:90%
How many years?

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
This is why we're
here, unobtainium,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the only reason.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's what pays for
the whole party.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:10%
It's what pays for your science.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:10%
Comprendo?

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:10%
Now those savages
are threatening

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:10%
our whole operation.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We're on the brink
of war, and you're

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:10%
So use what you've got
and get me some reasons.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.877 align:middle line:10%
There's a great book by William
F. Engdahl that's called

00:13:49.877 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:10%
"Full Spectrum Dominance."

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.793 align:middle line:10%
>> I love that book.

00:13:51.793 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And what he poses in that
is that the real mission

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:10%
of the Pentagon is total
full spectrum dominance

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:10%
of the entire planet.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have 5 to 800
known bases across the planet,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that this full
spectrum dominance

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
includes not just corporations
surveilling you or controlling

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
this or that resource,
but actually all of them.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And we see that exemplified here
with that pentagonal symbolism

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
their 3D hologram

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:90%
that they're watching there.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's explaining to
Sigourney Weaver that,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
do you understand, Miss
Scientist, that the real reason

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're here is this
resource, which is satirically

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
named unobtainium.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You'll never obtain all of
the resources on the planet.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually
why the Pentagon

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is at the behest of
these giant corporations.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's interesting,
because it appears that

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon has been taken
over by the corporations--

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly right.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --and that the Pentagon
is working straight

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
for the corporations now.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no shadow lines anymore.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's this is the
way the world is.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
Cameron is touching

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
on how we got to a situation
where we're using technology

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to rip planets apart, when
actually, the people that are

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:90%
primitive have no need of it.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a story I
heard once where

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
there was this fisherman
in South America,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and he had a little
place on the beach.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.665 align:middle line:84%
And every day, he'd go out
and fish, and feed his family,

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:90%
and he had a little garden.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really nice place.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And one day, a
capitalist came and said,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to buy your beach here.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, you'll
have enough money.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.514 align:middle line:90%
You'll never have to fish again.

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll never have to grow
food in your garden again.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Your family would be
taken care of forever.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And the little primitive
guy who's just not--

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.985 align:middle line:84%
didn't have much of an
education or anything,

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%
he's like, why would I do that?

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I actually enjoy
what I'm doing here.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Why would I wreck it
and wreck this place?

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand what
you're positing here, right?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And that story says
everything to me,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because yes, he will have
money, but will he be happy?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's going on here.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The Westerners, the
Earthlings, have money,

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
technology, and everything,
but it's never enough.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's said in there that
they've ruined their planet,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
so they had to come here to
parasitically vampire suck

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:90%
the juices out of this planet.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And Sam Worthington, at
one point in the movie,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:84%
he says, what are you
going to offer them?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Light beer?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, jeans?

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Is this what you're
going to offer them?

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't need it.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't want it.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] in Amerika,
the Rammstein song.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So what's neat
about this next clip

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going
to see the height

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:84%
of the technology of the
military industrial complex.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability now
to, like "The Matrix,"

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
transfer consciousness
into some other body.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:10%
>> And they've created
this synthetic version

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:10%
of the Na'vi, which Sam
Worthington's consciousness is

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:10%
going to be put into.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:10%
And he's part of
this wounded warrior

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:10%
sort of project,
where he'll be put

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:10%
into the synthetic alien
body to infiltrate.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
He's going to be a spy.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.092 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
transferring consciousness.

00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] 99%.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Link is stable.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:10%
>> This is based on real stuff
that the Pentagon works on.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:90%
DARPA, right?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
If we think about
the Salk Institute,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.759 align:middle line:84%
they've done a lot
of research into what

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:90%
they call the BRAIN Initiative.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And this is
brain-computer interfaces

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:10%
and how that can be overcome
the way that we usually

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:10%
think about it in terms
of a direct interface.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you hear me?

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.585 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear me, Jake?

00:17:15.585 --> 00:17:19.688 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] reflex is good.

00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] response normal.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling, Jake?

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, guys.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to your
new body, Jake.

00:17:27.882 --> 00:17:29.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that what we're
going to see in the future--

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.046 align:middle line:84%
and recent films have
been showing this;

00:17:33.046 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
not just "The Matrix,"
but "Ghost in the Shell."

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.169 align:middle line:84%
You have this idea where
the bodies are shells,

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and that we can actually just
transfer the consciousness over

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to some other surrogate
body, or you're

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be the avatar for this
other body that you're using.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I think
Cameron's talking about here.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And he would know about this
because of his long connection,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:84%
as we've discussed in
other Cameron episodes,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
about the deep state and what
Silicon Valley, and DARPA,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon
are really up to

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of technology.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's all very
interesting because it even

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:90%
goes back to like ancient Egypt.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They would actually
transfer what

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
they called the ka,
which is the localized

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
spirit, of the pharaoh into
the body of the next pharaoh.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So he had all the knowledge
of all the previous pharaohs.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had some kind
of bizarre science

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
about this, which we have a
lot of trouble deciphering

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphs exactly
what they were doing.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But we know that's
the basic idea.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So even back 4,000
years ago, the Egyptians

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.257 align:middle line:90%
were practicing some kind of--

00:18:32.257 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> A kind of reincarnation
that you control.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> A body transfer, yeah.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.079 align:middle line:84%
And I know that DARPA and those
guys are looking into this.

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I think they've actually
already accomplished it.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so many times, what
you see is in the research DARPA

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the scientists
that give presentations,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
they talk about how a lot of
what they're doing is a mimicry

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:90%
of nature.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.982 align:middle line:84%
They're creating something
from the natural world,

00:18:52.982 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's a synthetic
version of it.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And so many times in this
movie, what you'll see

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is all of the human
actors are looking

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
at some screen or some
hologram, something synthetic.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But all the Na'vi are actually
connected to the natural world,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:90%
the planet that they live on.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.014 align:middle line:84%
And they can do a lot of
what we see at the end.

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
They're able to actually
transfer the consciousness,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.360 align:middle line:84%
do the very things that
the Pentagon has spent--

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions and trillions.

00:19:15.444 --> 00:19:17.609 align:middle line:84%
>> --millions and trillions
on trying to figure out.

00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What's interesting
about this also,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the Na'vi are
not in their Kali Yuga.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
We are, though.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So we're in our Kali Yuga.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:90%
We're in our Iron Age still.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90%
We're ripping planets apart.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.676 align:middle line:84%
But the Na'vi are back
in their golden age.

00:19:30.676 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
They're at one with nature.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:10%
They can still communicate
telepathically.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:10%
The gnosis of the
planet is their goddess.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:10%
And so it's interesting
because what he's doing,

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:10%
he's juxtapositioning two
different kinds of ages,

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:10%
and having a war
between the two.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.534 align:middle line:84%
So the Hindus believed
that time was cyclical,

00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and that we've
moved through ages.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had a golden age
that we lived in, where

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:90%
there was no war, no violence.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.025 align:middle line:90%
Everybody got along.

00:19:55.025 --> 00:19:55.941 align:middle line:90%
>> A very long period.

00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Very long period.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
We were at one with nature.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And then things began to slip,
according to the Hindu Vedic

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:90%
texts.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We slipped into the Silver
Age next, a little more dense.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we slipped again into
what they call the Bronze Age--

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
bronze, again, a
little more denser.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we slipped
into the Iron Age,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
which is the age we're living
in now, which they call the Kali

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Yuga, the age of Kali, the
crone goddess who comes back

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
to set things right.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And she's angry.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
mean by the Kali Yuga.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The Earthlings are caught
in their final end here.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:90%
They've gone almost suicidally--

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --to the end of their world.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And now they're transferring
their suicidal ways

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to another world, where they're
going to destroy that world.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And that other world is not
in their same time sphere.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's pictured,
this other world here,

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:90%
very much like Earth.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.487 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind of
what it's an allegory for.

00:20:50.487 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're going to
see is that it's like a tree,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:10%
and its roots form a
kind of nervous system

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:10%
that are all
connected-- and there's

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:10%
actual scientific studies,
by the way, that shows

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:10%
that trees actually do this.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.906 align:middle line:84%
They communicate
with other trees

00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:90%
through their root systems.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So they transfer information
in much the same way

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.590 align:middle line:90%
that our neurons.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Aspen trees are all in
communication with each other.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and Sigourney Weaver
we've even mentioned that

00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like the way that
the human mind and its nervous

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
system and body--

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that the brain
transfers information

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
through these electrical
impulses as well.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So the planet is kind of
a mirror of the human.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why what we're going
to see in the final section

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
is the tree of life,
which, again, goes back

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.922 align:middle line:90%
to so many ancient cultures.

00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's a tree for a reason.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
But let's look at tree synapses.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>> You throw a stick
in the air around here,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:10%
it's going to land on some
sacred bird for chrissake.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not talking about some
kind of pagan voodoo here.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about something
real, something measurable

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:90%
in the biology of the forest.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is what, exactly?

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Sigourney Weaver has been
converted to the earlier age.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.385 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's still
in the Kali Yoga.

00:21:55.385 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And they can't communicate,
because they're

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
in different ages, or
in different times.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, what
are you talking about?

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> What we think we know
is there is some kind

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:10%
of electrochemical communication
between the roots of the trees,

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:10%
like the synapses
between neurons.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:10%
And each tree has 10
to the 4th connections

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:10%
to the trees around it.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And there are 10 to the
12th trees on Pandora.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.676 align:middle line:10%
>> It's more connections
than the human brain.

00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:10%
Get it?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:10%
It's a network It's
a global network,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:10%
and the Na'vi can access it.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:10%
They can upload and download
data, memories at sites

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.808 align:middle line:10%
like the one you just destroyed.

00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a great book by
a philosopher/esotericist .

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:90%
He's named Rene Guenon.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote a book called
"Reign of Quantity."

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.106 align:middle line:10%
And in that, he describes
what happens in the Kali Yuga

00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:10%
period, which he says
he thinks is now,

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:10%
or the Western civilization
is entering into that.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's the idea of the
reign of commodification

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and quantity.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
The more junk that you can
control, you win, basically.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's so self-destructive,
that it's suicidal,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we see
this as an allegory

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:84%
for American foreign policy,
going into these other nations,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
destabilizing them,
causing the chaos,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:90%
sending in agents and spies.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Sam
Worthington's character here,

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Jake-- he doesn't
realize that he's

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
the emissary of this
regime, this imperialism.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:84%
He's sent in as a spy, and he's
eventually even converted too.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see
that through this imagery

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.737 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of life and
how that's ultimately

00:23:33.737 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:90%
going to be his salvation.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.039 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Jake
Sully, signing off.

00:23:41.532 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:08.478 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING NA'VI]

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a famous religious
scholar named Mircea Eliade,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:10%
and he wrote a
book on shamanism,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.155 align:middle line:10%
as well as a lot of other
books on comparative religion.

00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:01.446 align:middle line:10%
He's one of the most prominent.

00:25:01.446 --> 00:25:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And he talks a lot about,
in shamanic traditions,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.444 align:middle line:90%
the use of the tree of life.

00:25:07.444 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:10%
And what's amazing
is that it's not just

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:10%
shamanic, animistic,
ancient traditions.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.772 align:middle line:10%
It's also part of Judaism.

00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:10%
It's part of the Bible.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:10%
It's part of Christianity.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:10%
Islam even has this tradition.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the idea
that at some point,

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
there was some
giant sort of tree

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.122 align:middle line:84%
or some symbolic tree that
connected all living things.

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they actually
worship on this planet.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And their tree has
been destroyed,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
but we see that it's already
in the process of regrowth.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So what the message
of this is just simply

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that you can't just have
technology and quantification

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
dominating everything,
commodities.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be about
harmony and actually

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
living in balance with
nature and the rest

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
of what's out there.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And like you pointed out,
Rene Guenon talks quite a bit

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
about that and shows us that
this disconnection from nature

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
is what is causing our
descent into the Kali Yuga.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.415 align:middle line:84%
And he evokes it in this
movie just perfectly,

00:25:59.415 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can tell.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What's going on here
in this movie is that

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:84%
we're transferring
personalities into bodies.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Na'vi have this
technology, or whatever it is.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And the military-industrial
complex has this.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And what this is is that every
brain has a frequency, which

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:90%
is like an address.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:10%
And you can take
that address and just

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:10%
simply change the frequency
and put that frequency

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:10%
into another body.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:10%
So consciousness is this
thing that can be directed

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:10%
and flowed.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Na'vi, their
consciousness is unity

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, so they're
connected to every living thing

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And ours is like
unitary consciousness,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
where each one of us
is a separate being,

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
where the Na'vi do things
in a more communal way,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly how they
did things in earlier ages.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.236 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the tree of life too,

00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:55.850 align:middle line:84%
it also hearkens back to both
Kabbalism and Neoplatonism.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is that this image
or this symbol of Sefirot,

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:10%
they're called, is a tree.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And what it is is
that this is the way

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:10%
that God, from His highest
level of reality and being,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:10%
kind of expresses himself
into the creative world,

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:10%
through different
levels of emanations.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And so for the individual,
it's the same thing,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
is that he has to
raise himself up

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.406 align:middle line:84%
through these levels of
initiation and understanding

00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to interpret the world,
so a theme that we've

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:84%
seen in other movies, like
"The Ninth Gate," right?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.644 align:middle line:84%
But here, it's
interesting because

00:27:27.644 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the military-industrial
complex doesn't have a tree.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't have any of that.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
All they have is this
kind of rape of nature,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Na'vi, as you said,
they're actually in tune with

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the more
healthy approach

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to enlightenment, which
is what they have,

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:90%
which is through nature.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And one other thing that I'd
like to mention about the tree

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest unobtainium is
right underneath the big tree.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Good point.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So they have to
destroy the big tree.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Destroy it, right.

00:27:55.624 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think in
that scene, again,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Cameron is sort of reinforcing
what happened on 9/11--

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, the absolute
horror of watching

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.020 align:middle line:90%
these buildings fall down.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And he evokes that
in that scene,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
where the tree falls down.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And the military did it, if
you understand my meaning.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:10%
And I think that seen
really grabbed a hold of us

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:10%
in 2009, because it was
only eight years after 9/11.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.420 align:middle line:10%
And again, Cameron's using
this apocalyptic kind

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:10%
of imagery to reinforce
and a historical event.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we saw in Titanic
was the dangers of technology,

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:84%
the rise of industrialism,
and where that might take us

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.910 align:middle line:90%
into technocracy.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward to whenever this is
in the dystopian future, total

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
technocracy running
everything, total military,

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Pentagon control.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.166 align:middle line:84%
And the way out of
this is discovered

00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:84%
by the Sam Worthington character
by actually just exiting

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that whole system and returning
to something more organic,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:90%
more natural.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the question that
gets answered by "Avatar."

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:58.782 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we have to go.

00:28:58.782 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what Cameron's saying.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I completely
agree with that.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we can bring
our toys with us,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
but I think we need
to go back to nature,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:84%
back to a more rural
kind of thing, where

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
we grow our own food and
take care of ourselves

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:90%
more than we do now.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
answer to the question posed

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.377 align:middle line:84%
in "Titanic"-- are we headed
towards the end of the world?

00:29:19.377 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
