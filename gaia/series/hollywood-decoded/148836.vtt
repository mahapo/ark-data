>> I don't think it's possible
to do a show about film

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:84%
and conspiracy without dealing
with possibly the most popular

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.169 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy TV show of
all time, "The X-Files."

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.585 align:middle line:84%
And really what
"The X-Files" does

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
is reveal everything that's
based in reality in terms

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.731 align:middle line:90%
of conspiracy.

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
chose it and that's

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
what we're going
to look at today.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It really was a
revolutionary show, heavily

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.256 align:middle line:84%
influenced by previous
shows like "Twin Peaks."

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It took place in the
Pacific Northwest.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
It had a credible
atmosphere about it,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and the acting and writing
was just top-notch.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And it does look
like Chris Carter had

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
some kind of connections
into the military industrial

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligence complex, and he
was revealing information.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:90%
The big question is--

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we're
going to be exploring here--

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:84%
in the show is, was he
releasing information

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:90%
that he was finding out?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Or was he releasing
information that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%
was given to him on purpose?

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think is fascinating
is that it's not just about

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
aliens or off-world entities
or genetic engineering.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
There's also a ton
of episodes that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
deal with mind control and the
occult and spiritual realities.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is
what makes it so unique,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.242 align:middle line:84%
in that you have shows that deal
with just aliens or just this.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, this
really encompasses

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of an alternative perspective
of how to understand the world.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's why at
the time it was so mind-blowing,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
because us in the conspiracy
community were watching it.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
eerie kind of feedback

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
of what research we were doing.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
There would suddenly
be an "X-Files"

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
episode on what you
were just looking at.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was also
at the same time,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
this was the emergence of
kind of conspiracy radio,

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
about '92, '91, with Art Bell.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this
whole conspiracy culture

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.565 align:middle line:84%
with Jim Keith and all these
people erupting into society

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a heady time to be
involved in it, because it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%
was so revolutionary.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And we had so many people
against what we were saying.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Then to have a Hollywood TV show
come out and confirm not only

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
our worst suspicions, but
actually our worst fears.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
it's such a great show.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.528 align:middle line:84%
It's also the time period
where the internet was just

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.002 align:middle line:90%
becoming the norm, right?

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And I remember when I
first got on the internet

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.087 align:middle line:10%
in the mid-'90s, you would
see conspiracy stuff.

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:10%
Some of the earliest
stuff that would pop up

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.185 align:middle line:10%
was conspiracy-related material.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely was.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So what we're going
to look at, though,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:10%
is a lot of clips that deal
with mind control and MK-ULTRA,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:10%
and how that actually ties into
big deep state programs related

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:10%
to everything in the universe,
actually in the whole biosphere

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:10%
and geoengineering.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at the
clip from "Fresh Bones."

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:10%
- This is the tree that
stopped Private McAlpin's car.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.546 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.546 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The state police reported
there was graffiti on the bark.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.409 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:10%
- It looks like some
kind of ritual symbol.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
- Most of the refugees
at Folkstone are Haitian.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Mrs. McAlpin believes Buddha
was behind her husband's death?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.607 align:middle line:10%
- Mrs. McAlpin doesn't believe
her husband killed himself.

00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:90%
She wants to know who did.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we have
here is a sigil.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
What this is supposed
to do is basically

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
initiate the ritual working.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it brings
upon a curse upon the military

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and people that are oppressing
sort of Haitian refugees

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was fascinating
because one of the consistent

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
themes throughout "X-Files" is
going to be the fact that you

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
would think that the masculine
Mulder-type character would be

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:84%
reason and
rationality and logic.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's flipped.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:84%
He's actually constantly
going on his intuition.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
He wants to believe
in more than just

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the physical scientism that
Scully is obsessed with.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is funny
about her character

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:84%
is that she is feminine,
but she's not really

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
at all interested
in her intuition.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:10%
She's always trying to find this
logical, rational explanation.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And almost 95% of the time
it's Mulder that's correct.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But I thought this was
a fascinating clip,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
because we overlook
the fact that "X-Files"

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
is not just about
UFOs and whatnot.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It's also about cults and mind
control and spiritual entities.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:10%
And Chris Carter
was known to have

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:10%
examined like Scientology, which
was right there in LA where

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:10%
he lived.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was quite fascinated
by cult techniques

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:90%
of mind control.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
that is fascinating,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
because at the time,
that was totally taboo.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-'90s, early '90s,
you just did not talk about it.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
If you did talk about
it, it was always

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
veiled in this like conservative
religious sense that was

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
controlling the mind control.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't really until later
when other researchers began

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
really pushing their stuff
that we began realizing--

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
Carter knew this--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
that there really were
these kind of connections

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
between religious
cults and mind control,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and that the intelligence
agencies were using it

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to their advantage.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.151 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:10%
And I like that in
this episode you

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.946 align:middle line:10%
have the combination
of scopolamine, which

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:10%
is this very powerful
drug that kind of makes

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:10%
you lose the
faculty of your will

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:10%
and you're very suggestible.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that's relevant is

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's a combination of
mind control, occult practice,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.477 align:middle line:90%
and the use of drugs.

00:05:57.477 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned intelligence
agencies and cults.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And if you go back to
the MK-ULTRA program

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:10%
in the earliest
days in the '40s,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:10%
they were actually studying
hallucinogens and truth serums,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:10%
trying to find some
sort of chemical basis.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was that
actually just exploded

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:10%
into this research into the
psyche and into sociology.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And it became this mass program.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Jim Keith.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:84%
One of his more famous
books is Mass Consciousness,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
where he's talking
about mass control

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
through MK-ULTRA in terms of
individuals being studied,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.527 align:middle line:84%
and then that expanding
out to the whole public.

00:06:32.527 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are "X-Files" episodes
that actually deal with that,

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
everything from TV signals being
used to mind control people

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to the implanting of microchips.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's back to
those electrodes

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that Jose Delgado
was involved in.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at this
episode, what's happening

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is the indication of
this sort of Baron

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Samedi-type character,
which is one of the Vodun

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:90%
that they worship.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's being invoked
to curse someone.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just that simple.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But it also utilizes
the techniques

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
of drug warfare,
chemical warfare.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I'm bringing it up

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the intelligence
agencies intensely

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
studied all this, like you're
talking about with Scientology.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.955 align:middle line:10%
And that all ties into MK-ULTRA.

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:10%
It was all connected.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>> All connected.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The development of LSD
comes from the Macy Foundation

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:10%
working with the Sandoz
pharmaceutical foundation

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:10%
to create something that
could be used as a pop-culture

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:10%
brainwashing
technique, I believe.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, absolutely.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's Dave
McGowan's argument.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>> If you read the
book "Acid Dreams"

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Colonel Hubbard spread LSD
all up and down the West Coast

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:10%
in the early '60s.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:10%
The CIA was responsible
for the spreading of LSD.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And so in this
episode, though,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:84%
what's interesting is that
you have the military directly

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
involved with this cult. And who
is the real cult leader here?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Haitian refugees.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's actually one
of the generals

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
who was initiated into
the shamanic practices

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.888 align:middle line:84%
And so he's the
one that's actually

00:07:57.888 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:90%
doing the black magic here.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, suggesting like
Michael Aquino and some

00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:03.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Presidio stuff.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.941 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's very interesting that
Chris Carter knew about this

00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
That was pretty
mature for that time.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So this next episode we're
going to look at, "Closure."

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And "Closure" deals with Mulder
learning the totality of what

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
happened to his sister.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
For the first half
of the show, we're

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
worried about his
abducted sister.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Was it aliens?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Was it the government?

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out that it
was the Cigarette Smoking Man,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and it was for a specific
government project.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.252 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:33.252 --> 00:08:34.052 align:middle line:10%
- Mulder.

00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:10%


00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing?

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:10%
- It's here.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.879 align:middle line:10%
- What is?

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:10%
- There was a boy.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:10%
He led me into this room.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:10%
- Mulder.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:10%
- It's a diary.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:10%
It's your sister's.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:16.742 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.742 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
- "I did more tests today."

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So this basically sums up
the totality of "The X-Files."

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Mulder discovers
his sister's diary,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
which records these
tests that were

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:84%
done where Cigarette Smoking Man
actually took Mulder's sister.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't an alien abduction.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It was him that took
her for these tests

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:90%
on this military base.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And it specifically is said to
be MK-ULTRA-type experiments.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:90%
So there was a deal made.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The government wanted to link
up with the alien race that

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
was coming to basically
depopulate the Earth.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the conspiracies
that we hear about

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
bantered around, you mentioned
since the '90s on the internet,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
it's all explained in "The
X-Files," ultimately basically

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
being true, including
even genetic modification.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to engineer
a cancer virus to wipe out

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the population.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's also interesting
that he touches on something

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
which I really didn't
believe but I'd

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:90%
heard about until recently.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is this whole idea
that the government is actually

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
testing children in
school and figuring out

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
which ones they want to bring
into their special programs.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I keep coming
up against this

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
over and over as I investigate
like different things

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic disclosure, and
I find that they're now--

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.895 align:middle line:84%
and were at this time, and
actually ever since the late

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:90%
'70s--

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
using children in
these programs,

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.897 align:middle line:84%
in long-term programs,
in which the parents

00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:90%
don't know about it.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
The child doesn't know about it.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And Mulder may be part of
this mind control program

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:90%
that his sister is in.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this episode
references back to Season 3,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the most famous "X-Files"
episodes, "Paper Clip."

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And in "Paper Clip," you
have the Nazi scientist being

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
brought over, you
know, post World War II

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
to basically create NASA
and the MK-ULTRA program.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most incredible
"X-Files" ever, that episode.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> But yeah.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
He's recalling that episode and
then advancing the ball forward

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we really
didn't know back then.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want
to tell everybody.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
We did not know that
this was going on.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Who in the '90s was
familiar with Paper Clip?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Very few people.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Very few people.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.456 align:middle line:10%
That's why it was
so shocking when

00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:10%
you saw it, because it was
like just whispered about

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this next clip we're
going to look at what's called

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:90%
"Via Negativa."

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And this relates
directly to theology.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the idea of
learning about the divine

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
or the transcendent
through negation.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Since we don't know
what infinity is,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what
omniscience is,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
we have to define these terms
basically by what they're not,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So omniscience is not
being finite, right?

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought there's a
curious title for this episode,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
because once again we
have this veteran who

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
has gone through some kind
of mind control programming.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.422 align:middle line:84%
And he starts his
own religious cult.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And this religious cult revolves
around the all-seeing eye.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.864 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:06.864 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:10%
- Is this every member?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.434 align:middle line:10%
- Except one.

00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:12.100 align:middle line:10%
Their leader, Anthony
Tipet, is missing.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:10%
- Tipet was a convicted murderer
who claimed to have found God.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:10%
We didn't think we were dealing
with an apocalyptic cult.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:10%
We've seen this kind
of thing before.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:10%
Jonestown, Heaven's Gate.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.979 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.979 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:10%
- I don't care how
devoted they were.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.853 align:middle line:10%
These people wouldn't just
lie here and let their leader

00:12:39.853 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:10%
bash their brains in.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:10%
I got to figure at
least one of them would

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:10%
have had a problem with that.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.555 align:middle line:10%
- It's something
I've considered.

00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:47.656 align:middle line:10%
I'm running tox tests
on the bodies for drugs.

00:12:47.656 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:10%
- Does that include
our man in the car?

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So the all-seeing eye is a
curious usage in this episode.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's explained to be
related to the third eye, right?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And for this cult leader, this
vet who again kind of goes

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
nuts after whatever
programming he went through,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
he uses his third-eye telepathic
powers to murder people.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Now that's obviously a little
bit I would say exaggerated.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's some truth to this,
because it recalls real cult

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
murders, like Heaven's Gate
and others like Jonestown

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned earlier.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I find it interesting that
the vet is creating these

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
ritualized murders in the same
way that Heaven's Gate was

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
doing it.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was, again, right
around the same time period.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So Carter is echoing current
events in a strange way.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But he's also-- the
third eye really

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been put into the public
consciousness at this time.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:90%
This was a new concept.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not against
new-agers or whatever,

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
but among people watching
TV this was pretty amazing.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What I found really poignant
here was that Doggett comes

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in as the skeptic
to replace Scully.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Scully's having mommy
issues, because she's

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
got this hybrid alien baby that
she's trying to give birth to.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.957 align:middle line:84%
So Doggett comes
in as a skeptic.

00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't believe
in any of this stuff.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But yet he's confronted with,
again, ritual murders and mind

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
is that in this episode,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
once again the Lone Gunmen
are helping Doggett.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
And they do some research.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And they say, hey, this
guy was actually involved

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:90%
in the MK-ULTRA program.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And they gave a whole bunch
of LSD to these people.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.852 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had bad
trips and kind of went nuts.

00:14:29.852 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And their third eye was
opened to see something dark.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, this guy's
essentially possessed.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So in the next
clip, this is kind

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of the summation of the grand
unified field conspiracy

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
theory that is "The
X-Files" mythology.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And what Joel McHale does
is kind of lump everything

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:84%
together into one, which I
think is the grand conspiracy

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:10%
- What are they trying to do?

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:10%
- That's the missing piece.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:10%
- But it's not hard to imagine,
a government hiding, hoarding

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:10%
alien technology for 70 years,
at the expense of human life

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:10%
and the future of
the planet, driven

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:10%
not only by corporate greed,
but a darker objective.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:10%
- The takeover of America.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:10%
- And then the world itself,
by any means necessary,

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:10%
however violent or
cruel or efficient,

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:10%
by severe drought brought on by
weather wars conducted secretly

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:10%
using aerial contaminants and
high-altitude electromagnetic

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:10%
waves, in a state
of perpetual war,

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:10%
to create
problem-reaction-solution

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:10%
scenarios to distract, enrage,
and enslave American citizens

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:10%
at home, with tools like the
PATRIOT Act and the National

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Defense Authorization Act,
which abridge the Constitution

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:10%
in the name of
national security.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:10%
The militarization of police
forces in cities across the US;

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:10%
the building of prison camps
by the Federal Emergency

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:10%
Management Agency with
no stated purpose;

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:10%
the corporate takeover
of food and agriculture,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:10%
pharmaceuticals,
and health care.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Even the military and
clandestine agendas to fatten,

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.650 align:middle line:10%
dull, sicken, and
control a populace

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:10%
already consumed by consumerism.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:10%
- And I encourage you
all to go shopping more.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:10%
- A government that taps your
phone, collects your data,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:10%
and monitors your
whereabouts with impunity,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:10%
a government preparing to use
that data against you when

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:10%
it strikes and the
final takeover begins.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:10%
- The takeover of America.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:10%
- By a well-oiled and well-armed
multi-national group of elites

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:10%
that will cull,
kill, and subjugate.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:90%
- Happening as we sit here.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
- It's happening all around us.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:10%
- The other shoe
waiting to drop.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:10%
- It will probably
start on a Friday.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:10%
The banks will announce
a security action

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:10%
necessitating their computers
to go offline all weekend.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:10%
- Digital money will disappear.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:10%
- They can just
steal your money?

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:10%
- Followed by the detonation of
strategic electromagnetic pulse

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:10%
bombs to knock out major grids.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:10%
- What will seem like
an attack on America

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:10%
by terrorists or Russia.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:10%
- Or a simulated
alien invasion, using

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:10%
alien replica vehicles that
exist and are already in use.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.109 align:middle line:10%
- An alien invasion of the US?

00:16:57.109 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:10%
- The Russians tried it in '47.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:10%


00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:10%
- You can't say these things.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:10%
- I'm going to
say them tomorrow.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:10%
- It's fear-mongering claptrap
isolationist technoparanoia,

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:10%
so bogus and dangerous
and stupid that it borders

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.526 align:middle line:10%
on treason.

00:17:17.526 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:10%
Saying these things would
be incredibly irresponsible.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:10%
- It's irresponsible
not to say it.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:10%
- Especially if it's the truth.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.330 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we have a cornucopia,
with Bush coming in, who is

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.865 align:middle line:84%
the father of this whole
PATRIOT Act, and terrorists,

00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:35.185 align:middle line:84%
the terrorists are
coming to get us.

00:17:35.185 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you with us
or you're against us?

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
The explanation that Joel
McHale's character here gives

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:90%
is basically correct.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
most of what he says

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
is the real conspiracy
that's going on.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.476 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a
great bookend on "X-Files."

00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Obviously there will
be another season.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But for what we have
of the first 10,

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that really sums up the
totality of "The X-Files,"

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
with everything from
HAARP to geoengineering

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.064 align:middle line:90%
to controlled destabilization.

00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You have people
from the Pentagon,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:84%
like Zbigniew
Brzezinski, who writes

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.082 align:middle line:84%
about destabilizing
other countries

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and how this works
for global government.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
encapsulates it all.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.279 align:middle line:84%
It also shows globalism, global
consumerism, corporate control.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
There's actual studies
that have been done,

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
TED Talks have
been done that show

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
that you can graph
the five or six

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
major corporations that control
huge industries like pharma,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
All of this is controlled
by just a few shareholders.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we have a
corporate global government

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in 2008, there was
a Swiss study where they were

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
trying to disprove the
worldwide conservatorship.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And they concluded
that 134, I think it is,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.552 align:middle line:84%
corporations run 90%
of the world's economy.

00:18:44.552 --> 00:18:45.352 align:middle line:90%
>> 90%.

00:18:45.352 --> 00:18:46.152 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And that 800 men run
those 134 corporations.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:90%
So they concluded, this study--

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a peer-reviewed proof
of global government, right.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --that 800 men
run the world, right?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we can see in
this last soliloquy

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
that Carter is trying
to get the word out.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And somehow in this
reboot, he's been

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:90%
told that he has to say this.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Now again, there's this whole
conspiracy going on right now

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
where there's some good guys
called the Alliance and then

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
these bad guys that are
called like the Empire.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's an internecine
war within the intelligence--

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is in "The X-Files."

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is in "The X-Files."

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You have the Syndicate and
then the good guys, right?

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And Carter may be
part of the Alliance.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it
from this episode,

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that he's part of the Alliance
and he's trying to warn us,

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
because that had to be
the most-watched show

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of the series, because it was
the first one in the reboot.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And he knew he could
not waste his time.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
He had to say everything
and get it all out.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And when it was all done,
Scully still is not a believer.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think the take-away
from "The X-Files"

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
ultimately is that we
can't trust the government.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
This is what Mulder
has believed all along.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Mulder is completely vindicated.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
He's been right about 95% of
everything that he thought.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The government has
no qualms about using

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
kids, about trafficking,
about stealing,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
kidnapping kids for testing.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The government is owned by
corporations, as you mentioned,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.915 align:middle line:84%
that are already
essentially linked globally.

00:20:21.915 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what "The
X-Files" is presenting.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I love too that
that last clip also

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
mentioned electromagnetic
warfare and HAARP, chemtrails,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and geoengineering.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:90%
That's all there.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
at actual studies

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
from the VLF
Institute at Stanford

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that talk about HAARP being
used for geoengineering.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a
conspiracy theory.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's almost
like the military

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:10%
went through the entire
plethora of human history,

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:10%
of all the disasters
that have ever happened,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:10%
from famines to volcanoes
to air poisoning.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And they've decided to
weaponize everything.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Weaponize everything.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have
at our fingertips

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the ability to destroy the
entire planet in a second.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
real problem we face.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Once again, Scully
represents cognitive dissonance.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
She's the person who's convinced
that no matter what evidence

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
is presented before
her, she's still

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
going to fall back
into that skepticism,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's easier.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult; it's
a challenge to have

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
our paradigms
questioned and to accept

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
things that may not fit with
the way we want reality to be.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way, she
represents the public.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people you can show
them so many times facts

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and truths and hard
evidence, and you understand

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately some
people are just not going

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
to accept what's
before their face

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.792 align:middle line:90%
because it's too difficult.

00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think that's true.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And when she says that
it's irresponsible to put

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
this information out like this,
and then Mulder shoots back,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
well, it's irresponsible
not to do it.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who is in pursuit
of the truth, of course,

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:90%
wants to hear it all.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't want anybody
buttering it up or anything.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know many, many people
that are like Scully that I've

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
presented the evidence so
clearly and they actually,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in some ways while I'm
presenting the evidence

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.015 align:middle line:90%
are in agreement with me.

00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
But after I leave, they go right
back to where they were before,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:90%
not believing.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's too terrifying for them.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And denial is not
just a river in Egypt.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we see here.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's almost like it's not
just a show about conspiracies.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.122 align:middle line:84%
It's also a show about people
confronting conspiracies--

00:22:32.122 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And their reactions.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --and their reactions
and psychology, ultimately.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And the thing is is if
you look back at great works

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:90%
of art, like Shakespeare--

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
He was a great
human psychologist.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> He was.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And his greatest plays
are all conspiracies.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:90%
"Macbeth," "Hamlet."

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They're all a conspiracy
at the very top of power

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and a guy who's naive and
doesn't understand it,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
like Hamlet.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he has to face
that reality, right?

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this is about.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And these are why these
are the most famous plays

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
of Shakespeare.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:90%
We love conspiracy.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
The Declaration
of Independence is

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
nothing but one long conspiracy
theory against King George.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.248 align:middle line:84%
What I always say
is that if people

00:23:09.248 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
have a problem with conspiracies
or conspiracy theory,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
a weaponized term

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.926 align:middle line:90%
that the CIA came up with--

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:14.725 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> --around the time of
the JFK assassination,

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
all they have to do is
think about espionage.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves spy stories.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves James Bond.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
That's all conspiracy,
just under a different term

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:90%
called espionage, right?

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Governments are conspiring.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to say that if you're
going to call me a conspiracy

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
theorist, then I get to call
you a coincidence theorist.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Coincidence theorist.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:90%
So what is "X-Files?"

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
"X-Files" is a revelation
of the government's method.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a revelation of the
government not being an entity

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can trust, because
it's not really a government.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately a
corporate government.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And Chris Carter is
warning us about this.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly a warning
from some faction

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:84%
within the military industrial
complex that wants us

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:90%
to know what's really going on.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Join us again next time
on "Hollywood Decoded."

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And thanks for watching.
