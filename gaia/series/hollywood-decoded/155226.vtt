00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.386 align:middle line:84%
and you're watching
"Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:13.386 --> 00:00:18.932 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:21.889 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Today we're going to
be talking about "The Lord

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Rings" trilogy.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
So the next film in the
trilogy is "The Two Towers."

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And wow.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:90%
What a name, right?

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We immediately
think of 9/11, and I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
do believe there's a 9/11
significance to this.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Jay agrees.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
He's got a lot of facts on that
that we're going to talk about.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.736 align:middle line:84%
But "The Two Towers"
represents the kind

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.927 align:middle line:84%
of "Empire Strikes Back"
sequel where we almost

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
think that the good guys
aren't going to make it, right?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The bad guys seem to
get the upper hand.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:90%
This is classic in trilogies.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But what we're going to look at
is the spiritual transformation

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
of Gandalf, which is very
important in this scene,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and the revelation from Saruman
that he's actually a bad guy

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and that the war
machine, the Pentagon,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the military-industrial
complex that we're

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
being warned about
from Tolkien, this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:90%
is all at the aegis of Sauron.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Satan, right?

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Who sits atop as a flaming
eye, the all-seeing eye, right?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The races are
divided and conquered

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:90%
by this one all-seeing eye.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Jay, what do you think?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, I think
that Tolkien was definitely

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
aware of the all-seeing
eye of Freemasonry

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and was trying to warn us
about the new world order.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:90%
There's no coincidence.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Two towers right
around the time of 9/11?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
that's the thing.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The first movie was
released in December 2001,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and we were all
reeling from 9/11.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of needed
this movie at this time.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And I know I did.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.165 align:middle line:84%
And then when the second
movie came out a year later

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
"The Two Towers"

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and it started
calling forth, you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
know, this idea that possibly
9/11 was the beginning

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:90%
of the end of our Fourth Age.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
occurs to me, I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
saw a painting by Alex Gray
the other day called "Gaia."

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And it had the Tree of Life.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.172 align:middle line:84%
And on one side, it had
the world as we like it,

00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and it was very much
like a Middle Earth,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
a very pleasant world
of beautiful plants.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side was
the world that we don't want.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, this painting
was painted years before 9/11,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and it has the Twin Towers
and two airplanes flying by.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So again, art is prophetic.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Prophetic, yeah.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think
Tolkien again was somehow--

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he
knew, except maybe

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.949 align:middle line:84%
intuitively, that somehow,
when the Hollywood

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
version of this thing came
out, it would have something

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:90%
to do with the end of this age.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:10%
In the late 1800s, Dostoyevsky
wrote "The Possessed,"

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:10%
or "Demons."

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.855 align:middle line:10%
And in that novel, the
revolutionary socialists

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:10%
actually say that they're going
to bring in the utopia on top

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:10%
of 100 million skulls.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually 30,
40 years prior to 1917,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
the Bolshevik
Revolution, and then

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
we had the Maoist
Revolution later.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have over
100 million souls

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:90%
dying as a result of this.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a key example
of literature being prophetic.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I see "The Lord of the
Rings" in the exact same vein,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
something prophetic
because it's looking

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
back to mythological archetypes
and patterns in history.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And so many great
philosophers and historians

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
have talked about these
cycles and patterns.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Oswald Spengler wrote
"Decline of the West,"

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.519 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about
these ages, these yugas.

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Tolkien's
warning us about.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
absolutely right, that 9/11--

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
9 is a symbol, a
number in numerology

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that relates to initiation, and
particularly dark initiation,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:90%
the dark path.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.758 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
what happened on 9/11

00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
was a kind of initiation,
an attempt to maintain

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the dark power as it's
crumbling, as it's actually

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:84%
falling apart in the midst
of spiritual transformation

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and awakening.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what this scene with
Gandalf battling the Balrog

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and coming back, and
why it's so important.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think
that the parallels

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
between the time that
the movie came out

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and what Tolkien
is trying to say

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
were so strange
in that there was

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
like this weird coincidence
going on that Tolkien

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
had nothing to do with.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Yet somehow, it
came out that way.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But it's
not grim at all,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because just like
with Gandalf, when

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf faces this
seeming demon that there's

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
no way he could beat this
thing, and he actually

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:90%
beats it, right?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Frodo is who beats
Sauron, right?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
The greatest spiritual evil
in all of Middle Earth.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.215 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in the same way,
we might see things like 9/11,

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
we might think that, oh,
it's the end or something.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, no, it's not.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
When we overcome these things,
when we overcome traumas,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:90%
we're actually--

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
like Gandalf, we're taken to
a whole other spiritual level.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Now I
think in a way today,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
we're all kind of Frodo,
trying to bring the ring back

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:90%
to Mount Doom.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to all of us now
to recognize what's going on

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.284 align:middle line:90%
in this world and conquer it.

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's a kind of
spiritual resurrection.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.518 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
resurrection going on.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, this has such parallels
with "Lord of the Rings."

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Like the Palantir stone.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Another thing handed
out as a kind of trick

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that I think the forces
of good ultimately

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
turn against the
forces of evil, right?

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at that
overcoming of death

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and the demonic by Gandalf
as he comes back in "darkness

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
took me."

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GANDALF: Darkness took
me, and I strayed out

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.516 align:middle line:90%
of thought and time.

00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Stars wheeled overhead,
and every day was as long

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.675 align:middle line:90%
as a life age of the Earth.

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:38.245 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:90%
But it was not the end.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.118 align:middle line:90%
I felt life in me again.

00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:90%
[GASP]

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.627 align:middle line:84%
I'd been sent back
until my task is done.

00:05:49.627 --> 00:05:50.427 align:middle line:90%
>>ARAGORN: Gandalf.

00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.925 align:middle line:90%
>>GANDALF: Gandalf?

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:55.725 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:55.725 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
That was what they
used to call me.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.835 align:middle line:90%
Gandalf the Grey.

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.265 align:middle line:90%
That was my name.

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:10.065 align:middle line:90%
>>GIMLI: Gandalf.

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GANDALF: I am
Gandalf the White.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So Gandalf himself
overcomes temptation.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.293 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, he's
actually tempted by the ring

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
as well at the very beginning.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
When Frodo attempts to
give it to him, he says no,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:90%
but he's tempted.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:90%
He has to battle this demon.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's only through
overcoming this

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that he reaches a new
level of spiritual power.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, he can't exercise
or never does exercise demons

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
until he returns as
Gandalf the White.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And then he's able to
successfully overcome

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the demonic power
of Saruman that's

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
controlling the King of Rohan.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf is the central
figure of the movie,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
moving pieces around on
the gigantic chess board.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
He is the alchemist
who knows the future.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It's up to him to
orchestrate these events.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I think he wants us
to at least realize

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the potential for
virtuous leadership.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:90%
There can be a virtuous leader.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And when there is
a virtuous leader,

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
it ends up blessing
everyone, right?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what's
crucial about this scene

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
is that death is
not to be feared.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what everybody
really fears, is dying.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
When they embark on this great
journey, the fellowship--

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
they often talk about
the fear of death.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And Gandalf is the one who dies.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back, and he has
a conversation with Pippin

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and he says, it's
nothing to fear.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is necessary
for our transformation.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And you notice he
actually becomes

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
united to his higher
self, to the ideal

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:90%
of who he was supposed to be.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what that whole
entire sequence is about,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is him becoming fully
into his fullness.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And now that he's in his
fullness, he can defeat Sauron.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what that's about.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
that we understand

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that the king that's going
to take over the Fourth Age

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:90%
has to have elfin blood in him.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
That elfin blood
inside his human blood

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.746 align:middle line:84%
will help his progeny govern
during the Fourth Age.

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
he's saying also--

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Tolkien, that is-- is that as
that bloodline becomes diluted,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:90%
the evil will rise back up.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
happened in the Third Age.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I think the bloodlines
became diluted.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.169 align:middle line:84%
The elfin bloodlines
became diluted.

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
They no longer had the
power that they once

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.772 align:middle line:84%
had to control Sauron, and
that's how Sauron controls us.

00:08:35.772 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think you're
right, because you

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
have explicit mention
of the Uruk-hai, which

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
are these genetically modified
soldiers, these orc-men hybrids

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that are bred for
battle by Saruman.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's explicitly
said to be sorcery.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there is
absolutely this bloodline theme

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to think of that as,
like, an evil Illuminati thing.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's also
possible that you

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.974 align:middle line:90%
can have good bloodlines.

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And in
this clip, we're

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
going to find out that
Aragorn has elfin blood.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EOWYN: My uncle told
me a strange thing.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
But he must be mistaken.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ARAGORN: King Theoden
has a good memory.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
He was only a small
child at the time.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.185 align:middle line:84%
>>EOWYN: Then you
must be at least 60.

00:09:25.185 --> 00:09:28.149 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:28.949 align:middle line:90%
>>ARAGORN: No.

00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EOWYN: 70?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:90%
You cannot be 80?

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ARAGORN: 87.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EOWYN: You are
one of the Dunedain,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
a descendant of Numenor,
blessed with long life.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ARAGORN: There
are few of us left.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.675 align:middle line:84%
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

00:09:56.675 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>EOWYN: I'm sorry.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So now
we know why Aragorn

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to rule at the
beginning of the Fourth Age.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:84%
A lot of religious
traditions have this idea

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of back in the primeval
era, the golden age,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
longer lifespan.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:90%
We see that in the Bible.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:90%
We see that in the Vedas.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We see that in the
Mesopotamian texts.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's definitely
where he's drawing from,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
something about bloodlines

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.442 align:middle line:84%
and genetic memories,
race memories.

00:10:24.442 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:90%
That's actually a real thing.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Modern geneticists
have confirmed

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:90%
the existence of race memories.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I think Tolkien is very
fascinating in that he lived

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.466 align:middle line:84%
prior to a lot of
genetic discoveries,

00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
but he's actually
kind of echoing

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
these ideas from mythology.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
He was picking up
whatever science

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:90%
that they were using back then.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:90%
They claim it was magic.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think definitely,
Tolkien wants

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
us to understand that
this was a magical world,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and that this magic was
a kind of a technology,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and controlling everything.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Sauron
could control--

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It is.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And Sauron and Saruman are
using sorcery, black magic.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.935 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's evil science, and
that's why they have

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:90%
weaponry, bombs, gunpowder.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And they genetically
modify the Uruk-hai.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
That's an actual
breeding of orc and men

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to have this sort of dog
race that is cannibalistic

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that goes out and
eats their opponents.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that knowledge or
hermetic science or magic

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
can be turned to good or evil.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and Tolkien
is definitely saying that.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, we look at this film and
we see a vast nesting of ideas.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And the book too.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
A vast nesting of ideas,
of historical ideas,

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
spiritual ideas, the idea
that even at the darkest hour,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:90%
we can still win.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
That we have help from
more than human beings

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.832 align:middle line:84%
who maybe even live here
among us like Gandalf,

00:11:59.832 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they
still live among us.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely rumors
in modern alchemy circles

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that there's a group of people
that are wizards who control

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.109 align:middle line:90%
events through deep meditation.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're good
wizards, and they're

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
fighting the Illuminati
and the bad guys.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Just like Gandalf, they're using
their powers in a subtle way

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the opposition to
frustrate the powers that be.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what Gandalf

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:90%
is doing in this series.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:90%
So Arwen has a choice.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
She can either go to
the west with the elves,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
or she can stay with her
love, Aragorn, right?

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And she is debating with herself
whether she should do this.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And this clip kind
of shows both sides

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
of what will happen if she
decides to become a human

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
or live in the human
world and watch everyone

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that she knows die off while
she keeps her semi-immortality.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a great clip.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Jackson at
his finest, actually.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.665 align:middle line:90%

bloodline for the king.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.095 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:13.095 --> 00:14:13.895 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this has
so much melancholy in it.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, again,
a very optimistic

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
view that the elves
would give us such a gift

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:84%
as their bloodline, and
help us as we become

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:90%
the leaders of the Fourth Age.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that tree, which
is so significant at the White

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
City, the Tree of
the King, as it said.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
If we think about
ancient Nordic mythology,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we have what's called
Yggdrasil, and that's

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
the Nordic Tree of Life.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.159 align:middle line:84%
And it's this giant
tree that expands

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire universe.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The universe is conceived
as a big living tree.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And here, that tree
is placed as symbolic

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of the life of the king
and his royal bloodline.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so for humanity to continue
in the Middle Earth world,

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:90%
it needs that leadership.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It needs that strength
that can overcome Mordor.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's only Aragorn
that can do that,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.435 align:middle line:84%
but he needs a royal
bloodline, and so

00:15:06.435 --> 00:15:08.696 align:middle line:84%
that's where that
sacrificial aspect of Arwen

00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:90%
comes into play here.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.582 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and it
also recalls King Arthur.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And when King Arthur
is betrayed by Sir Lancelot,

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:90%
the kingdom dies.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:90%
His entire kingdom begins dying.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The trees die, the
crops stop growing,

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and everything because the
love has been taken out

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But when he's reunited
with everybody,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
then the kingdom reunites
and it starts growing again.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And when Aragorn
becomes the king,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.169 align:middle line:90%
the White Tree comes back--

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It comes
back to life, right.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's Edenic imagery
of the tree of life.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: As if there is a
kind of a link between the Earth

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and our soul.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Soil and soul.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is an old myth that--

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, because we die and
we decay and turn into the soil

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are the soil
and we are the Earth,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they're
saying in "Lord of the Rings."

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So this clip is what you
mentioned just a few minutes

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
ago, about Gandalf explaining
what death is like to Pippin.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PIPPIN: I didn't think
it would end this way.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.895 align:middle line:90%
>>GANDALF: End?

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:84%
No, the journey
doesn't end here.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Death is just another path,
one that we all must take.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.695 align:middle line:84%
The gray rain-curtain of
this world rolls back,

00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and all turns to silver glass.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.316 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:40.789 align:middle line:90%
And then you see it.

00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PIPPIN: What?

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Gandalf?

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:90%
See what?

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GANDALF: White shores, and
beyond a far green country

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%
under a swift sunrise.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.726 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.154 align:middle line:90%
>>PIPPIN: Oh.

00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:09.932 align:middle line:90%
That isn't so bad.

00:17:09.932 --> 00:17:10.732 align:middle line:90%
>>GANDALF: No.

00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:13.558 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.558 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So in this clip,
clearly, Gandalf is saying,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
there's an afterlife.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.170 align:middle line:90%
There's a life after this life.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
He's not real clear about it
except that it's beautiful.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've seen enough
near-death experiences very

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
similar to what he's explaining
to know that death probably

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
is not the grievous experience
that we're being taught it is,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
probably a relief.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
Gandalf is conveying here.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is also conveying
the overall optimism

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:90%
of Tolkien and Peter Jackson.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
That in the end, we're
going to get this right,

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and there really
is nothing to fear.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, it's
the microcosm.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:90%
The microcosm, right?

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
individuals in the film

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
when they face up to death,
to their fears and so forth

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and overcome it,
it's the same way

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
with what Tolkien's warning us
about with the new world order,

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
with the Pentagon, the
military-industrial complex,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It looks bleak, but
we always overcome.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Humanity survives.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:90%
There's an afterlife.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to fear death.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
so great and so

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
relieving is this scene where
you see the fall of the eye.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
favorite scenes in I

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
think all of movie
history, because it's

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:90%
so significant, so symbolic.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You know, it goes
back to Freemasonic symbology

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and how Tolkien and
Peter Jackson are

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:90%
both very aware of this.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And Peter Jackson shows it
as a surveillance operation,

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
which it is.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
the fall of the eye.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:90%
[YELLING]

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:90%
[CREAKING]

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice all the armies
surround the small camp there,

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
they're about to lose.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.496 align:middle line:84%
Like "Rocky," you know, at
the end, he's about to lose.

00:19:05.496 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, of
course, Frodo's successful,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.828 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you see
that look on Gandalf's face,

00:19:09.828 --> 00:19:12.819 align:middle line:84%
that his gambit paid
off, and it worked.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this
scene is so significant

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
is because as you mentioned,
it operates on so many levels.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I think what we have happening
on the spiritual plane

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
with the character
Sauron basically

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%
wanting a total domination
and control, right?

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
When Saruman possesses the
King of Rohan, it's possession.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:84%
He wants tyranny,
he wants domination,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:90%
and to stamp out freedom.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
spiritually-speaking

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
in our world politically,
socially, there

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
are forces that would seek
to dominate and control

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and to stamp out freedom.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.369 align:middle line:84%
And that NSA technology
of surveillance

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:84%
that is that all-seeing
eye in a real sense

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.536 align:middle line:84%
on our plane of reality,
it can be stamped down.

00:19:50.536 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I think eventually it will.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Because once we realize that
this stuff is anti-human

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's self-destructive,
it's going to fall.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I really literally
think that Tolkien

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.687 align:middle line:90%
is predicting the fall of this.

00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I do too.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I think he's, in the
end, he's an optimist.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's telling
us that, yes, you're

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be going through the
end of your own Fourth Age

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
probably, ye the
reader of these books.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, these
four little hobbits

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and really the whole
series is through the point

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.152 align:middle line:90%
of view of the four hobbits.

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:90%
They're in every scene.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
A hobbit is in every scene
except for the scenes

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
where Saruman is talking
in his castle keep.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're supposed to see

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
these events through
the hobbits' eyes,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:90%
because they're like children.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And Tolkien wants us to see
this whole thing through kind

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.302 align:middle line:90%
of the eyes of a child.

00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why the book
is masquerading

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:90%
as a children's book.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:20:43.855 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:84%
The cold, bleak forces of
tech cannot offer anything

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:90%
to the soul of man.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
All they can offer is
these petty promises

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of maybe a little bit longer
life, just like the ring.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.923 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the ring
has to be destroyed,

00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:90%
and I think ultimately it will.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
necessarily that we

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
have to be Luddites and
get rid of all technology

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:90%
or go back to some Stone Age.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But rather, that we're
going to wise up.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just
having better knowledge,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
actually have wisdom about
the way we use technology.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that is why this
next sequence, which I think

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
shows us the spiritual
message of the film in terms

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of humility and, as I said,
the David and Goliath,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:84%
the humility and
simplicity of life

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.825 align:middle line:84%
is actually what
overcomes this darkness.

00:21:22.825 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at "My
friends, you bow to no one."

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ARAGORN: My friends,
you bow to no one.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Very simply
put, it's really--

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just courage, bravery,
friendship, humility.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
These are the virtues
that will actually

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
topple the new world order.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:10%
They're the virtues that give
us courage in the face of death,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:10%
or whatever comes
our way, because we

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:10%
know it's not the end.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And we have certainty.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:90%
We have certitude.

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:84%
We have spiritual fulfillment
through the practice

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
of those virtues.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's those four hobbits
that are the only characters who

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:90%
could have saved Middle Earth.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.188 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's the message

00:22:05.188 --> 00:22:08.025 align:middle line:84%
that Tolkien's trying to send
us, is that it's the everyman.

00:22:08.025 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the everyday guy who, if
he can understand these things

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and practice
virtue, that will be

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the end of the spiritual
forces and death.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, the
little guy will win out

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
is what Tolkien is saying.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't mean the middle--

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.945 align:middle line:90%
or the working class.

00:22:21.945 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't mean
the working class.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about the humble.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think it can't
be underestimated,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
the sacrifice also
that Frodo and Sam make

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to get to Mount Doom, knowing
that there's no way out.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going there,
and then that's it.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no plan after they
throw the ring in the volcano.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself just shows
an amazing amount of courage

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to do that to save
the world and again, I

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
think we're all in this day
and age have to be Frodo.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:90%
We have to be brave.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to stand up to
the forces of darkness

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.979 align:middle line:84%
and do what we can to peacefully
dismantle the machine.

00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So my takeaway was,
as I said at the beginning,

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
these four levels
that really teach us

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:90%
important spiritual truths.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
You have the beginning
with this ancient history,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
this world 7,000 years ago that
may or may not have existed.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But regardless, at that
mythological, allegorical

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
level, we're learning
eternal perennial truths

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:84%
about good versus
evil, the overcoming

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of evil, spiritual
transformation.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:84%
There's also that
alchemical level

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
of where we see moral
messages through the victories

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of different characters.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf, you know, coming to a
higher spiritual consciousness.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have that prophetic
level where, I think,

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
he's telling us about our age,
our time, the end of our age,

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe even prophesying
things like 9/11

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or predicting things like the
military-industrial complex,

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:90%
the NSA, the ring of power.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately,
it will fall.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I also have a four
in my takeaway,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.501 align:middle line:90%
and that is the four ages.

00:23:58.501 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's really
definitely talking

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
about these four ages.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I think he believes
it very sincerely.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea that
there's a sharp end

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to an age and a sharp beginning
to an age, I find fascinating,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and I think that he
finds it fascinating.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in the
end, what he's saying

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we're ultimately
spiritual creatures,

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and we will defeat the
forces of materialism.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what
the dark forces are.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:90%
They're forces of materialism.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And when Saruman says, you
know, take down the trees,

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:90%
take them all down--

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.985 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: (DEEP VOICE)
Rip them all down.

00:24:35.985 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --that is the whole
message of the dark side.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Join us again next
time on "Hollywood Decoded."

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:42.459 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:24:42.459 --> 00:24:43.750 align:middle line:90%
