00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: In "Batman Begins",
we have basically a comic book

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:84%
tale that integrates some
conspiracy stories and Jungian

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:90%
archetypes.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
However, we divided
it up because we

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
thought that there was so
much in the first one, as well

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
as the progression
into a lot more complex

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and darker subjects
in two and three.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we're going to
see that Christopher Nolan is

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:84%
able to resolve this trilogy
in a very interesting way.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I agree.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And the Joker, which is the
second episode, "Dark Knight",

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the Joker plays
this character who

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
is the epitome of
chaos without reason.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:90%
He's not doing it for money.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
He's not doing it for any other
reason than to cause chaos.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
very interesting look

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
at the current state
of politics and anarchy

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and the advocacy of anarchy
that's going on in politics.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what Nolan is
saying is that we cannot let

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
these forces get out of control,
or we'll be in big trouble.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like the idea, as
we've said, of we're

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
all familiar with
methodical evil,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
planning and doing something
nefarious to get to an end

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%
result for some reason.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what we tend to
think of terrorism as,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
or the terrorist has some
goal to enact his manifesto

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But the Joker doesn't
have any manifestos.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
He's not a manifesto
kind of guy.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:90%
He's just completely chaotic.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's, I
think, a better villain

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.204 align:middle line:90%
than the Ra's al Ghul.

00:01:54.204 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think
he's a great villain,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and played to perfection
by Heath Ledger.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:10%
And I think also that this
famous scene in the movie where

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:10%
he's burning the money,
that kind of shows you, he

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:10%
doesn't care about
all his money.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Right.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: He'll douse it--

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And all the
other mob guys, he's

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:10%
with all the rest of
the mob of Gotham.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:90%
And they're like--

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They can't
believe what they're seeing.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: What are you doing?

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Are you burning this money?

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And he also is, in some ways,
knowledgeable about humans.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Like he knows that that one
guy is going to be a snitch.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, I recognize a
snitch when I see one.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:90%
And he's definitely a snitch.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A master of
human psychology.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: He is.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And the guy ends up
being the snitch.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And so again the Joker
has some kind of foresight

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.049 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of
the human condition.

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now this is
where we're going

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
to see the sage character,
Michael Caine, the Butler,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.054 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain this
idea to Bruce Wayne.

00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Wayne still
doesn't even get this,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:90%
that there's chaotic evil.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And he can't figure out
the Joker's modus operandi.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's
successful, the Joker,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
as a villain in this
film, for the most part,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.189 align:middle line:84%
is because there's
no pattern, they

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
can't figure out
why he's doing this.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:90%
What's he after?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:90%
What's he want?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's Michael Caine's
wisdom that says, you know,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
back when I was in
the military, we

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.835 align:middle line:90%
were out on whatever mission.

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING LIKE MICHAEL CAINE]
And some people

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
just like to see the
world burn, Master Wayne.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch that.

reasoned or negotiated with.

here.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:90%
He's not a person almost.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.067 align:middle line:84%
He's been almost completely--
he's lost his conscience,

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
he's almost possessed, in a way.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%

archetype, if you will.

>>WEIDNER: Well, he
is the apocalypse.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.072 align:middle line:84%
And again, Nolan uses
tarot cards in this movie.

00:03:57.072 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The Joker, of, course, is the
only tarot card that actually

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.862 align:middle line:90%
made it into our 52-card deck.

00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Playing cards, right.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Playing cards.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the only one
that made it over.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it's the fool.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:10%
The Joker is the fool.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:10%
And in the end of the movie when
he finally captures the Joker,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:10%
of course, he goes into
the hanging man pose, which

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:10%
is also from the tarot card.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:10%
But also in this movie,
which I really like,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:10%
is the Joker is
uncontrolled chaos.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to prove to
Batman, and to Gotham,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that he can take and turn
this place into chaos,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and the people will
willingly do it.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: But we
also have free choice.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And we choose, in the
movie they choose,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
no, we're not going to play
your manipulating game,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to kill each other

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
because you want us to do it.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.614 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't Batman
that stops the Joker,

00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
it's actually the
people of Gotham

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
who decide they're not going
to play the game anymore.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get that
duality where Nolan's always

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
playing with the idea of
black and white, good and evil

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that the Joker
tries to sell to Batman.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And you get the impression
for a couple of scenes

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that he almost kind of
convinces Bruce Wayne of this.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Because he's like,
you're more like me

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
than you are any of them.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We know what's going on.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.788 align:middle line:84%
We know how the
world really works.

00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:90%
We understand human psychology.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
The rest of these
people don't care.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They're willingly going along
with what I'm proposing,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:84%
all of my mass media
terror-- because he's

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
been sending these videos of
him threatening everybody.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the only one
that has any gumption

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to stand up against him, the
Joker argues, is his twin.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
He's like, you complete me.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like this Jerry
Maguire type moment,

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.472 align:middle line:84%
like you complete
me, or whatever.

00:05:43.472 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's watch that scene
where the Joker tries

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
to convince him.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:10%
but what I think almost
convinces Batman, maybe

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.040 align:middle line:10%
a little bit, is precisely
because in the secret society

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:10%
initiation that
Batman went through

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:10%
to become Batman, his alter ego,
he had to absorb the dark side.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:10%
He had to face up to his demons.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Now he's got a new demon he's
got to face up to, the Joker.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's thinking maybe, do I
have to also kind of integrate

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.952 align:middle line:90%
this chaotic evil into myself?

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:90%
But you can't really do that.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't integrate chaos into
your persona, I don't think.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.665 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I see these
two villains as the kind of--

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
if you go back to Nietzsche,
he wrote a famous work

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
on how there's
Apollonian religion

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.285 align:middle line:90%
and Dionysian religion.

00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And Apollonian religion
is characterized

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
by the sun and the logos
and reason and order.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
This is in Plato's
"Republic", essentially.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Dionysian religion
is just chaos.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like bombing your mind
on drugs and going nuts.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And Nietzsche saw these
two forces as always

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:90%
in competition.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we see in this
film is those two archetypes.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And then later, we're
introduced to Harvey Dent,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:90%
who is Two-Face.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get this duality
that Nolan is obsessed with,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the Joker and
Batman are two edges of--

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
two sides of the same coin.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And then Harvey
Dent actually does

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
get seduced by the
Joker's madness.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And then Batman has
to act as if he's

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
the bad guy in order
for Harvey Dent's memory

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to be remembered in a good
way, as not a bad man,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:90%
but a good man.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.024 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A lot of this film
deals with dissociation.

00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens to
Harvey Dent through his trauma.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think he loses his lover
and he's burned, and he's got--

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and he literally
has two pers-- he's

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:90%
a Jekyll-Hyde kind of thing.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at the
technocrats and the dark side

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.599 align:middle line:84%
and what they try to do through
the fear is cause dissociation.

00:08:16.599 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the Pentagon writers
actually talk about that.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.223 align:middle line:90%
Michael Aquino talks about that.

00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You cause dissociation in
the public through fear.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
theme of this series

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is overcoming fear through
integrating and/or opposing

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
or overcoming the dark
side of ourselves.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's not just
the bad guy out there, I think.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.612 align:middle line:84%
What Nolan's trying to tell us
is that just like Harvey Dent,

00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
we're all kind of Harvey
Dent's, in a way, because we

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:90%
have a dark side, too.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And are we going to let
that dark side rule us?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.806 align:middle line:84%
And again, is it Batman,
Bruce Wayne, Two-Face?

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:90%
You've got the Joker.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Who is the Joker?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Where did he come from?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't
really ever answer

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these questions.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But you can clearly see
that Bruce Wayne has become

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
more confident in
this show than,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in the second one, than
he was in the first.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
He's starting to kind
of take over things,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and he's starting
to show off, which

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Michael Caine, who's
really consciousness,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.379 align:middle line:84%
representing the
consciousness of Batman,

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
he says, you know,
you've got to pull back,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.607 align:middle line:90%
you're going too far.

00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the
third one, Michael Caine

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
cuts out completely because
Bruce Wayne's literally

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:90%
lost it.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to do anything
he can to stop Bane, the master

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
criminal.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in the
end, the Joker, he loses.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the humans in
Gotham do not play his game.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:10%
And again, that's that duality.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:10%
You're prisoners on these ships.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And he wants them
to kill each other.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And they won't do it.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And the lead prisoner is the
toughest alpha male of all,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:10%
he throws the bomb
out the window.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:10%
He says, I don't know why
you didn't do that earlier.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So even the criminals
have a consciousness

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:90%
that the Joker does not have.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Joker is so
outraged that his plan

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't work that he
becomes the hanging man.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're going
to look at this clip that

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
shows that duality with
Harvey Dent and Two-Face.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:35.728 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
clear presentation

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of the duality
symbolism, with the coin.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And we think of
Janus, right, Janus

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is the two-faced god, the god
of thresholds and doorways

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Romans, which would
signify that duality.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's just so
prevalent in this series

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that you can't escape
talking about it.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: No.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what the series is about
is Jungian archetypes of good

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and evil and darkness and light.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the alchemy
symbols are kind of

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the imagery
that Nolan is doing.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The [? negredo ?]
is the darkness.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And Batman is constantly
coming out of the darkness,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.920 align:middle line:90%
emerging out of darkness.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
He's playing with
visual archetypes

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
all through the series that
are really quite advanced.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what Christopher
Nolan's background is, as far

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
as how he began to understand
these psychological states.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.595 align:middle line:90%
But he clearly does.

00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's interesting
that he's the Dark Knight.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:90%
You mention that vigilantism.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- all of the main
characters end up being kind

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of vigilantes.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.874 align:middle line:90%
They're on their own.

00:11:35.874 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
They realize that the
system has sold them a lie.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not what it
pretended to be.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:90%
The cops are corrupt.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.797 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like the main
players are all on their own.

00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, they are.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
In the third one,
Commissioner Gordon,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
deliciously played
by Gary Oldman,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
that's what he has to do.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:84%
He has to not cooperate
with his own police force

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:84%
because he can't
trust anybody anymore.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And he has that
great line, "You're

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
a detective now, there's no
such things as coincidences."

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
is exactly right.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
There really is no such
thing as a coincidence.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.224 align:middle line:84%
If something happens, it
happened for a reason.

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, look
at Harvey Dent.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.431 align:middle line:84%
I think wasn't he
running for commissioner?

00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So he had some political
role he was trying to get.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:90%
And he's corrupted.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you have this
visual marring of his visage

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that I think is symbolic for,
every area and layer of Gotham

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
is in some way
kind of blackmailed

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
or corrupted or co-opted.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
battle between the Joker,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:84%
the vigilante over
here, and Batman,

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the vigilante over here, for
the heart and soul of Gotham.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's all an allegory
for modern civilization,

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:84%
for all of us, and
for individuals,

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and which way are we
going to go with our life.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And Harvey Dent
also, when he first

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:84%
introduced to Bruce
Wayne, he's clearly

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
implying that he
wants vigilantism.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can see Bruce Wayne
kind of going, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I like this guy.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But he's a politician, which
means he's a two-faced guy.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's what that all means.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.765 align:middle line:84%
So at the end, he becomes
the evil that he always was.

00:13:11.765 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think being two-faced,
that's a great archetype

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.605 align:middle line:90%
for a politician.

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's great.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.424 align:middle line:84%
You know, on the way here,
I was reading two books.

00:13:18.424 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
One on, like I said,
Stanislavski's method acting,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and another book on
surrealism and film.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And many of the early
surrealists actually said--

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think Nolan is influenced
by both noir and surrealism--

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and the surrealism
is the dream state.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.637 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Nolan is
constantly dealing with,

00:13:34.637 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
especially in movies
like "Inception",

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:90%
is the dream state.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But for people who are
victims of mind control,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
they talk about being
in a dream state.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And if they're drugged,
they're presumably

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
like they're in a dream state.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I bring that up
is that that is an undercurrent

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:90%
in Nolan's films.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I think he is speaking
directly to the subconscious.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.529 align:middle line:84%
He's, again, manipulating
the archetypes.

00:13:57.529 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying he's
doing it intentionally.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.236 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that the
archetypes he's using

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
are so powerful, like we said,
like Jack Nicholson warned

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Heath Ledger about the
Joker archetype, that's

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.453 align:middle line:84%
why they're in the tarot
deck, they're archetypes.

00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
They're so powerful that if you
present them in a certain way,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what you might
trigger, especially for people

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
out in the population that are
immersed in fantasy worlds.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
They've lost their identity and
connection to the real world,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to the here and the now.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
They completely live in video
games or something synthetic.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they can almost
unintentionally maybe

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
be programmed by
this kind of stuff.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I agree.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.265 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope that
Christopher Nolan would

00:14:34.265 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%
explore this in further films.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Because his filmmaking
is so powerful,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
his art form, he's
such a great artist.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:10%
And again, he's casting
this as a dream.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Batman only goes out at night,
when everybody's dreaming.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And he's a dreamlike
character, a scary character,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:90%
to criminals.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:10%
And he does that on purpose.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:10%
And he can come and go
at will, almost like he's

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:10%
a supernatural character.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is all being
consciously done by Nolan.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we lead into the third
of the series, the final,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:90%
we have the character Bane.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And Bane is this creature
from the underworld who comes

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
to the surface for revenge.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're never really
clear what the revenge is

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:90%
or why he's angry at the world.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But we find out that
Bane is not really

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
the villain of the
third installment.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really Marion Cotillard.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And she's playing
this person who

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
is only working for humanity.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And she wonders why Bruce
Wayne won't donate more money

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
to her cause and everything.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce Wayne takes
her in, only to find out

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.472 align:middle line:84%
that actually she's a super
villain who actually stabs him

00:15:47.472 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
in the back, literally.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Bane represents
syndicalism,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
eastern Marxist
communist syndicalism,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:90%
and even anarchism.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
That's his method.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:84%
He says that he's here to
destroy capitalism, destroy

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:84%
the West, to destroy
the stock market.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, he stages
that kind of false flag type

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:90%
event on the stock market.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he's going to bomb the
Super Bowl and all this kind

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:90%
of stuff.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So he's supposed to
be the representation

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of the terrorists,
of our darkest fears

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of some amorphous creature
out of the east who comes,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to destroy our
way of life, a bin Laden type

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But again, he's a
syndicalist, which

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is interesting
because Bruce Wayne is

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.122 align:middle line:90%
the anarcho-capitalist.

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the
anarcho-syndicalist.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And these are dialectics
that I think have actually

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.775 align:middle line:90%
been used in history.

00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:37.512 align:middle line:84%
They're not real battles
between two opposing forces.

00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
They are maybe at
the ground level.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But the foundations of the
people that control these two

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
movements, I think,
are also really run

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.867 align:middle line:90%
by big money and foundations.

00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, they are.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that he
does in the third episode,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Nolan does
in the third episode,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
is he presents a strangely
patriotic view of America.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the most
odd things, probably,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:10%
I've ever seen in
cinema in years,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:10%
in which he has the little
boy, before the Super Bowl,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:10%
sing the entire first verse
of the national anthem.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:10%
But he has a British accent.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:10%
So it's very odd
and disconcerting

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:10%
to hear a little
British kid singing

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:10%
the American national anthem.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it's
a football field

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:10%
and the players are
wearing opposite clothing.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:10%
And he blows up
the football field

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:10%
with the player running
away from the explosion.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And it's pure Americana
that Bane wishes to destroy.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's clearly anti-American,
anti-Gotham, in this state,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:90%
in this movie.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, this is almost a
patriotic homage to America,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:90%
in a weird way.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It is.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what Bane
says in his speech,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.411 align:middle line:90%
it actually kind of rings true.

00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like,
you know, maybe we

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
are given over to
consumerism and we

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
have no meaning in our
lives because everything

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.524 align:middle line:90%
is a commodity.

00:18:00.524 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But the character of
Bane is interesting

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
because he is at the
same level of Batman.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's only really Bane
who throughout the series

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.872 align:middle line:84%
says that, we are
both initiated.

00:18:13.872 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They're both part
of the same sect.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Because he was in Ra's
al Ghul's secret society.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So they're at the same
level, if you will,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of ritual initiation
or whatever.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Bane is the most
difficult villain for Batman

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to overcome, because it's really
the closest reflection to him.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Because Bane was in that
prison for a long time,

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that
Bruce Wayne's character

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
was in prison for a while
in the first installment.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look at that
clip now, we are initiated.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

But we are initiated,
aren't we, Bruce?

00:18:53.361 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:10%
You fight like a younger
man, with nothing held back.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:10%
It's admirable, but mistaken.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you think
darkness is your ally.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:10%
You merely adopted the dark.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:10%
I was born in it, molded by it.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:10%
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
By then it was nothing
to me but blinding!

[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So he
grew up in the dark.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So darkness can no longer affect
his fears, is what he's saying.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: He says,
you appropriated

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:90%
the light later in your life.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:90%
I was born in the dark.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:90%
It molded me.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So he is a creation of
the darkness itself.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
He wants to be the
embodiment, the incarnation

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
of the League of Shadows.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And he almost
succeeds in defeating Batman.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And Batman, of course, is
being initiated in this scene.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
He's starting to realize
that he's old, that he

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:90%
can't fight like he used to.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Bane brings that up.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:10%
And then Batman,
after this scene,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Batman descends
into his own hell

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:10%
realm, where he
goes to the prison

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:10%
that Bane had been in for years.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:10%
And then Batman goes
through his own initiation,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:10%
where he begins to realize
that he cannot defeat being

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:10%
physically, but he can become
strong psychologically and then

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:10%
defeat Bane with
psychological methods,

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:10%
plus his physical methods.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:10%
And he becomes
stronger and stronger,

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:10%
climbs out of the
hull, into the light,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:10%
and goes back to Gotham
for the final battle.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.022 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And here's the battle
of the two Ubermensches, right?

00:20:42.022 --> 00:20:43.605 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to be
the real Ubermensch?

00:20:43.605 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's, again,
the presentation

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of the Apollonian
and the Dionysian

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.095 align:middle line:90%
that we saw with the Joker.

00:20:49.095 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Bane is another
representation, in a way,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:90%
of that Dionysian side of being.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like he's not afraid
of anything dark or bad.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
He wants to be
beyond good and evil.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the great
dictum of Nietzsche.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so he argues that because
he is pure evil, pure blackness

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and darkness, he's beyond
the duality that's in Batman.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Because Batman still
has this conscience,

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
but he also has
integrated his dark side.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And it almost wins.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't succeed.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
I found really interesting

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.858 align:middle line:84%
about this film, that
most people didn't catch,

00:21:20.858 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
is that towards
the end, you'll see

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
there's a reading from
Charles Dickens, Two Cities,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%
"Tale of Two Cities".

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually about
the French Revolution.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So we know then that
Bane is supposed

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to represent
anarcho-syndicalism, which

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is set against, in a dialectic,
against anarcho-capitalism,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Wayne.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So I just found, again,
so many representations

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of duality and dialectical
tensions throughout the film.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:10%
But we do get the idea that
maybe Joseph Gordon-Levitt

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:10%
is now the new Batman, to
replace the aging Bruce

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Wayne as some sort of
dynastic succession, perhaps.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.890 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
that's the impression

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.181 align:middle line:10%
he leaves with you, that
that's what's going to happen.

00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up into
the manor there.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And it should be noted
that Michael Caine, who's

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
of Bruce, really,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:90%
he abandons him in this movie.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Because he thinks that
Wayne has gone-- or Batman

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
has gone way too far
into what he's doing

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and it will end
up destroying him.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:10%
And Batman fakes his death
to get out of being Batman,

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:10%
to get out of the
role of being Batman.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.355 align:middle line:10%
And I think there's a lot of
truth, especially in Hollywood,

00:22:26.355 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:10%
of people who've accepted
a deal with the devil

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:10%
and then fake their deaths
to get out of that deal.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And Batman is tired of it.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
He's had it.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
He gave over to this woman his
company, and she backstabs him.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
turned against him.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It's Batman against the world.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
In the whole movie, it's
Batman against the world,

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:90%
on the third installment.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
he's just had it.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to
leave and get out.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And he does.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The film shows
that, the whole series shows

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that in a profound way,
just how the entire city can

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
be controlled
through archetypes,

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and of course, maybe
a little chemical

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:90%
additive, too, to the side.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's really only the people
who've mastered the philosophy,

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher
kings-- here we're back

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.804 align:middle line:90%
to Plato's Republic--

00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and the heads of these
secret societies,

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Ra's al Ghul, Bane,
Batman, they are the ones

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
who understand the philosophy
that society is not moved

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.116 align:middle line:90%
by political causes really.

00:23:27.116 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's a lot
of political causes.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.057 align:middle line:84%
But the film shows those
to actually be fraudulent.

00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They are.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
They're facades.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.327 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You can't trust
those mass marketed

00:23:36.327 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
causes that are out there.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.159 align:middle line:84%
They're not really
there for your benefit.

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time those are
there for somebody else

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
using you as a tool, especially
in the political realm,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
with these political
revolutions and so forth.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have the
references all the way back

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
to the French Revolution,
which, I believe,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.294 align:middle line:84%
if you read Carroll
Quigley, his massive tome,

00:23:54.294 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
"Tragedy and Hope",
actually talks

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
about the French Revolution
being sparked by bankers.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.798 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, it was.

00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So again, we can't
trust those kind of ground level

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:90%
revolutions.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.446 align:middle line:84%
Even Bane himself, I
think, was probably

00:24:05.446 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:90%
in some degree manipulated.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Because Bane even says that
I am a creation of what

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:90%
you have done in the West.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
You Westerners, with your
capitalist imperialism,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
actually screwed up my
village and where I'm from.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And you created me.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
I am your dark side.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I've come to haunt you.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what Ra's al Ghul said,
I'm going to restore balance,

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you down
because you've become corrupt.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And I like the fact
that when Bane almost

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
succeeds in his revolution, he's
basically created this anarcho

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
revolution throughout
Gotham, it actually

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
makes Gotham worse than
before with Batman.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's that kind of
conservative element to it.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that
Nolan would put that in.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Because Bane almost wins.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And Batman has to face
the fact that even

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:90%
he was fooled by the politics.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
when he gives up.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I think when he kind of gives
up the ghost of the game right

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.155 align:middle line:84%
when he realizes that even he
can be fooled by these things.

00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: He realizes that
he would have become Bane.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
He was that close
to becoming-- very

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:90%
close to becoming the Joker.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.305 align:middle line:90%
Now he's close to becoming Bane.

00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They're from the
same secret society.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
He was going to be this
destroyer, because there's

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
the temptation that,
man, I'm trying

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to help all these people, just
like Socrates leaves the cave

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.307 align:middle line:84%
and he comes back, and when
he tries to enlighten them,

00:25:25.307 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:90%
they all want to kill him.

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.244 align:middle line:84%
So Bruce Wayne is
tempted with that.

00:25:28.244 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I
think he finally

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:10%
realizes that I've done
the good that I can do,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:10%
it's time for me to
retire and hand the baton

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.752 align:middle line:10%
on to Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

00:25:35.752 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: And then
there's a great scene

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:10%
where Anne Hathaway
and Bruce Wayne are

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.735 align:middle line:10%
dancing at this party.

00:25:41.735 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And Anne Hathaway is
explaining her motivations

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
about how you rich
live in your houses

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and you think the
societies can go on and on

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you'll be
the masters of it.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here to tell you that
there's another force at work

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:90%
here, and I support that force.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.624 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
you out, essentially, is

00:26:01.624 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:84%
what she's saying, we're going
to take all you rich people

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
story of this movie

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:84%
is the anarchic forces trying
to remove the wealthy people.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce Wayne is
not really defending--

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's like
occupy Wayne Manor.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It is,
occupy Wayne Manor.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And I really like the
Anne Hathaway character

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
in this movie.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I think she's great.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.281 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But it's just like
the French Revolution,

00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:84%
in that if you read the story
of what went down, Robespierre,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.097 align:middle line:84%
one of the main guys
early on, he's going

00:26:31.097 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:90%
to make everything better.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:84%
He's going to get rid
of those nasty rich guys

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to
make it all equal.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
You get committee
of public safety

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.947 align:middle line:84%
chopping off the heads of
tens of thousands of people.

00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bloodbath.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
happens with Bane.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.418 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right

00:26:44.418 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's a scene where
you actually see this kind

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
of Robespierrean image of this
guy at the top of this mountain

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:84%
of junk and trash, and he's
just up there like deciding who

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:90%
loses their head--

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Isn't that scarecrow?

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I think it is.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:10%
It's the Cillian
Murphy character.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.728 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: And it's
directly taken from--

00:26:58.728 --> 00:27:00.324 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: It's Robespierre.

00:27:00.324 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: He's Robespierre.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:10%
He's executing everyone
that's against him.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And exactly what happened
in the French Revolution.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And really, I think he evoked
kind of the freaky frightened,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:84%
the frightfulness, that being
in a helpless situation where

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
you plead guilty, you're
dead, you plead innocent,

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:90%
you're dead.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no way out.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And that really is what happened
in the French Revolution.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think
Nolan is afraid of that

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:90%
happening here in this country.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that that is the
explicit message of number

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
three is that we cannot
allow this kind of anarchy,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
this Robespierre type French
Revolution to come to this

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a warning.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a good warning.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.177 align:middle line:84%
Because we are veering
towards that kind of chaos,

00:27:46.177 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I think, in a lot of ways.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're the ones that
export color revolutions

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.698 align:middle line:90%
to all these other countries.

00:27:50.698 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're naive to think that
Bane's color revolution won't

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
come back on us.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he's trying to say.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
A very conservative
message, in a weird way.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
What you have to understand
is that Christopher Nolan's

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:90%
a dual citizen.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So he has got that kind of
love of America, I think,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that only a
foreigner could have.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh, then he comes here and all
the vibrancy that he sees here.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's
actually playing out

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
some of his own views,
points of view of America.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.877 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks maybe
we're a little bit

00:28:20.877 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:84%
like spoiled children
who really don't

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.074 align:middle line:90%
appreciate what we've got.

00:28:24.074 --> 00:28:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: My takeaway
is just simply

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that the trilogy is about
the individual taking

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for his
actions and not waiting

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:90%
for some external savior.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about growing past
childish political causes that

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:90%
are idealistic and not reality.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Nolan is telling us

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
be like Batman, we

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
have to be willing to undergo
our own initiation to where

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
we're not subjected to our
fears, we're beyond that,

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:90%
we can control ourselves.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Self-control is really
what this is about.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.959 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Batman
ends up retiring.

00:28:56.959 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think he's going to
have a good retirement,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.855 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:28:59.855 --> 00:29:01.271 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
he learned a lot.

00:29:01.271 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Learned a lot about the
human condition, which

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:90%
is really what initiation is.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's learning a lot
about who you really are

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and what the world
is really like.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in the, especially

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:84%
the third installment,
tired, old Batman

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:84%
realizes that actually
he can still be taken

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and that he's not the
man he thought he was.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And he grows from
that experience.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Accepting
the reality and not

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
falling into fantasy worlds and
being manipulated by illusions,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
is the positive take
away of this movie.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%

time on "Hollywood Decoded".
