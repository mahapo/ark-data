>>JAY DYER: Is there a
hidden, more esoteric,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.500 align:middle line:84%
deeper meaning to
the Hollywood films

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:90%
that we all love to watch?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner,

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:15.849 align:middle line:90%
and this is "Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.202 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Today
we're going to look

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:90%
at "Artificial Intelligence."

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
This is the retelling
of the Pinocchio story

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.357 align:middle line:84%
by Spielberg adapted from
the Stanley Kubrick script.

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
look at "Minority Report."

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
This is another
Spielberg film, this time

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
adapted from dystopian gnostic
writer, Philip K Dick, that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
pictures a future
when everything

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is tracked and traced.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, we know
that this was originally

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be a one-two punch
ending of Stanley Kubrick's

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:10%
He was going to put out
"Eyes Wide Shut" in 1999,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:10%
and then finish up on
the year of his most

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:10%
famous film, "2001," and he
was going to release "AI."

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been working
on it for years

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
with Ian Watson and various
other science fiction writers.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that Spielberg,
who was friends with Stanley,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:84%
was given the script
by Stanley to do,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
because Kubrick was very private
about everything that he did.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I do believe he did
give the script to Spielberg,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:90%
but just to get an opinion.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
have an insider,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:84%
who has told me what
Kubrick's script was going

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to be about on "AI," and we
got the results of Spielberg's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
"AI," which we're
going to discuss.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're completely
different films,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and I find it curious,
because as my insider told

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
me, when I was talking to him
in 2001, right after this film

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
came out, he told me,
what kind of person

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:84%
would really want to own a
perpetual 12-year-old boy

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:90%
or girl?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And would a mother
really want to have

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
a boy that never grows older,
never matures, never goes

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:90%
to college or gets married?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, no.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, that kind
of fits in a bookend way what

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:90%
"Eyes Wide Shut" is implying.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, wow, we
really missed a big one here

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
when Kubrick died in 1999
and did not get to make "AI."

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg's "AI" is a
very different film,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad that he made it,
because it gave me insights

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
into him, more
than anything else.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So "Artificial
Intelligence"

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
is operating just like "Blade
Runner" on many levels.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We have this fairy tale, and
fairy tales come up many times

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
in the film.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's not your
typical fairy tale.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Pinocchio.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a specific
reorganization and retelling

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:90%
of the gnostic mythology.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
Spielberg's penchant

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
with using Philip
K Dick, as we're

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
going to see in "Minority
Report," that he

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
has no problem with a
gnostic retelling of stories.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So what I see this as is,
basically, a combination,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
a coalescence of a whole
bunch of fairy tales

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
that tell the story
of transhumanism

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
repackaged, as we said,
from Pinocchio, and then

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in a weird way,
kind of dehumanizing

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.674 align:middle line:90%
humans and humanizing the bots.

00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to see, especially

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
when David is shown in his
Edenic state with his mom.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
He has this very perfect,
as we said, golden era,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
golden age fairy
tale primeval state,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and then he falls
into understanding

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
that the world is a mess.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:90%
The world is the flesh fair.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
Dante-esque inferno scene,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's
torturing the bots,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and Spielberg tries to
evoke that Holocaust imagery

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
with references to
the Holocaust by some

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of the bots in that scene.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And so then it takes us on this
long journey to Rouge City,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:10%
and then we experience the
baser desires of humanity

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:10%
with these entire
cities and buildings

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.504 align:middle line:10%
that are giant horrors
and strumpets bent over.

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going to
see all kinds of really

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
bizarre crazy things
in this movie,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes into aliens.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
So what do you think?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.316 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think
it's a number of things,

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things that
I'm going to keep coming back

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
to this theme throughout the
show that we do continuously,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and that is the process
of individuation.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And David, again, the robot,
he is asleep in a lot of ways.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't until
his mom leaves him,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
or she leaves him
out in the woods,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and then he begins that
Holocaust and that journey,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that he begins to realize
that he's an individual.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when he finally
meets the blue fairy,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
because he has a mission,
which none of the other robots

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
ever have, he has a mission to
see the blue fairy, which used

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:90%
to be a statue in Coney Island.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
But now it's under water.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And on the way, he
meets Dr. Hobby,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
who is, of course, the
alchemist who made him.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And we find out
that David is made

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
in the image of his lost
son, which, again, is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
a very kind of alchemist thing.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And David reacts in a way
like, no, I'm not just that.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than that.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he takes his
plunge into the water.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think this really is about
the process of individuation,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
which is why we like
these kinds of movies,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because we, ourselves,
in our lives,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
went through this same process.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
When we were young,
we were kind of

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
caught in the amorphous
thinking of teachers and family

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But as you mature, especially
when you hit your 20s,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:90%
you begin individuating.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
You begin, I'm the best sax
player in the neighborhood.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I can do math
better than anybody.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Saxodelic.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.607 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Saxodelic.

00:05:46.607 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
another thing that's

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
going on here, another
reason why we like the film.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
it is a nightmare.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So what we're
going to see in this scene

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:90%
is this imprinting protocol.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to mine a
lot of data out of this,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of really esoteric topics.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So if we look to the imprinting
protocol, we'll see that.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So I read this scene
cabalistically,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and I know that, because
Spielberg often uses

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
the cabalistic
mystical tradition out

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of medieval Judaism.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And what you have here
is a retelling, in a way,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:90%
of the Genesis narrative.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So God creates man in his image
and breathes life into him.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're told in Genesis
that that creation

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.276 align:middle line:84%
is done through some form
of verbal sound vibration.

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're familiar
with cymatics,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.931 align:middle line:84%
you get the idea of sound
imprinting its forms on nature.

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>Is it a game?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read some words,
and they won't make any sense,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to listen
to them anyway, and look

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:90%
at me all the time.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes, Monica.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in the same
way, these vowels,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
these sounds that Monica makes,
as his mother, as his mother

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
archetype, is what
actually awakens him.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.939 align:middle line:84%
And she actually-- you'll
notice on that diagram

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:90%
there were chakra points.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.771 align:middle line:84%
There was here and in
the back of his neck,

00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:84%
so you have these regions
or these zones that

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
are specific to the hermetic
tradition and so forth.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I read that as, like
you said, it is an awakening.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But it requires almost
a ritual process.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very strange
that we're seeing Mecha,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
as they're called
in the film, set

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.110 align:middle line:90%
against the Orga, the humanity.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it's science, it's
scientism, it's technology,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
but it still contains
that ritual magic aspect.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>Hurricane.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Dolphin.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.922 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.922 --> 00:07:40.722 align:middle line:90%
Tulip.

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Monica.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.588 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:48.388 align:middle line:90%
David.

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Monica.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.499 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if I did that right.

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.764 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>What were those
words for, Mommy?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.782 align:middle line:90%
>>What did you call me?

00:08:23.782 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>Mommy.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.734 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.734 --> 00:08:29.216 align:middle line:90%
>>Who am I, David?

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:33.662 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.662 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>You are my mommy.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think that
that's what David goes through

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
as he's searching for his
soul throughout the film,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and you're right.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
She did ignite him
in a way with words,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really even
understand the words

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.799 align:middle line:84%
that Spielberg is
even choosing here.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now another level that's
a little bit darker and more

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:84%
nefarious, something
similar to what

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
we saw in "Blade Runner" is
this idea of there being layers

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness and
that you could actually

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
tap into or control
how a person thinks

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
or their thought process and
maybe even implant new memories

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:90%
or erase memories.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is done through,
for example, hypnosis.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:10%
So the CIA did a lot of
studies into hypnosis,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:10%
and Dr. George Estabrooks
wrote a famous essay

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:10%
in "Science Digest"
back in 1971.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Hypnosis
Comes of Age,"

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about how he could
create a military courier, who

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.231 align:middle line:84%
could have alternate
personalities,

00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and then they could
send him on a mission.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And the only person
who could access

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
those memories suppressed
in an alternate personality

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
would be the person who had the
key codes or the trigger codes.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I read this as that,
in a way, relating to this,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to see Jude
Law's character is a sex bot.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:90%
He's a sex operative.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So yes, these are
bots, but you have

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it
operates on multiple levels.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So these people are being used
in an allegorical way for how

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the elite, how the establishment
uses people in Hollywood

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
and so forth as sex operatives.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: A lot of
this AI actually began

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
with those experiments in the
'50s and Jose Delgado stopping

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.835 align:middle line:90%
the bull with electrodes.

00:10:08.835 --> 00:10:09.752 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Electrodes.

00:10:09.752 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yep,
and so these things

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.501 align:middle line:90%
have been going on a long time.

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know Spielberg has to
be really into these things,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:90%
because we all are.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The trigger words
can do anything,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and I mean the robots can
be controlled from without.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:90%
They could be hacked.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.025 align:middle line:84%
Whoever's in control
is in control of them.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And from that
technocratic world view

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.274 align:middle line:84%
or that technocratic
perspective,

00:10:32.274 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
they view everything in a
naturalistic reductionist

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
So everything is material.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything is essentially a
giant program that's running,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and so really, programming
a bot or programming

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
a human is no different,
because they view us as bots.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They do.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Biological bots.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They do.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And they very much
view us that way.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it goes back
to "The Republic" by Plato,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
where he's just--

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.953 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Cybernetics.

00:10:55.953 --> 00:10:58.442 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, he's
designing this perfect society,

00:10:58.442 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
things that can't be

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
allowed in this perfect society
is any kind of individualism.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It has to be driven out, and
you can't think for yourself,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
because that would be dangerous.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get back to
those same themes here,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships between
Platonism and socialism

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:90%
are very close to each other.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
socialist countries

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
are very controlling
of how you think.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
That is the definition
of Stalinism,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.595 align:middle line:90%
is political thought control.

00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And actually,
what we're going to see

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.732 align:middle line:84%
is that Plato
talked about the way

00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that you could control the
masses through their baser

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:90%
desires.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we looked to the scene
about the flesh fair, what

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see is man's
baser desires, that temptation

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.454 align:middle line:84%
to lust and to
violence, being a means

00:11:41.454 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:90%
by which they're controlled.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.886 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very, as I
said, a Dante-esque scene.

00:11:44.886 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just like the inferno.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Very.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Very much.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.076 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But what's
going to happen

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is it's going to show that
contrast between the Orga

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Mecha, how the Orga
are captive to their desires.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
it's, I believe,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
a transhumanist fairytale
is that Spielberg

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.104 align:middle line:84%
is going to constantly
present the bots as superior.

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.894 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so if we
look at this scene here,

00:12:04.894 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:90%
we'll see that.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>What are you going
to do with him?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>Put him where he belongs--

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in show business.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>It was certainly my good
fortune running into you.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Gladitorial
events, dehumanization.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see this as,
but it's, again, the reversal.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the humans that
are de-humanized,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
because they're like
the pagans in Rome, who

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have these
giant gladiatorial events

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and torture people and see them
eaten by lions and so forth.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But here, David and Jude Law are
almost our new savior figures.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of-- they're the
beginnings of a new humanity is

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:90%
where this is going to take us.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.711 align:middle line:84%
But in Spielberg's
view, it's evolution,

00:12:45.711 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
so it's not really
humanity anymore.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:90%
We're post-human.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.616 align:middle line:84%
David is going to be the
founder of a new race,

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:90%
we're going to learn.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They're aliens, but they're
mechanized robotic aliens,

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
which is a very weird turn.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, hybrids almost.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And he goes out of his way to
make them look like aliens,

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but if you're listening and
watching the movie intently,

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that they're
actually a more advanced

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.636 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary form of David.

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls and children of all ages,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:90%
what will they think of next?

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
See here a bitty bot, a
tinker toy, a living doll.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we all know
why they made him--

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to speed your hearts, to
replace your children.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the latest
iteration in a series

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:90%
of insults to human dignity.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>And in the grand
scheme to phase out

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:90%
all of God's little children.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>Meet the next generation of
child designed to do just that.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Do not be fooled by the
artistry of this creation.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
No doubt, there was talent in
the crafting of this simulator,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
yet for the very
first strike, you

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:12.265 align:middle line:84%
will see the biggest lie come
apart before your very eyes.

00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:13.259 align:middle line:90%
>>Don't burn me!

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:15.247 align:middle line:90%
Don't burn me!

00:14:15.247 --> 00:14:17.235 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
[INAUDIBLE] you!

00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:18.229 align:middle line:90%
Don't make me die.

00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:19.223 align:middle line:90%
I'm David.

00:14:19.223 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm David.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So there's a scene
earlier in the film that really

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
comes to fruition in the flesh
fair scene, where David is set

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
up against his brother,
who's a human, who

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.419 align:middle line:84%
has like a wheelchair and
all this elaborate apparatus,

00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
because he can't get around,
because he's got something

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.793 align:middle line:90%
wrong with him, basically.

00:14:38.793 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And the guy is a total butthole.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:90%
He's awful.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And so he actually
torments David.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:84%
David is totally
cool, really nice

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.937 align:middle line:90%
to this rival kid, his brother.

00:14:49.937 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So we almost have this
Cain and Abel kind of story

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:90%
that's being retold.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We're getting the picture that
humans are basically the pits.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And then Monica has a
little bit of humanity,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
but she actually forfeits that,
because she just lets David--

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
like she leaves him,
just abandons him out in

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the wilderness.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he ends up
in the flesh fair,

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and we see this total contrast
between David and Jude Law.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Jude Law is a sex
operative, a sex bot.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't understand
what's going on here.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense to him.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this giant crowd

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
motivated and manipulated

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.322 align:middle line:84%
by their baser
desires, base emotions,

00:15:26.322 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
torture, they want

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to destroy these bots,
who have been humanized.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But when they finally
see that it's a child,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and they mistakenly think
that David is a kid,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.971 align:middle line:90%
because he says, "Don't burn me.

00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't burn me," they get
mad at Brendan Gleeson,

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and they throw the
bean bags at him.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.535 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
about that contrast?

00:15:44.535 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think that's
exactly what the movie's about.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And also, when his
brother tortures him,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the final torture
is throwing him

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.356 align:middle line:84%
into the pool, which is
where David ends up later.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Foreshadows, right?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.521 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly, which
is all done by, really,

00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
the cruelty of humans.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And so we
see this water motif

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
going through the
film also, where

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the more that David
interacts with water,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
the more his consciousness
seems to rise.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.086 align:middle line:84%
And we know that water is
symbolic for consciousness

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:90%
in the esoteric traditions.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now, on that
point, even Dr. Allen Hobby

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
is kind of a butt.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:90%
He is not a great guy.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.139 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: No, he's
not, not at all.

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:24.612 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And David
gets back to him,

00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Hobby basically doesn't
care what happens to David.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Does not care at all.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.225 align:middle line:84%
In fact, no humans
care about him at all.

00:16:30.225 --> 00:16:31.025 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:16:31.025 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Except for his
mom at the very beginning.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And even in the ending, where
the robot people in the future

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
bring her back for one day,
and typical Spielberg trying

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to find a happy
ending in this thing,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
even that, she's kind of odd
and strange and alienated,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's a very--

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: She's a holographic
recreation of a memory,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and she's just as vacant
as she was in real life.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
trying to say here.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Human beings are not that great.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
They almost deserve to get it,
and the robots are superior.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
So if we think, though, back
to that theme of everything

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:84%
being programmed and
mechanized, and what

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
we've noticed in the character
of David, as you said,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
is that he's achieved
self-actualization and free

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.799 align:middle line:84%
association, free thought,
free will, basically.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But the rest of
the people in the story--

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.074 align:middle line:84%
even Jude Law--
they don't really

00:17:25.074 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%
seem to have this free will.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:90%
They're all programmed.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Dr. No
is going to tell David

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
he's looking for,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
he can't answer his question,
because it's a flat fact.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And what David is trying
to do is associate things

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:84%
through archetypes
and through free will

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and through creativity.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And the robot that
he's talking to-- it's

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
a bot talking to a bot--
doesn't have that ability,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
so this is why David is
going to be the future is

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:90%
because he's not just a bot.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
He's a bot with free
will and creativity.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That is exactly it.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.395 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And we see that
in the "Dr. No" clip.

00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:00.412 align:middle line:90%
>>What if a fairy tale is real?

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:05.924 align:middle line:84%
Then wouldn't it be
fact, a flat fact?

00:18:05.924 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>Say no more.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:90%
New category, please.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Combine fact with fairy tale.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.926 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.926 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, ask him again.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>How can the blue fairy make
a robot into a real live boy?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:90%
[BUZZING]

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>Come away, oh, human child
to the waters and the wild,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
with a fairy hand in
hand, for the world's

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
more full of weeping
than you can understand.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Your quest will be perilous,
yet the reward is beyond price.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
In his book, "How Can
a Robot Become Human,"

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Professor Allen Hobby
writes of the power which

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:90%
will transform Mecha into Orga.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Will you tell me
how to find her?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Discovery is quite possible.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Our blue fairy does exist in
one place and in one place only.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.510 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the world
where the lions weep,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
here is the place
dreams are born.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Many a Mecha has gone
to the end of the world,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:90%
never to come back.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.814 align:middle line:84%
That is why they call the
end of the world "Manhattan."

00:19:53.814 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>And that's why
we must go there.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Post-humanity, the
end of the world, "Manhattan."

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yep.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And we
know that Manhattan

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:90%
has been completely destroyed.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It's flooded.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So what is fascinating about
this scene on many levels

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
is I noticed the
playing with language.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So Spielberg does this
a lot in his films,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and we mentioned earlier the
cabalistic ideas of Hebrew

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:84%
vowels and making something
come alive, a golem, basically,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.257 align:middle line:90%
with the imprinting protocol.

00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you've seen
"Close Encounters,"

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that whole film is
actually about language

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and communication.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:90%
So is "ET," by the way.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all about how do we
communicate across cultures,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
across spiritual boundaries
and planes, perhaps.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But in this, it's bots
communicating with bot.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I like that he combines
these seemingly two disparate

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
impossible categories of a
flat fact with a fairytale,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and this basically
melts down Google.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It goes into
shutdown mode, and it

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
triggers this alternate
program to come up

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that is the clue from Dr.
Hobby to lead David back

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to self-discovery, his
origins, his creator,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and, again, we're going to find
out that this human creator is

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:90%
less than ideal.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It was a test by Dr.
Hobby to find out

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:84%
which robot would figure out
its own sentience first and come

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:90%
back to meet its master.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, very close to
Decker in "Blade Runner"

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and various other films, too.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
the constant theme

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
within the alchemical myths
of creating life and having

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
it come back to its creator.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
In this instance,
Spielberg doesn't

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
have to kill its
creator, but it's still

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.204 align:middle line:90%
kind of an amazing scene.

00:21:36.204 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, when we think
about "Dante's Inferno,"

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
again, after this scene is when
David sinks into the water,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:90%
and he gets down to that abyss.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's Coney
Island, and he sees

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
this statue of,
basically, a Pinocchio

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:90%
setting, the blue fairy.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's frozen there for
millennia or eons, basically.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how long.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
What's weird about that is
that it's very similar, again,

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to "Dante's Inferno," because
at the pit, the very bottom

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of hell, it's frozen.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not lava.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pit of fire.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the devil,
basically, frozen in ice.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying that David
is necessarily the devil,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:84%
but he's an anti-hero
in a way, because he's

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:90%
frozen there for eons.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.311 align:middle line:84%
He's then awakened by his
progeny, who, as we said,

00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
eventually evolved
from him somehow.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's AI aliens, basically.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So "AI", I see it, as
I said, as a combining

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of a whole bunch of
fairy tales and mythology

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and meshing it with something
seemingly impossible

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to mesh with science
and technology.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The flat fact and the fairy tale
seem totally incommensurable,

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
but he's meshed them together
in a very fascinating,

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:90%
interesting way.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't like, necessarily,
the way the film ends.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.842 align:middle line:84%
But it is, basically, a
transhumanist fairy tale.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I think
it's very interesting,

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
because the next film
that we're going to watch,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:84%
"Minority Report," which
came out a year later,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
it has an ending very similar
to the ending of "AI,"

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
in that Spielberg is
weaving this fantasy in kind

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
of an attempt to have a
happy ending, no matter what.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:90%
So that will be interesting.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that next.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.932 align:middle line:90%
>>Boy.

00:23:23.932 --> 00:23:24.804 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:90%
This is Stanley Woodward.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:90%
He's from justice.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.925 align:middle line:84%
We're to get you
out of the farm.

00:23:27.925 --> 00:23:28.859 align:middle line:90%
>>I can't touch you.

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>Don't touch him or
anything else in here.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>He can't be in here.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>I understand.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Just answer his questions, and
we'll get the hell out of here.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>Tell me how--

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>Shh.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.365 align:middle line:90%
They're sleeping.

00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Sorry.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Tell me how all this works.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>The photon milk access
both the nutrient supply

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.069 align:middle line:84%
and a liquid conductor enhances
the images that each of them

00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
are seeing.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:90%
We call the female Agatha.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:90%
The twins are Arthur and Dasher.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.832 align:middle line:84%
You scan by way of
optical tomography.

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:56.219 align:middle line:84%
White light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length

00:23:56.219 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of the head here and are
re-read after absorption

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:90%
into their brain tissue.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.309 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
see what they see.

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel any pain.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We keep their heads
pretty well stocked

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:90%
with dopamine and endorphins.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we maintain
careful control

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:90%
over the serotonin levels.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't want them to drift
off into too deep a sleep.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They can't be kept
too awake either.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.413 align:middle line:84%
>>It's better if you don't
think of them as human.

00:24:20.413 --> 00:24:23.299 align:middle line:84%
>>No, they're much
more than that.

00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:26.666 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So hence, it's stolen
most of our miracles.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
In a way, they
give us hope, hope

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.429 align:middle line:90%
of the existence of the divine.

00:24:35.429 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting
that some people have

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:90%
begun to deify the precogs.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>Precogs are pattern
recognition filters.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.190 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Yet you call
this room a temple.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>Just a nickname.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>The Oracle is where
the power is anyway.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Power has always been
with the priests,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
even if they had to
invent the Oracle.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So here we have
a near-future dystopia,

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:84%
where crime has been completely
eliminated, we're told.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is done through
this advanced technology that

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
also uses precogs or people
who have premonitions

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think Spielberg
is, once again,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
meshing the fairy
tale or the religious

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
or the metaphysical with
science and technology

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.757 align:middle line:84%
in this weird dystopia that's,
again, from Philip K Dick.

00:25:16.757 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason Philip
K Dick is so important

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is that, as we said,
he was hanging out

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:90%
with the Silicon Valley elite.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
He was writing about the
internet back in "Ubik,"

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
decades ago before
the internet came out.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And so in all of these
stories that Dick is writing,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
he's presaging a dark
dystopian future.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And in "Minority Report,"
it's, once again,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:84%
this blending of the
religious into technocracy.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's called the temple.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
The temple is what houses this
almost trinitarian idea here

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of these three precognizant
individuals, who are predicting

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:90%
where crimes are going to be.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so this is, actually,
believe it or not,

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:90%
what Google is up to.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:90%
There are actual programs--

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
IBM, the CEO of
IBM, Ginni Rometty,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
has actually given lectures
about cities, smart cities

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
installing pre-crime.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's done through predictive
algorithms supposedly.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But in my view, I
mean this is just

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
a recipe for the
establishment to screw over

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.519 align:middle line:90%
whoever they want to.

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could
just say that, oh,

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you were going to commit
this crime tomorrow.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We knew you were going
to rob the 7-Eleven,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
so you're arrested, Jay.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.461 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: No, I think
that's exactly what it is.

00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I was struck by in
"Minority Report," besides some

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.026 align:middle line:84%
of the plot twists, is the
amount of predictiveness

00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that Spielberg has in it, the
things that we are taking for

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:84%
granted right now, which
in 2002, were unheard of,

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and yet, they're in the
film all through the film,

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
including they know who you are
when you walk into the grocery

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:90%
store or the department store.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:90%
They know what you want to buy.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
They know what kind
of clothes you want.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty shaky.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course,
with Google, you

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:84%
can say a word in your
office of a product

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.959 align:middle line:84%
that you're interested in,
and you open up your computer,

00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and they've already
heard it, processed it.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're getting cookies
downloading on whatever product

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about, not
searching for on Google,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
but literally talking when
you think the computer is off.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
happened to me recently.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.157 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing about
this movie that is amazing.

00:27:23.157 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, the predictive
programming is fascinating.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I usually say
that what you see in a film

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
is probably 15 to
20 years what you're

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:90%
going to see in the future.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So this was 2002,
and here we are now,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
targeted advertising is
coming into the market.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming the norm,
and we're actually

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:90%
going to see pre-crime.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There will be [? smart
? ] cities, pre-crime.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: There will.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee it.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.261 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So we're going to see
that targeted advertising based

00:27:48.261 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
on the total panopticism
here in this next clip.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.288 align:middle line:90%
>>A road diverges in the desert.

it is when I see the CEO of IBM
giving public lectures about

the future smart cities
like Rio and Singapore,

00:28:47.097 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and she says,
basically, there's going

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:10%
to be a giant AI

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:10%

be known about you.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%

>>WEIDNER: And I think
that's what Spielberg

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.484 align:middle line:84%
is trying to warn
us about here, is

00:29:30.484 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have no civil rights
when the technocrats build

they're out of control.

hey, what-- is this really
what you want to be doing here?

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And so there's no governance.

It's wild west, and
where they're headed,

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:90%
we don't even know.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%

that they're 40, 50 years ahead

whatever that means.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what 50
years from us in the future

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.970 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to have.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But I can imagine, and I
think Spielberg is giving us

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.959 align:middle line:84%
a real great display
of what we're

00:30:07.959 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
going to have to deal with
when we walk into department

00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It makes me think of
the voice to skull technology

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that DARPA developed back
even in the '80s and '90s,

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.859 align:middle line:84%
where they could actually target
your skull to hear that you

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%
need the Flaming Cheetos.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.891 align:middle line:84%
Or nobody else is hearing
this, and then people

00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:84%
are thinking you're crazy,
because you're here--

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing voices.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:27.939 align:middle line:90%
And what are they telling you?

00:30:27.939 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:90%
To buy the Cheetos.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.028 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Which is probably
what most channeling is,

00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:84%
is the CIA getting
in somebody's head.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's true.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.375 align:middle line:84%
Like "Real Genius," If
you've seen that movie.

00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:35.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, yeah.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.205 align:middle line:90%
Great movie, "Real Genius."

00:30:37.205 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But so another
interesting aspect to this film

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:90%
is drones.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really knew,
unless you were maybe

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:84%
working at the Air
Force, that there

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was going to be this big,
huge ordeal of drone warfare.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.765 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's commonplace.

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:52.306 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, the drones,
and we're going

00:30:52.306 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to drone attack all these Middle
Eastern countries and so forth.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knew about
drones, really, in 2002.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to see that,
again, predicted in this clip.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So just as we see
in "Blade Runner,"

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
there's the focus on
eyes and eye world,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's a unique
signature for who you are,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:90%
your identity, retinal scanning.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in this dystopia, once
again from Philip K Dick, just

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:84%
like "Blade Runner,"
he's concerned with eyes.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get your eyes
replaced in this dystopia,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
if you want to bypass
the jack-booted thugs who

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:90%
are coming for you.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, Tom Cruise's
character's wife

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.359 align:middle line:90%
uses an eye to get into the--

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Oh, that's right.

>>WEIDNER: --to the
jail to free him.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.265 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the eyes are a
big thing in this movie.

00:31:38.265 --> 00:31:39.598 align:middle line:90%
>>They're crying their eyes out.

00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:90%
They're terrified.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
terrified right now.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.485 align:middle line:84%

know terror, keep them away

very scary, actually.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Well, if we think about
panopticism and what it is,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.080 align:middle line:10%
this is the idea that comes
out of the 18th century

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:10%
with thinkers like
Jeremy Bentham,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:10%
and he wrote that
you could actually

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:10%
construct a prison with a giant
guard tower in the middle,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:10%
and you keep all of the prisoner
cells on the inside open.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And you don't let the prisoners
see when or if there are even

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:90%
guards in the tower.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So if people are
under the impression

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're always
being surveilled,

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
they self-police, and
they alter their behavior.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that was discovered
a long time ago,

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and it was called panopticism.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this is now
the term that's

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
used by philosophers like
Michel Foucault for how

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.780 align:middle line:84%
our system is based on NSA
mass surveillance and so forth.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
that even though there

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.634 align:middle line:84%
may not be a government
agent next to you

00:33:26.634 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:84%
watching you through a
window or on a computer

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.210 align:middle line:90%
or something like that--

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It doesn't matter.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --the idea of everybody
being under surveillance causes

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.355 align:middle line:84%
everybody to
self-police themselves.

00:33:34.355 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just find it
fascinating that this film

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
is dominated by the dystopian
notion of panopticism and total

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:90%
surveillance.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, again, this
goes back to Plato's "Republic"

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and how you would control the
population through these kinds

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:90%
of mechanisms.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think Philip K Dick
really saw through that.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: How we were
imprisoned by ideas

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
more than anything else.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big things
that people have criticized

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:84%
this movie for is the
absolutely absurd ending,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:84%
where everything
just suddenly begins

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:90%
going right for Tom Cruise.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
needs to be addressed,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
part of a sleight of hand

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.929 align:middle line:84%
by Spielberg, kind of an
interesting sleight of hand.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is that, what
I'm contending here,

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
is that everything that happens
after Tom Cruise is arrested

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
and put into that state is
his fantasy inside that state.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Everything begins going right.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:90%
The bad guy gets caught.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:84%
He's embarrassed in
front of his friends.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.400 align:middle line:84%
His wife frees him, and
the whole scene is actually

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.989 align:middle line:90%
so absurd, and it's not real.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:84%
What I'm contending is that
the last half hour the movie

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
is Tom Cruise's fantasy,
while he's been imprisoned.

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And the guard tells him that
you're not asleep in there.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.721 align:middle line:90%
He says, you're still active.

00:34:48.721 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
Things are still
going on in there.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't for a second think
that you're just going

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.139 align:middle line:90%
to fall into a dreamlike state.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
is what's going on here.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's very Philip K
Dickian in that the character

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
suddenly takes a
right turn, goes off

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
into a completely
other universe.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:84%
This universe, of course,
is where everything

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
starts going right, after a full
hour and a half of everything

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:90%
going wrong.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And Samantha Morton
ends up at this nice little cozy

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:84%
cottage, and she just has
books that she can read.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Everything
is perfect.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.928 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Everything's perfect.

00:35:17.928 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I think you're absolutely
right, and oddly enough,

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
there's another film
where Tom Cruise undergoes

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that exact same thing
called "Vanilla Sky--"

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Great film.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --where we discover
that he's actually been

00:35:27.915 --> 00:35:31.102 align:middle line:90%
in cryogenesis for his entire--

00:35:31.102 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:90%
we don't know how long.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:90%
It's centuries into the future.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a juxtaposition
between everything going bad,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and when he's put into
that stasis or cryogenesis

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, it's all
some sort of mental phantasm.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
would understand

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the movie a lot better
once you understand that.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in my view, "Minority
Report" is Philip K Dick,

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
again, talking to people
from Silicon Valley back

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:90%
in the day-- '60s, '70s--

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and knowing where they
were going to take things.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even 50 years
ahead of time,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
because what we see in this
film, even though it's what--

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.010 align:middle line:90%
15, 17 years ago?

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Philip K Dick was
telling us stuff

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:90%
that is still yet to come.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean the smart cities have not
even been put into place yet,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:84%
so I see this as
yet another warning

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:90%
of the dangers of technology.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean it can be a great
thing, but they can also

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.590 align:middle line:84%
really imprison us, not so much
through some actual government

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
agent, but as we said,
the power of the ideas

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.215 align:middle line:84%
behind mass surveillance
and panopticism.

00:36:30.215 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, I do believe
that this is both a warning

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.334 align:middle line:84%
from Spielberg and Dick
about where we're headed,

00:36:35.334 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and we better think about
what's going on here

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:84%
real fast, because this world
is coming at us like a freight

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:90%
train.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.557 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's
nobody watching the gate.

00:36:43.557 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Join us again next
time for "Hollywood Decoded."

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.111 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:36:48.111 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
