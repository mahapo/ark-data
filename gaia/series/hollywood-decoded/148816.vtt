00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Terminator" series is
one of the most fascinating

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:84%
examples of predictive
programming,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
especially when we think about
the fact that it premiered

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
And what's neat about that is
that most people in the '80s

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.724 align:middle line:10%
had not really had this idea of
an internet or what was coming.

00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you worked in
government or something

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
like that at some
sort of secret base,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
you knew about the experiments
and-- and data transmissions

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.556 align:middle line:90%
that ARPANET had done.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't know about this
coming internet that would

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:90%
really change the entire world.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
However, there were a lot
of films, and in particular,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
the "Terminator" series,
which encapsulated

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
this prediction of a coming
not just interlinked computer

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
network, but the
actual idea of AI

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in a giant space-based
Skynet network.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we had in
the "Terminator" series.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Skynet is the bad guy,
I guess you could say,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:90%
in the series.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And it directs the terminators
to go do its will on Earth,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
to kill the rebels
and things like that.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea, though,
that a guy from Canada

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
can come down to the United
States and be a truck driver

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and work at a drugstore
like James Cameron

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
did and then one day come up
with this idea for a script.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he, you
know, then he insists

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that he directs it even though
he has really no filmmaking

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
background at all.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
then, you know,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:90%
he does a pretty good job.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:90%
And then, it becomes a huge hit.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:10%
The whole thing just
seems dubious to me.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.532 align:middle line:84%
As far as my own
experiences in Hollywood,

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you really have to
work your way up

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:90%
or you have to know somebody.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And clearly he did neither.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he did work for
Roger Corman for a while,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
but not really long enough
to gain a lot of contacts.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know what
his background really is.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I--I suspect that
there's more to it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
He comes from the
Camerons of Canada,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
which are a very prominent
family in Canada.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We have Ewan Cameron running
the mind control experiments out

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:90%
of Montreal.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We have Marjorie Cameron, who
is the wife of Jack Parsons.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:90%
She is also from Canada.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- the whole
thing seemed dubious.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if he doesn't
have a background connected

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:90%
to DARPA.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he is a smart guy, and
he wouldn't make a big show out

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that there are
other Camerons associated

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
with intel and things
like that makes

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
me wonder if there
isn't something more

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:90%
to James Cameron.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> But.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:10%
The great thing is
is that he starts out

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:10%
the series with a flash-bang
B-movie action film.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:10%
And then he-- he in the next
film starts getting in to what

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:10%
the implications of this AI--

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:10%
and it is for all of humanity.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of the
series really drills down deep

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's kind of what
we want to explore in this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:10%
I see something very
analogous to what we

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:10%
discussed with Philip K. Dick.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:10%
I think that James
Cameron had to have

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:10%
had some kind of connection,
some kind of inside link

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:10%
to what Silicon Valley, what
Stanford Research Institute was

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:10%
up to in the process of
creating the internet.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the internet
comes out of the '60s.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, but by the '80s,
it's obviously being more--

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot more advanced.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.297 align:middle line:84%
And you have in the late
'70s Reagan and Star Wars

00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Defense Initiative saying that
we're going to weaponize space.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole principle
behind this whole-- this move,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
that-- that--
everything that changes

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
from the '70s into
the '80s based

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:90%
around space-based weapons.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of stuff was
happening in the early '80s.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:90%
We have-- we know from--

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
from our insiders that the
Secret Space Program really

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
took off.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And they developed these
really new technologies

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that Reagan talks about in
his diary about ships that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.877 align:middle line:90%
can take 300 people into space.

00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thought he was
a whack job when he said it,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:90%
but actually, he wasn't.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And also, CIA is really
basically infiltrating

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood at this point.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.691 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
point about Cameron.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got to wonder
what's going on here.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
the "Terminator"--

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
the first two-- were the
deepest, darkest fears

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of the people that were
working inside DARPA.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They've taken,
extrapolated their ideas

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
end, and they were

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:90%
realizing where this was going.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Because early as the early
'80s, I think that-- that--

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
they-- you know, they Cameron,
this is not a good thing that

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:90%
we're building here.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And we need to warn the world.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I
think is going on.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So here, we're going
to move to "Terminator 2,"

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because "Terminator" one
basically just sets the stage

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:90%
for the storyline.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we--we get into
the real heavy stuff in 2

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and in the rest of the sequels.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here
is Skynet basically

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
sets a date for the apocalypse.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And the way I read a lot of
this is that it's going to be,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
essentially, a kind of
psychological warfare.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think that we're
about to see the apocalypse.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the Pentagon,
military-industrial complex

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
likes to play with the idea
that the apocalypse could

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.266 align:middle line:84%
be at any moment and the
fear that that causes.

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
idea is really out

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Cold War and
mutually-assured destruction

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and that the Soviets are going
to nuke us at any moment.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And get under your desk, right?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.585 align:middle line:84%
Which makes no sense, because if
a nuke blast is coming, right,

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
like what is the
desk going to do?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So then, you're just going
to melt under the desk

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
instead of on top of
the desk or something.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
So I think that it's--

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
on one level, it's kind
of psychological warfare

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:90%
for the public.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that
it's telling us more

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.151 align:middle line:90%
about philosophical questions.

00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The series is going
to ask questions

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.329 align:middle line:84%
about predestination,
predetermined futures,

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and whether there is free will.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, bots
don't have free will.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be in the dialogue

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
with John Connor and
Arnold, the Terminator.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And time loops also.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And time loops.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.809 align:middle line:84%
>> How you get-- get
caught in time loops.

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And the future becomes the past.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Which was big in the '80s.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.457 align:middle line:84%
The '80s were obsessed with
time loops or something.

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at
here is Skynet setting

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:90%
the date for the attacks, 1984.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The computer which
controlled the machines, Skynet,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:10%
sent two terminators
back through time.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:10%
Their mission?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:10%
To destroy the leader
of the human resistance,

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.118 align:middle line:10%
John Connor, my son.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:10%


00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:10%
The first terminator
was programmed

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:10%
to strike at me in the year
1984, before John was born.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:10%
It failed.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:10%
The second was set to
strike at John himself

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:10%
when he was still a child.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.129 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we have a kind
of playing with, again,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:90%
the Christ mythos.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
If you remember from
part one, there's

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
a semi-miraculous birth for
this character of John Connor.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to be the,
sort of, human savior.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But the salvation is not from
some sort of external threat

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
or eternal damnation.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Here it's the salvation
from time itself.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Once again, this is the kind of
ever present theme in science

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
fiction, is that we're doomed
to repeat these loops--

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
eternal return that
Nietzsche talked about.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, John Connor is
basically the human savior.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
He's got to free us from
this pre-determined nuclear

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:90%
apocalypse.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're
looking at in this clip

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
is that Skynet has
basically become self-aware.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the giant AI program
that-- that basically

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
runs the planet in
the dystopian future.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.979 align:middle line:84%
So how can we get free from
this pre-determined time loop?

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they never really
answered the question,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.686 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think
you can answer it.

00:07:36.686 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's such a mind
screw, this whole the God--

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
the grandfather
complex, I think it's

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
called, where you go back
and kill your grandfather

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, stop
him from being born.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So how did you do
it to begin with?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And Cameron and all
the other filmmakers

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
really want to play with
this, and it is a great idea.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's face it.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a great science
fiction idea,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and they play it
to the hilt here.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But what I like
about this clip is

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're kind
of showing that we

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
to rebel physically

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
against this AI
that's coming at us.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:90%
And I actually have--

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
very familiar with technocracy
and the coming technocracy.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.135 align:middle line:84%
And I-- these guys
are out of control.

00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're building stuff,
and no one is watching.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really kind of
worried about what I'm seeing.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And I talk to people--

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, futurists
and things-- and they

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
don't really care about what
effects these inventions are

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
going to have on all of us.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
And we're really heading
towards a kind of a surveillance

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.369 align:middle line:84%
nightmare, in which our own TVs
and computers are watching us.

00:08:40.369 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And when they do
build the terminator,

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
which they are
working on, trust me.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
In these agencies within the
Black Ops and the military,

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:90%
they're working on terminators.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:90%
They will be out.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
There will be terminator
cops and terminator soldiers,

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and terminator wars,
and the whole thing.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're already
releasing AI police bots

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in select cities,
like San Francisco,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.622 align:middle line:90%
just to try to test them out--

00:09:03.622 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:90%
out there where Google is.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
amazing is that again--

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:84%
not so much the time loop stuff,
like you said-- but more so

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
what the series is telling
us about the Pentagon

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.190 align:middle line:90%
and the future.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
And it is technocracy.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back and you
read the technocrats from

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.229 align:middle line:84%
a hundred years ago, like H.G.
Wells or Bertrand Russell,

00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bertrand Russell wrote
a famous book called "Impact

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.327 align:middle line:90%
of Science on Society" and he--

00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
another one called "The
Scientific Outlook."

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a great book.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And in both of those, he
says that the future will be

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:90%
a technocracy.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We will be ruled by,
essentially, some sort-- sort

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:90%
of logical computing machines.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll have credits that
are put onto our accounts.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We won't have
actual cash or gold.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:90%
All that will be done away with.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And it will all be run
from a centralized grid.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And every area of
life will be managed.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It's what's called the
"managerial society."

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.764 align:middle line:90%
>> And so absolutely.

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That's-- and that's
why it's a dystopia.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate
that there is still

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
in this series the
notion of human free will

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and-- and rebellion
against this tyranny.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And we could see it happening
even right now around us.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, the major
huge corporations--

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:10%
Google, Facebook, Apple--

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.862 align:middle line:84%
>> --these guys aren't
going to be broken up.

00:10:09.862 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to be, you know--

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
their power is going to
increase and increase.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And Google right now has 86% of
all the traffic coming through.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through Google.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.619 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a group
mind that Google is building.

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, what's
amazing-- yeah,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
well the global brain is
the actual plan of Google

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:90%
and the Pentagon.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And what's also revelatory
here is the mass depopulation

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:90%
agenda.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's-- we
can set aside the fears

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:90%
of the apocalypse.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
going on in this movie

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is that the AI is there
to ensure the stamping out

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Bertrand Russell says
that the human will,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the human spirit has
to be stamped out.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.805 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they see the--

00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:90%
the machines doing.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, the real technocrats
from 100 years ago saw that.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
Skynet's there for is

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that-- that the
human population doesn't just

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
reduce down to 500 million, like
the Georgia Guidestones say,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
but actually down to zero.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.069 align:middle line:90%
And that's the real future here.

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's an interesting point.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't thought about
that, that the Georgia

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Guidestones might be like a--

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.315 align:middle line:84%
>> That's too high
of a tally for it.

00:11:13.315 --> 00:11:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --running interference
for the real thing,

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:90%
which is zero population.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's very-- it's just very
interesting because the way

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that these AI programs are
working is is, that they're--

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:90%
they're individuating us.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:10%
They say, oh, you know, Jay
Dyer likes this and that,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:10%
and this movie and that book.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting flashed
with all the things

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that you-- they think you like.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You can disrupt
the system quickly

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
by going to something completely
opposite of your other choices.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't
figured that one out.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.607 align:middle line:84%
We're slowly going
towards a world--

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's not slowly.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's actually quickly
going to a world

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:53.305 align:middle line:84%
where when you enter
a room, the thermostat

00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:55.625 align:middle line:84%
is going to immediately
heat that room up to 70.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when you leave the
room, it's going to turn off.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's going to be
watching everything you do,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
everywhere you go.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be measuring,
you're using too much gasoline.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:90%
You're using--

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:10%
>> --too much energy
in your house.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:90%
You need to cut back.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They're going to shame you
by telling your neighbors how

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.740 align:middle line:84%
much you're spending on hot
water and air conditioning.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.587 align:middle line:90%
And this is where we're going.

00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It's already happening in
some very liberal cities

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
The smart city.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> The smart city, yeah.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.856 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what we get
by the end of this series,

00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is this giant smart city,
which is where Skynet lives.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So the-- I think the perennial
themes of this series

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.899 align:middle line:90%
are very important.

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's all the stuff
that we mentioned.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But we have to also
understand that,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.707 align:middle line:84%
how does the series present
us getting to this point?

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to do that
in this next clip, where

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
it raises the question of fate.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
tech-- technocracy--

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:84%
the operating system that
technocracy runs on is that

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
there's no free will, that
everything is literally

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.499 align:middle line:84%
deterministic causal chains
that-- that cannot be broken.

00:12:53.499 --> 00:12:55.165 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to look at "No Fate."

00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:58.759 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:10%
>> No fate.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.525 align:middle line:10%
No fate but what we make.

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:10%


00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
My father told her this.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I made him memorize it
up in the future as a message

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:10%
to her.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:10%
Never mind.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, OK.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:10%
The whole thing goes,
"The future's not set.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:10%
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves."

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:10%
>> She intends to
change the future?

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I guess.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.187 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's a fascinating
question because what

00:13:38.187 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at here is
basically the mechanistic

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
idea, a way to read

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
the world, a picture
of the world that

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
has dominated since the time
of the scientific revolution

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:90%
and Descartes.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the history of Western
philosophy and thought, ever

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
since that revolution,
the world has been viewed

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:90%
as a giant kind of machine.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big clock
that's kind of wound up,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's just kind
of ticking down.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so in that view, everything
has its pre-determined causal

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
chain that makes it what it
is, and you can't really escape

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that flat sort of, you know,
extended, determined future.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just there for you.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:90%
It's made for you.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no way out of it.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the dictum that--
that John Connor has learned

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is that no fate
but what we make.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so he represents
kind of the human spirit

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas of
transcending this merely,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you know,
materialistic-determined

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
circle, this Nietzschean
eternal return

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
that we can never escape from.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The scientists actually
really believe that we live

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
in this mechanical universe.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
Plato's "Republic,"

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, on steroids,
where they're

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
using the machines to
make sure that everybody

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is tightly controlled,
and the society

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:90%
is going towards this place.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But we have nothing
to say about it.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And only the rich elites seem
to have the say about it.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we really
have to be cognizant of that,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because that is the most
dangerous place that we can go.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what this
series is trying to say,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're heading towards
a very dangerous place here.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
lose our free will.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, you know,
we have to also ask,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%
do we really have free will?

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
Daniel Dennett, who's

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
a famous computer
scientist from MIT,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and he writes a lot on
atheism and on the fact

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:90%
that there's no human will.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all illusory.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
The irony here is that when
he's asked and pressed about

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.071 align:middle line:84%
whether or not he really
wrote his books, you know,

00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:90%
he tends to think that he did.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, Bertrand
Russell 100 years ago said

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.061 align:middle line:84%
that we have to stamp out the
human will and human spirit,

00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting,
because I thought there is

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:90%
no human will and human spirit.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have to
stamp something out

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't exist?

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Really good point.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
like you're saying--

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
they know that it does exist.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But they're afraid
of that, and that's

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
why they have to press it
down, you know, stamp it out,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and try to control it.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So ultimately, these films
are--are optimistic in that

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:90%
we--

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>> --are rebelling.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.939 align:middle line:84%
And we can stop this
thing from happening,

00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
which is going to crush all
of us if we're not careful.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that's another point
the movie is trying to make.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the series gets a little
bizarre, and it, you know,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.706 align:middle line:84%
goes off in these
various directions.

00:16:09.706 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So by the time of
"Terminator 3,"

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get some
new mythological concepts

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
introduced.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.795 align:middle line:84%
You know, we already
had the terminator

00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of Christ figure,
a mechanistic Christ figure,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:84%
along with John Connor
as a kind of Christ

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
figure in the first
two installments.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But here, we're going to look
at the possibility of John

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Connor as an Orpheus and what
exactly Skynet's relationship

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.635 align:middle line:90%
is to mass viruses.

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, could
the establishment

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
stage a giant cyber
attack, you know,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that could lead to some sort of
global government or something

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at Skynet is an--

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
is an AI cyber
threat virus killer.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, what do we got?

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:10%
>> This new computer
virus is a tricky bastard.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:10%
It's infected half of
the civilian internet

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.234 align:middle line:10%
as well as secondary military
apps, payroll inventory.

00:16:54.234 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Primary defense
nets are still clean?

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.359 align:middle line:10%
>> So far, the firewalls
are holding up.

00:16:58.359 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Sir, the Pentagon has
proposed that we use our AI

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:10%
to scan the entire
infrastructure,

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.789 align:middle line:10%
search and destroy for
any hint of the virus.

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:10%
>> I know Tony.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.129 align:middle line:10%
But that's going after
a fly with a bazooka.

00:17:08.129 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, once the
connection is made,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:10%
it should only be a
matter of minutes.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:10%
>> During which we've put
everything from satellites

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:10%
to missile silos under the
control of a single computer

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.169 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The most intelligent
system ever conceived.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.736 align:middle line:10%
>> I still prefer to
keep humans in the loop.

00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:24.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what's amazing
about this is this is 2003.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.634 align:middle line:84%
And if we look to the recent
Vault 7 Wikileaks leaks--

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at any of those,
if you went through those--

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
we saw that the CIA had the
ability through their own kind

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
of NSA that they
had set up to spoof

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
cyber attacks from other
countries that weren't really

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.734 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:17:42.734 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But it made it
look like they were

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:90%
coming from Russia or China.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.426 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially,
they had the ability

00:17:47.426 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to create cyber false flags.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We know that Stuxnet is
admittedly a cyber false flag.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here in the
film is this presentation

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of the cyber threat.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And then this self-adaptive
AI software, Skynet,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
is what's going to take
out this so-called threat.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But it actually adapts and sort
of comes alive, so to speak.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.396 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we get Skynet.

00:18:08.396 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of in that
contradiction.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It understand-- understood what
it was and became self-aware.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I was actually
grateful for that release--

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:10%
Vault 7 release.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:10%
Because it really is
a fact that the CIA

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:10%
can attack us from
any country on Earth,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:10%
and we can't trust
anything anymore.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
And I think that AI is--

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I think there is an AI
right now, actually,

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and they just haven't told us.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's-- they're
hooking it up very slowly so we

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:90%
don't see it.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But there clearly-- the
satellites are attached

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to the ground base, and all
attached to whatever systems--

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.021 align:middle line:84%
nuclear or regular weapon
systems that they have.

00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there is a lot more

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
cooperation at a higher
level between countries

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.414 align:middle line:90%
than we think.

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
there really is

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
nearly as much
tension between Russia

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
the United States as they're
trying to make it seem.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're all kind
of working together on this--

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese--

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
China, Russia-- and just
like in the movies--

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:90%
international.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Julian Assange said that
the internet itself is a giant

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:90%
spying apparatus.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.568 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the history of where

00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:14.735 align:middle line:90%
it comes from out of DARPA--

00:19:14.735 --> 00:19:15.534 align:middle line:90%
>> >> DARPA, yeah.

00:19:15.534 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --which was ARPANET,
right, back in the '60s.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It was created to be a
device for cryptography,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
for transmitting messages under
the aegis of the military.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is military
technology that's

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
been released to the public
and then to the whole world.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think would be very naive
to assume that, you know,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that the internet that China is
using or that Russia is using

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is not in some way, you
know, linked to our internet.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.396 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
you're right, that it's

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
kind of a theatrical
sort of chess game

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that's being played out.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But really, the end goal
is what we see in the film,

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
it's Skynet.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are also
ramifications that are unseen

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:90%
by the powers that be.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
like when Rome decided

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to conquer the world
2,000 years ago,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
they built roads everywhere
for their carriages

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and their chariots.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was all done
for warrior purposes,

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
just like the internet was
created for warrior purposes.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But the Christians
and the early Gnostics

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
used those roads to convert
people all over the place.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what's also
going on with the internet,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is people are using the
highways built by the military

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to actually go
against the military,

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
actually preach
against this thing.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is like
the unseen ramifications

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that John Connor is in
the "Terminator" series.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>> He's the unseen ramification.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Because he was educated
ahead of everybody about

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:90%
what was happening--

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --he began the rebellion.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a--
there's a good argument

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:43.351 align:middle line:84%
to say that there's
a rebellion going

00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
on within the intelligence
services and the military

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
against what we're going
through even right now,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:84%
people who are aware
of what's going on.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they don't like it.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.693 align:middle line:84%
So in this next scene,
what we're going to look at

00:20:54.693 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is the introduction of a
new level of mythology.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
know Greek history

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
Greek myths, then you

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
know that they were obsessed
with the notion of time.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And time, as I said, being
this kind of flat circle,

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:84%
it's embodied in
Achilles's shield

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.872 align:middle line:84%
in the "Iliad," that
the circle of time

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
just keeps going
around and around.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And they viewed it as--

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
they viewed time as cyclical.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So there's no way to escape it.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this mythology is
such a good analogy for what's

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
happening with John
Connor and his wife, Kate,

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:90%
in the third installment.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.915 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at John
Connor as Orpheus.

00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:32.064 align:middle line:10%
[CHOKING]

00:21:32.064 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:10%
>> You're right.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:10%
You're not the one I want.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.166 align:middle line:10%
I'm wasting my time.

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:41.396 align:middle line:10%
[CHOKING]

00:21:41.396 --> 00:21:45.335 align:middle line:10%
>> [BLEEP] you, you
[BLEEP] machine.

00:21:45.335 --> 00:21:46.766 align:middle line:10%
[THUD]

00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:49.628 align:middle line:10%
>> Better.

00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:50.582 align:middle line:10%
[CHOKING]

00:21:50.582 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:10%
>> You were just
dicking with me?

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Anger is more
useful than the spear.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:10%
>> What?

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.427 align:middle line:10%
>> Basic psychology is
among my subroutines.

00:22:00.427 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you noticed the
stained glass background,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:84%
there was a figure playing
a harp between two pillars.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, I've-- I read this
as the figure of Orpheus.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the Orpheus
mythology, he would

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:84%
have to descend
to the underworld

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve his wife.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And in this process is where he
discovers his own inner power

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and, so to speak, becomes
free from the cycle of time.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the-- part of
the Orpheus mythology.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So I saw that as very,
very relevant to what's

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:90%
happening in the film.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the third
installment is really

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
about trying to get
out of this time

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
loop of predestined
nuclear apocalypse.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And it requires,
basically, him finding

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:90%
his wife, Kate Brewster.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.749 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happens with Orpheus.

00:22:40.749 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that's a
very interesting observation.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.123 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't really seen that
before I read your notes

00:22:45.123 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%
on the "Terminator" series.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And it really makes sense
John Connor is Orpheus,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and he's coming back
from the underworld

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge now, and the
power, to defeat the machines.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's the central myth of
Greek mythology, really late--

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:90%
later--

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --Greek mythology-- a
very refined kind of man-god,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.101 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the earlier,
more primitive man-gods.

00:23:10.101 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's a
really good analogy, actually,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The Orphic myths are
also-- by a lot of respected

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
historians and
philosophers, you know,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that study Greek philosophy--

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
it's believed to be
behind Platonism as well.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.245 align:middle line:84%
There's a very Orphic
quality to a lot of--

00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
to Plato's thought.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Plato is very
much interested in transcending

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the here and the
now and getting to,

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.773 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ideal
realm, getting out

00:23:35.773 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:90%
of the prison of time.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So it relates to the,
you know, the allegory

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
of the cave that you
mentioned earlier.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So here, we're going to see
how it is and why it is that

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Skynet became self-aware and how
this really arose from the Cold

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
War, which is the actual history
of AI and Skynet in the real

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at that.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:10%
>> By the time Skynet
became self-aware,

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:10%
it had spread into millions
of computer servers across

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:10%
the planet--

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:10%
ordinary computers
and office buildings,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:10%
dorm rooms, everywhere.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:10%
It was software in cyberspace.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.406 align:middle line:10%
There was no system core.

00:24:17.406 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:10%
It could not be shut down.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:10%
The attack began at 6:18 PM,
just as he said it would,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:10%
Judgment Day.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So they weren't able to
stop the nuke apocalypse

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:90%
in the film.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's because Skynet was
not, at that time, centralized.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
software program

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that had gone out into all
the different motherboards

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So it was out there.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And it-- so it was
not in one place

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:90%
that you could get to to stop.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this kind
of, to me, roughly

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
brings to mind the idea of
the Promis software, which

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that a long time
ago, they had put back doors

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
into all computers and that
this is actually installed

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
at the hardware level
at the factories, which

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
makes a lot of the big companies
suspect themselves, right?

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:10%
Intel inside, right?

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence inside
your computer.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're getting
the kind of information

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
here that William Binney
talks about, the famous NSA

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
whistleblower, who
actually designed

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
the programs for the back doors
and the 3D modeling of all

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
of virtual reality and
so forth for the NSA.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And Edward Snowden, you
know, and his PRISM program

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.686 align:middle line:90%
that he talked about.

00:25:30.686 --> 00:25:31.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Danny Casolaro.

00:25:31.727 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Casolaro-- right.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
All those guys were finding
out that they were--

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
back in the '90s, they were
sticking trap door programs

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.947 align:middle line:84%
into every single
piece of software

00:25:40.947 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that was coming out
so that they could

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
get in anytime they wanted.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we now know
this is all true.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --you know, it
was just rumors then.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, James Bamford in 1983
wrote "The Puzzle Palace,"

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:90%
one of the first--

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Great book.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.979 align:middle line:84%
>> --one the first
books on the NSA.

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said back then that
they had this capability, which

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal to me.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I remember I
read that book back then,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and I was blown away by it.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I was really happy
with the "Terminator" series

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't go
full-bore B-movie,

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
that they kind of
started entertaining

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:90%
some of these higher ideas.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, they could have--
to be honest with you,

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:10%
it would have been
a much bigger hit--

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:10%
to have the terminators,
thousands of them,

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:10%
unleashed on humanity and just
have this B-movie massacre,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And they didn't.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.671 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was actually
kind of interesting that they

00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:90%
didn't resort to that.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They may in the
future, you know,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
because that would be
a terrifying movie.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But it would not be an
intellectually challenging

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:90%
movie.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.239 align:middle line:90%
It'd just be a horror film.

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:10%
And so I was kind of
glad that they kind of

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:10%
went into the more etheric
Skynet, the relationship

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:10%
between man and machine.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Free will, you know.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And free will.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a-- it's
a worthy series, I think,

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:90%
the whole series.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the more
recent installments,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
the second to last,
"Terminator Salvation,"

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
this is where Christian
Bale comes into the picture.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And we get the idea of the
Christ myth coming back,

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and we need a savior of, how are
we going to stop this Skynet?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And so here's where we
get the hybrid, the idea

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of the guy who's going to
bridge these two worlds,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.380 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Jesus is
both human and divine.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And he bridges this gap.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to get
the half-cyborg, half-human

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:90%
character here.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.135 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
"No Second Chances."

00:27:19.135 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Our best machines had failed
time and again to complete

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:22.850 align:middle line:10%
the mission.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:10%
Something was missing.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.146 align:middle line:10%
We had to think radically.

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:10%
And so we made you.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:10%
We created the perfect
infiltration machine.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:10%
You, Marcus, you
did what Skynet has

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.676 align:middle line:10%
failed to do for so many years.

00:27:39.676 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:10%
You killed John Connor.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's Sam Worthington
playing the savior once again,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the guy who bridges
these two worlds.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And we find out, interestingly,
that the weakness

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the terminators
was that they didn't

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
have empathy and human emotion.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.634 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand,
you know, how to--

00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to integrate that into
their attack pattern.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they create
this character

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that they think will
be kind of this spy

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to infiltrate the humans,
which is the same role that he

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:90%
plays--

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> In "Avatar."

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.627 align:middle line:90%
>> --in "Avatar," right?

00:28:10.627 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just that Cameron's
got a lot of these things

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:13.584 align:middle line:90%
on his mind, I guess.

00:28:13.584 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that
it's the reverse.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
He's actually-- because
he's this-- this bridge

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
between these two worlds
and he has free will because

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:84%
of his emotions and you
know, empathy, he's able

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.802 align:middle line:90%
to, therefore, defeat Skynet.

00:28:25.802 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It is kind of crazy how
close that is to "Avatar."

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] Right?

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, it's really crazy--

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
both Sam Worthington,
same year both films

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
came out, with
almost the same plot.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And Cameron had
influences on all that.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%
So it really makes you wonder.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, that was a great
ending to the series.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- I haven't
seen the new one yet.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:90%
So I can't comment on it.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that the ending
of that series was really good.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, really, the
best part of the new one--

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
it didn't do that
well critically.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
mediocre box office.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:10%
But the most relevant
aspect of the last one,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:10%
"Genesis," was that it was back
to the time loop narrative.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:10%
But what happened was
that they literally put,

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:10%
you know, our tech
devices that we all

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:10%
carry as the means by which the
awakening of Skynet happens.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually have all
of the humans opting into it.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
You have to opt into it, right?

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you opt into it, then
it sort of transfers the right

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
for Skynet to rule
over to this--

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
this ethereal AI entity.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And that seems to be also one
of the rules of the Illuminati,

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that they have to get
you to tacitly agree--

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --to their plan, or the
plan cannot be executed.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.084 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:29:43.084 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, these films are great.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, they're
well worth watching,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
all the way from
beginning to the end.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're advancing
a narrative that we all

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.120 align:middle line:90%
need to think about.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I see them, too,
as predecessors too a couple

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:90%
recent films--

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.240 align:middle line:84%
more recent films--
that are very important,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:90%
like "Ex Machina"--

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:10%
>> --and "Her," the
Spike Jones film.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:10%
>> "Her."

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Both of these contain
the same warning,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:10%
the same narrative or threat,
of everybody opting into this

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:10%
system through reliance and
being a slave to their tech

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:10%
devices, and that this will
actually have consequences

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:10%
in the future for our progeny.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I highly recommend "Her."

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
That is a great film,
no doubt about it.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> My final takeaway is that the
series is about human free will

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:90%
versus technocracy.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
overriding theme.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the third installment
and the fourth installment,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I think, explicitly make
reference to depopulation.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.352 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the plan of
the technocrats and their--

00:30:41.352 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
their evil offspring
and AI, right,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
being there to ensure that
depopulation takes place.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And so I see it as-- as that.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%
I see it as Platonic.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a kind
of Gnostic sort

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
of being outside of the
pre-determined limits

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and bounds of time through
some sort of rebellion

on the part of the human spirit.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:90%

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:90%
The demiurge is the Skynet.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:90%

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:90%

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
the rebellion among

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:84%

to it, a deep, dark warning
also about where we're headed,

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:90%
and just a great series.
