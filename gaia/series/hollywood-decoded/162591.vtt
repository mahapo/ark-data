00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY DYER: Is there
a deeper hidden, more

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.930 align:middle line:84%
esoteric meaning behind
the Hollywood films

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.160 align:middle line:90%
that we all love to watch?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.714 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:23.462 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: We chose "Star
Trek" because it initially

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
came out of the mind
of Gene Roddenberry.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:10%
And it was this whole idea
of the future of humanity

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:10%
as a peaceful,
spacefaring people

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:10%
with all races
included in his vision

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
and going around the
universe exploring.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I truly believe,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and I think Jay
agrees, is probably

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
the most hopeful future
for the human race.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think Roddenberry
was really presenting this

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and the '60s
generation, the boomers,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
just lapped it up and
became what it became today,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:90%
which is this huge phenomenon.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
What's was interesting
about "Star Trek"

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is that it did come from the
mind of Gene Roddenberry,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to have an earlier
fungal growth, you might say,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
in that Roddenberry was on
the set of the show "The Outer

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Limits" every day, according
to one of the sub-producers Tom

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Seldin.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:10%
And the producer of
the show "Outer Limits"

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
was Leslie Stevens,
Jr. Leslie Stevens,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:10%
Sr. was the Vice
Admiral in the US Navy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:10%
and was working with
Rear Admiral Rico

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Botta, who was part of
the people in the Navy

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:10%
that brought the German--

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:10%
scientists over in
Operation Paperclip

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:10%
and started the
Secret Space Program.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So it was very likely that
they had many conversations.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And Gene Roddenberry may
have actually gotten the idea

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
from Leslie Stevens, Jr., who
got it from his father, Leslie

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Stevens.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And possibly
Roddenberry was trying

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to evoke what their
view of the future

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.084 align:middle line:84%
was going to be in this
Secret Space Program.

00:02:04.084 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think you're
right about that,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
because in my
research, I've come

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
across a lot of evidence that
is even public on the RAND

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Corporation's website.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And of course, RAND
comes out of the Cold War

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and is intimately
connected to NASA,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because both RAND and NASA
are under the aegis of the Air

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So they were very interested
in aerospace and controlling

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:90%
aerospace.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.071 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the real
root of the Secret Space Program

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
where all this black budget

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
money goes.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fact, actually, that
the RAND Corporation directly

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
consulted on the early episodes
of "Star Trek" with Gene

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Roddenberry.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:10%
So when you see
things like phasers

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.594 align:middle line:10%
or when you see things like
handheld communicating devices,

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:10%
sliding doors, that's
actually mentioned

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:10%
in the RAND Corporation
document, automation

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:10%
of everything--

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:10%
this was planned.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.029 align:middle line:84%
And I think we were
being, in a way, kind

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.195 align:middle line:90%
of predictively programmed--

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Captain, you're making
a most unusual request.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.131 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm aware of that, Sir, but
it's of the utmost importance.

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:10%
You must give me permission
to divert to Vulcan.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>> But you refuse to explain
why it is so important.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --to accept these
coming gadgets, and so forth.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we could probably

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
postulate, that beyond that,
there's also, like you said,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:90%
a Secret Space Program.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And as "Star
Trek", the original series

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
was being developed,
across the Atlantic,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Stanley Kubrick is
making "2001," again

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
with all the help from
aerospace companies, saying,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Stanley, do this,
Stanley, show that.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that they're
both working together--

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
one in cinema, one
in television--

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to create this kind
of future world

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to
be probably immersed in

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
very soon, if the
technologies that we're being

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
told about really do exist.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think
they really do exist.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a funny
interview too, which

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
makes me think of your work,
where I saw Shatner talking

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.694 align:middle line:84%
about being given kind of a
tour of NASA back in the time

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
when they were doing the
original "Star Trek."

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
played a joke on him,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because they let him into
this experimental aircraft.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And outside of his
passenger window,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.965 align:middle line:10%
they flew an actual
Enterprise by the window.

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And he said it looked real.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And he said, I can't
believe people could have--

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
people could have been
fooled by the Moon, right?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.964 align:middle line:84%
So I think that echoes what
you were talking about.

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Shatner has your
work or something.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I don't know.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure NASA did have some
very advanced technologies,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from projecting things and
doing all sorts of work.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they
were working with Stanley

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
on high technology
cinema devices.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So they might have
been showing off.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.944 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Which I
think is a cover.

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Those things are a cover
for the real space program.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I agree.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's going on.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well,
another thing that I

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.436 align:middle line:84%
find interesting
about Roddenberry

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
himself is that there seems
to be two Roddenberrys.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There's the vocal,
atheist Roddenberry, who

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
is a hardcore
materialist, doesn't

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
believe in anything spiritual.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when I see all
of these episodes, even

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
in the old series and then
into "Next Generation,"

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
as well as the other
series and the movies,

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
gnostic influence.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of Platonism
and Neoplatonism.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I see ancient mythology,
esoteric teachings, alchemy.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:10%
All of these things
come into play.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if there
weren't two Roddenberrys.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Roddenberry was
conflicted over time

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and shifted his views.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
he was involved

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.554 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of groups
that were channeling

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and thought that they might
be contacting alien entities--

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:90%
The Nine, and so forth.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of weird
parallels and maybe a divided

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
mind, perhaps, in the
case of Roddenberry.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: This seems to be--

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of the whole group
that was around The Nine

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
seems to have this
conflicted view,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Arthur
Young or Andrija

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Puharich to Gene Roddenberry.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:90%
They all were atheists.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
But they all had
this idea that there

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is this consciousness, this
mysterious consciousness,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:90%
that could be tapped.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
channeling entities

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:90%
that they thought were alien.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a crazy story.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It goes into Jack Sarfatti,
the famous physicist who

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
claimed that he received phone
calls from an alien voice that

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.066 align:middle line:90%
gave him high physics concepts.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This is all happening
at the same time.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Late '50s, early '60s,
all of these things

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
are going on-- in Hollywood,
"Star Trek," Stanley Kubrick,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
the physicist, Gene Roddenberry.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
this like weird mix

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
of some outside
influence trying to shape

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the culture of the future
through the shows that

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:90%
were happening.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me like
the Secret Space Program

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is behind this kind of
predictive programming

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that they were
doing at the time.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, and what's interesting
is about the episode that we're

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.065 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking
about, "The Chase,"

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going to look
back to ancient history

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
in the episode that tells
us about our origins

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.844 align:middle line:84%
and gives us some
aspect of a DNA code.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
we're going to see

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
is that this DNA code
actually suggests

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of a single
source or a single maker.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way
DNA is structured,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
it's actually like
a computer program.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.652 align:middle line:84%
And so that, to me, suggests
a single designer or origin.

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's all included
in this episode, which,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
again, is very odd
given this supposed

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:90%
atheism of Roddenberry.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: "Star Trek,
Next Generation,"

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
"The Chase" is actually
them letting out

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
some of their most secret
information about our origins.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Panspermia, basically.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Panspermia is a very popular
theory amongst a lot of very

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:10%
well-known scientists--

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:10%
and Crick, and so forth.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's really, I think,
the basis of this episode.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But it also ties into
ancient mythology.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.212 align:middle line:84%
So the first clip that
we're in a look at is the--

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
in this clip, what's
happening is this archeologist

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
that Picard used to study
under is showing him

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
this object that is kind of a
foreshadowing for what happens

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of this episode.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So this object isn't directly
connected to the civilization

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to explore.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But again, it foreshadows,
because what Picard figures out

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the Kurlan
civilization behind this object

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
believe that an individual was
a community of individuals.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's an
organic relationship

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.164 align:middle line:84%
between all the lifeforms
in these communities.

00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's actually
going to be the message

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of this whole episode.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.289 align:middle line:84%
But it's foreshadowed at the
beginning in this object.

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at the
Kurlan civilization.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.205 align:middle line:10%
>> You mean it's complete?

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.934 align:middle line:90%


00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:24.378 align:middle line:10%
[EXHALES] Oh.

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:10%
[EXHALES] Well, the
Kurlan civilization

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:10%
believed that an individual
was a community of individuals.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:10%
Inside us are many voices,
each with its own desires,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:10%
its own style, its
own view of the world.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:10%
The Kurlan civilization died
out thousands of years ago.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:10%
It is extraordinarily rare
to find a figurine intact.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:10%
Professor, this is
an incredible find.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:10%
>> It's yours, Jean-Luc.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, no.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:10%
How can I accept this?

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Graciously, Mr. Picard.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:10%
You could accept it graciously.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.764 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's a lot
going on in this episode.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
that we note is

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that this father figure
archetype that is

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:90%
talking to Picard that he--

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Picard used to study under
him, his name is Galen.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And Galen was the
famous Greek physician

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and philosopher and astrologer.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.274 align:middle line:84%
So that's mentioned
for a reason.

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
we're immediately

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:10%
talking about archetypes.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:10%
So the archetype that
Picard is dealing with

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:10%
is this father
figure that he feels

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:10%
like he's let down, because
Picard chose the Star captain

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.877 align:middle line:10%
route in life and path.

00:09:59.877 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't choose
to be an archaeologist.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's this tension
between that archetype.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
that's also going

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to foreshadow the
tension between the races

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.122 align:middle line:84%
and their maker,
creator, archetype.

00:10:12.122 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going to
see throughout this episode.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's just so many
levels of what's going on here.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> We're going.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:10%
The Enterprise isn't something
that I can leave and then come

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:10%
back to.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:10%
If I go, I go for good.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's not something
that I'm prepared to do.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.399 align:middle line:10%
>> This is not some
undergraduate study project

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:10%
that you're turning down.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:10%
This is a chance of a lifetime.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.585 align:middle line:10%
Don't make the
same mistake twice.

00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't believe that my
career in Starfleet has been

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.975 align:middle line:10%
a mistake.

00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:10%
>> What are you doing
at this very moment?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:10%
A study mission.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:10%
You're like some Roman centurion
out patrolling the provinces,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:10%
maintaining a dull
and bloated empire.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.620 align:middle line:10%
>> We both know that's not true.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I know this, I know
that as a scholar,

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:10%
you're nothing but a dilettante.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:10%
Years ago, I gave
you the opportunity

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:10%
to become the
foremost archeologist

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.732 align:middle line:10%
of your generation.

00:11:14.732 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:10%
Your achievements could have
outstripped even my own.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:10%
But no, you decided to reject
a life of profound discovery.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.085 align:middle line:10%
And you walked out on me.

00:11:25.085 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think it's
interesting your remark earlier

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
about panspermia,
because I think

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that when Crick and
Watson discovered DNA,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Crick was really in a conundrum.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And he could not understand
how something as complex as DNA

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
could possibly have
formed in the short time

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that life was on Earth, the
4 billion years or whatever,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:90%
2 billion years actually.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he was really
vexed by that.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's when he--

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he came up
with the panspermia theory,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
but he adapted it and said, no,
this is actually what must be,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that somehow there is
DNA moving through space

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and is falling
down onto planets.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And if that planet is
lucky enough to have water,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that DNA will now sprout
and turn into life.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:10%
And I think that that is really
what this episode is really

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:10%
trying to say.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:10%
It's trying to back
up Crick's ideas

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:10%
that DNA is so much
more complicated,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:10%
it couldn't possibly
have originated here.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.951 align:middle line:84%
What I find fascinating is
that, as we're going to see,

00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Picard and the
crew will actually

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
say that the DNA sequence
that they discover

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.589 align:middle line:90%
is like a computer code.

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
He says, it's almost like
an ancient civilization

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
had an advanced technology,
that they created humans

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
to be these kind of
programmed-- or well, the races,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
actually-- to be these
kind of programmed beings

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
like they were made
in a computer code.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking
about the DNA.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:10%
But originally, they don't
know what this object is

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:10%
and what this code is.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they figure
out, oh, this is actually DNA,

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe this could lead
us back to our origins.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.869 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's going to be--

00:12:57.869 --> 00:13:00.034 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to
answer that question that's

00:13:00.034 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
raised by that initial object
of "the one and the many," how

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
do we balance the relationship
between many individuals

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and one whole group, many
races, one whole group.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the focus
of this episode.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.455 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes back to
the spiritual origins.

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's right, because
there's really again two kinds

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:90%
of one--

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
there's the unity of
everybody together,

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and then there is
one as an individual.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:10%
And the entire
problem that we face

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:10%
is, how do we unite the two.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.464 align:middle line:84%
How do we take the individual
and make them part of the one

00:13:27.464 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
without ruining
their individual--

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --nature.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
this episode is about.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very brave
question to ask.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I like the answer
that they give.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.182 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: This is a perennial
problem in philosophy.

00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what I studied in
grad school, was philosophy.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice a lot of
philosophers even comment

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that the history of
Western philosophy,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as ancient
Eastern philosophy,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
is precisely this question
of the one versus the many.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So I like that this episode
raises that question,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
because you can go back to
the ancient Vedic texts.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
At the very beginning,
5000 BC to 1,500

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
BC, they're asking
that question of,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
how do we balance the
one versus the many?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Is there one whole absolute?

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
What about all the
particulars of our experience?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate
philosophical question.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And this episode is raising it.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And so let's go to the next
clip, which is, Captain, this

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
is not a natural sequence,
it's part of an algorithm.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:10%
>> This is not part of a
natural design, Captain.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:10%
This is part of an algorithm,
coded at the molecular level.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.625 align:middle line:10%
>> An algorithm?

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.304 align:middle line:10%
Are you saying that
these DNA fragments

00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:10%
are elements in some
kind of computer program?

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I know how it sounds.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:10%
But there's no way this
could be a random formation.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:10%
This is definitely
part of a program.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:10%
>> This fragment has been part
of every DNA strand on Earth

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:10%
since life began there.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:10%
And the other fragments
are just as old.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:10%
Someone must have written this
program over 4 billion years

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.096 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:14:45.096 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:10%
>> So 4 billion years ago,
someone scattered this genetic

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:10%
material into the primordial
soup of at least 19 different

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:10%
planets across the galaxy.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The genetic information
must have been incorporated

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:10%
into the earliest life forms on
these planets and then passed

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:10%
down through each generation.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:10%
>> But why would anyone do
this in the first place?

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.784 align:middle line:10%
>> And what was this
program designed to do?

00:15:05.784 --> 00:15:08.283 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we couldn't know that
until we assembled the entire

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:10%
program and ran it.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.814 align:middle line:10%
We've tried all of
the DNA material

00:15:10.814 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:10%
in the Federation
computer, but we

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:10%
haven't been able to come up
with any compatible protein

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:10%
configurations.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.864 align:middle line:10%
>> Then they must be from
worlds outside the Federation.

00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:19.655 align:middle line:10%
Mr. Data, how many
people on the Enterprise

00:15:19.655 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:10%
are from non-Federation planets?

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:22.455 align:middle line:10%
>> 17, Sir.

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, this
may be a long shot,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:10%
but we should check each one of
these 17 people to see if they

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:10%
have the correct
protein configuration.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.012 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll begin collecting
DNA samples now.

00:15:31.012 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, Captain,
I've been thinking,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:10%
somebody else must know
about this program.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:10%
I bet one of the missing
fragments was on Indri VIII.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.282 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it was destroyed.

00:15:40.282 --> 00:15:43.135 align:middle line:10%
>> To keep us from finding
that piece of the puzzle.

00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So DNA is the
information code for life.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't just encode
numerical sequences.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.485 align:middle line:90%
It also carries information.

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's so fascinating, is

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that modern science
actually backs up

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the idea of race memories
or genetic memories

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and that we are in a weird way
linked to all of our ancestors

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
back to the beginning--
whatever that was.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's also hinted
at that, not just

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
our physical biological
being, but also

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.014 align:middle line:84%
reality itself has this
kind of numerical sequence

00:16:11.014 --> 00:16:11.813 align:middle line:90%
or structure.

00:16:11.813 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I almost get the
impression that--

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.786 align:middle line:84%
and there's other episodes of
"Star Trek, Next Generation"

00:16:15.786 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
that hints at this--

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of a kind of platonic
view of reality,

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that reality is made up of
formal geometric structures

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and that the reality
that we experience

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
on the third dimension plane
is not the only reality.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
There's also other
levels of reality.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Socrates mentions
this in the "Phaedo."

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.901 align:middle line:84%
He says there's other
dimensions, actually,

00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the dialogue.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's just fascinating
to me that this is actually

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
incorporating Pythagoreanism,
as well as DNA, and coding,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, as the
basis of this episode.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.325 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
philosophical, very spiritual.

00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And it gets back to that
whole thing of our origins

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and who we are and why
this is so important.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Insiders tell me that many of
the alien races that they've

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
encountered are humanoid and
that this humanoid example is

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
spread throughout the
whole entire galaxy

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:90%
and that they are humanoid.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
And Carl Sagan
would argue, no, no,

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:10%
if it was a different form
on a different planet,

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:10%
it would evolve
completely differently,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:10%
as he did in several
of his books.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, if
panspermia is the vehicle

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
behind the spreading of
life, then he's wrong.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
It would be a humanoid
type of creature being

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
spread throughout the galaxy.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very interesting

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that the aliens, the builder
race that spread the DNA

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.060 align:middle line:90%
everywhere, chose 19 worlds.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:90%
19 is a huge number in Islam.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.455 align:middle line:10%
It's a sacred number within the
flower of life, which is made

00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:10%
out-- it has 19 aspects to it.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very interesting
that they chose the number 19.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And people who know
sacred geometry

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
will know why that
is so important.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
writers behind this

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
seem to be wanting to tell us
something very, very important.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think that--

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the reasons I
wanted to do this episode,

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
idea of the builder

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
race, this original race that
lived in the galaxy, that

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
originated all life, that is
really important, because that

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
really removes a
lot of the barriers

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have between
races and between people.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Religions and ideas were all
coming from one unified source.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.074 align:middle line:84%
And that is the big secret
that needs to be given out

00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:90%
by the Secret Space Program.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
If that's what they
found, then they really

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.275 align:middle line:90%
need to tell us this.

00:18:35.275 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in the
next clip, we're

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
going to look at the meeting
with the higher entity,

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.614 align:middle line:84%
the transcendent being that
we think in this episode is

00:18:43.614 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:90%
the origin of all the races.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
"it was our wish."

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Life evolved in my planet
before all others us in this

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
part of the galaxy.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:10%
We left our world,
explored the stars,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.116 align:middle line:10%
and found none like ourselves.

00:19:01.116 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Our civilizations
thrived for ages.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:10%
But what is the life of one race
compared to the vast stretches

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:10%
of cosmic time?

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:10%
We knew that one day we would
be gone, that nothing of us

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:10%
would survive.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:10%
So we left you.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists seeded
the primordial oceans

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of many worlds, where
life was in its infancy.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:10%
The seed codes
directed your evolution

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:10%
toward a physical
form resembling ours--

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:10%
this body you see
before you, which

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:10%
is, of course, shaped as yours
as shaped, for you are the end

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:10%
result. The seed codes also
contained this message,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:10%
which were scattered
in fragments

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:10%
on many different worlds.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:10%
It was our hope
that you would have

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:10%
to come together in
fellowship and companionship

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:10%
to hear this message.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you can see and hear me,
our hope has been fulfilled.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:10%
You are a monument,
not too our greatness,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:10%
but to our existence.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:22.535 align:middle line:10%
That was our wish, that
you, too, would know life

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:10%
and would keep alive our memory.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.518 align:middle line:10%


00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:10%
There is something
of us in each of you,

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.546 align:middle line:10%
and so something of
you in each other.

00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:10%
Remember us.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.266 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:45.384 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So as the races
discover their origins,

00:20:45.384 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
right before this
scene, there's a bunch

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.882 align:middle line:84%
of petty squabbling over the
discovery of a bioweapon.

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of the races think
that they can actually,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
because of this sequence
that they've discovered,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and re-engineer it, reverse
engineer it into a bioweapon.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's amazing, because
at the time this was produced,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know about the PNAC
document, which actually talks

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:90%
about race-specific bioweapons.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would venture to guess
that the military has had

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.664 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge for a long time.

00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But what is the warning
of this episode?

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.779 align:middle line:84%
It's precisely
that, that how are

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we going to use the
knowledge that we have?

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to use it in a
strictly social Darwinian sense

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of trying to stamp
out everyone else that

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hold our views?

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be
tyrannical and Nietzschean

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and Ubermenschen and try
to squash all resistance?

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to
learn, which I appreciate

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that Picard and the
crew in this episode

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
are actually interested in
discovering the questions,

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:90%
the riddles.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.961 align:middle line:90%
They want to solve the riddles.

00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They're not interested
in creating bioweapons.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's the danger,
is which of these

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.718 align:middle line:90%
are we going to choose?

00:21:46.718 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the key to
this episode and the key message

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
take away is that,

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
until we get past
these distinctions

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and learn that there
is a common source,

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
a common spiritual transcendent
unity from which we

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
do originate, from
which we come,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
then we're always
going to be caught up

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:90%
in these petty divisions.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.981 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
means that we have

00:22:06.981 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to lose our individuality
or our distinctions.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But rather as philosophy
has always tried to say

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.703 align:middle line:84%
and as ancient religions
have always tried to say,

00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
there has to be some
kind of perpetual balance

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:90%
between the one and the many.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
caught in what's

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
called dialectical tensions.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can never get
out of that cycle.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It definitely
is the human dilemma.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to mention
is that, if you actually

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
examine DNA, you'll find out
that all living things on Earth

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
are really closely
related to each other.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there's hardly any
difference between plants

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
and animals and humans.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And we all share--

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it also
brings up what is junk DNA?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it really junk DNA?

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Or is it part of
some larger program

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.642 align:middle line:84%
that this race put into us that
we just haven't decipher yet?

00:22:51.642 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, actually,
that's actually--

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that's been discarded now.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.037 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, it's
no longer junk DNA.

00:22:58.037 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And even Richard Dawkins has
changed his mind and said--

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Good.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --oh, it's actually
not junk DNA anymore.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong about that.

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:05.636 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So what
did they think it is?

00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:07.915 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, they
think that the coding

00:23:07.915 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of functions that
we just don't know yet.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.498 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's
what it is, yeah.

00:23:11.498 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a sub-code
of some kind.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what we know now
that DNA is active in water.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know that is
the basis of all life.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Crick and
Watson, who discovered it,

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Watson believed in
panspermia, because he

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
understood the complexities
of this whole thing.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we probably did
not originate here on Earth.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
If a scholar like Crick thinks
that we did not originate here,

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.686 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to take
that into consideration.

00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "Star Trek" is
amazing on many levels,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
principally because it really
is the origin of modern science

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
fiction.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
man going into space,

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, really has
its seeds in "Star Trek."

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, you could
find pulp science fiction

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and you could find HG Wells
stories and stuff like that.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:10%
But for the mass
mind in terms of TV,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:10%
which is far more powerful
than any kind of book,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:10%
as many of the
propagandists have said,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:10%
I think that what implanted in
everyone's mind, the wonders

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:10%
and adventures of space travel,
which would then kind of build

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:10%
up the prowess of NASA is
precise the science fiction

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:10%
in "Star Trek." and I think
that the fact that Roddenberry

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:10%
is consulting with people from
the RAND Corporation, people

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:10%
from the Deep State,
just like Kubrick,

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a lot
more going on here.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're being told a lot more
through these kinds of shows

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
than we are, as you
said, mainstream media.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:90%
And what is it ultimately?

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.435 align:middle line:84%
Well, the message
is philosophical.

00:24:41.435 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It's spiritual.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:90%
It's religious.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It's that there is
a single origin.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And we can look to
things like code and DNA

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
at the geometrical
structure of reality

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that Plato and Socrates
were talking about 2,000,

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years ago.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
That is the key to this
and to all existence.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: "Star Trek"
was the first time

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that Hollywood was throwing big
money behind a science fiction

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
You could argue that "Outer
Limits" was a science fiction

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very low
budget science fiction show.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And Hollywood had
not really decided

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to throw money behind a
mature science fiction show.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember that
science fiction was pretty

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:90%
immature up until "Star Trek."

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And "Star Trek" took its
science fiction seriously,

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:84%
just like Kubrick took his
science fiction seriously.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that these are
going on at the same time,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I think, is indicative
of what they're

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell us and
what kind of future

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to have.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, this whole thing
is built around the human race

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
being unified to go and
become what we should be,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:90%
which is explorers of the stars.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
our destiny as a race.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%

time on "Hollywood Decoded."
