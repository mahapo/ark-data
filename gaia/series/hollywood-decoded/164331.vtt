00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY DYER: Is there a
hidden, more esoteric,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.490 align:middle line:84%
deeper meaning to
the Hollywood films

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:90%
that we all love to watch?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.498 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner,

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.274 align:middle line:90%
and this is "Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:19.613 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:24.383 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "Twin Peaks" is
America in microcosm.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
It's David Lynch's attempt
at combining satire and soap

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
opera to picture both the
dark and the light side

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.345 align:middle line:90%
of the American experience.

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
this is a real drill

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
down into the early
1990s America,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
where everything was hidden.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
No one was talking about it.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.629 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it was shocking
to America at the time.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, you would
never see something

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
like this on mainstream
TV again nowadays.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that Lynch has combined things

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't think
could be combined.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
He's taken, again, noir,
neo-noir influence.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
He's combining that
with the satire

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of the American experience.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's also throwing
in soap opera.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that the draw of this show

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
mocking soap operas.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, it is.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.833 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But he's saying America
is kind of a soap opera,

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but he's also going to
reveal a lot of truth

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
about how things really
work in the real world.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And the whole film is really
talking about duality.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called "Twin Peaks."

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's about
everything has its opposite.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a doppelganger.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in a
mirror to each other,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and even all the way to the
very last shot of the series,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
where the villain
is in the mirror,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and DB Cooper's been taken
over by that villain.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.155 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The whole
thing is about this kind

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%
of mirrored world.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there is an America

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
which is being presented at the
time of all goodness and light,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.727 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
the America as being

00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:00.185 align:middle line:84%
presented in "Twin Peaks,"
which is probably more truthful.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:90%
And Lynch loves to do that.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
He loves to combine the serene
American pie with something

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
almost Southern
Gothic, something

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
like you'd see in
Flannery O'Connor, where

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
in "Blue Velvet,"
you're watering the lawn

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
and you find an ear, you know?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Or "Wild at Heart,"
it's this radical tale

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of American revolution,
where Nicolas Cage and Laura

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Dern are on the run from
traditional morality

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.591 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But what we want to look at
here in this first clip is going

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
to set the tone,
I think, for what

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with on
many levels, many planes.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we've said, Lynch
loves to discuss shamanism.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
He loves to discuss the idea
of there being other worlds.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
He says this in
many interviews, he

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
believes that there's
other planes of existence.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
This is all going to be
woven into the script, woven

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
into the story of "Twin Peaks,"
where we have this Black

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Lodge and this White Lodge.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So next we're going to look at
the problem that Cooper has.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And he's trying to
solve this murder

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:10%
of Laura Palmer in this bizarre
backwoods town of Twin Peaks.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:10%
And he's having
these dreams, right?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
He uses this Buddhist
technique of free association,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and what we might call
twilight language to try to--

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
through synchronicity-- piece
together who the killer is.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.784 align:middle line:84%
And he's been whispered in
a dream who the killer is,

00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
but he can't remember.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.755 align:middle line:90%
So let's watch that.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Following a dream
I had three years ago,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:10%
I have become deeply moved
by the plight of the Tibetan

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:10%
people, and filled with
a desire to help them.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:10%
I also awoke from the
same dream realizing

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:10%
that I had subconsciously
gained knowledge

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:10%
of a deductive
technique involving

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:10%
mind-body coordination operating
hand in hand with the deepest

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:10%
level of intuition.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:10%
Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if
you will please assist me,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.932 align:middle line:10%
I will now demonstrate.

00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So Cooper knows through
his Tibetan Buddhist philosophy

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is a plane
that you can access.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of recalls maybe,
Sherlock Holmes and opium.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:10%
Not through drugs,
but through an altered

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.001 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness,
that maybe he

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:10%
can solve crimes through
the psycho-sphere, right?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:10%
And so he gets this
idea that through the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:10%
dreams that he's
having maybe he's

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:10%
actually speaking to the spirit
of the deceased Laura Palmer.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
She appears to be maybe trapped
in this Black Lodge, which

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of prison house in
the next level of existence

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.265 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
realm or so forth.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, he's definitely
using a lot of Tibetan Buddhist

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:90%
themes, the way he meditates.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
He openly tells people
that he's pursuing

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
this kind of spiritual
path, and he's not really

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
afraid to tell people this.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually one of the
most interesting characters

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
in television history, because
he's actually a pretty nice guy

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
until the very end.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're kind of rooting
for him to solve the crime,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
but he never does.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, and
what Cooper is onto

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility of the
occult in this murder.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else can even
conceive of that,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:90%
they don't think it's possible.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And he knows that if he taps
into that spiritual realm

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that he might be able to get a
clue as to who the killer was.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's weird is that
throughout the series,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll have this
otherworldly presence that

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:90%
keeps stepping in.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see giants.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see owls taking
on a spiritual significance.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
midgets stepping into--

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER:
Backward-talking midgets.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Reverse-talking
midgets, right.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's all going to
have a specific meaning.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But I mentioned that technique
of solving crimes in a way

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that most people wouldn't,
which is a free association

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
kind of twilight technique.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'll explain that when
we look at this clip.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.159 align:middle line:10%
>> I was old, sitting
in a red room.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:10%
There was a midget in a red
suit and a beautiful woman.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.366 align:middle line:10%
The little man told me that my
favorite gum was coming back

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:10%
into style, and
didn't his cousin

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:10%
look exactly like Laura Palmer?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.425 align:middle line:10%
Which she did.

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>> What cousin?

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The beautiful woman.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:10%
She is filled with secrets.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes her arms bend back.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:10%
Where she's from, the
birds sing a pretty song,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:10%
and there's always
music in the air.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:10%
The midget did a
dance, Laura kissed me,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and she whispered the name
of the killer in my ear.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.015 align:middle line:10%
>> Who was it?

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:11.375 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't remember.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So this is Cooper's
divination technique,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
the synchro-mystic
connection to where

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:84%
he's going to speak a name
to this rock, throw the rock,

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and see how close it gets
to breaking the bottles.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And by that, he's going to
divine who might or might not

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:90%
have killed Laura Palmer.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Now this seems absurd, and
with Lynch's fascination

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
with surrealism, there is
an acceptance of the absurd.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The show is partly
comedy, it's dark satire.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Very.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.243 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But there's also a sense
in which I think Lynch really

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
does believe that these
synchro-mystic techniques might

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:90%
be real.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
There might be a
way to decode what's

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
called twilight
language, that there's

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
a kind of script that's being
written, maybe by archons,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
or angelic forces that are
higher than us, that requires

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
interpreting not just
this or that event,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
but entire events as a
whole, which might involve

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
the names involved in something,
or the sacred geometry involved

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
in a site, or where it
is on a parallel, right?

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
So all of these combine.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
What you wrote, for
example, in "King-Kill/33"

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:90%
with James Shelby Downard--

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you have this multiple layers
of decoding an event, right?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Now we mentioned Dave McGowan.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
He talked about this as
well with Maury Terry's work

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
on the zodiac.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe there is
a twilight language

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.137 align:middle line:84%
that we can read by which
we decode ritual events.

00:07:36.137 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's going
on in "Twin Peaks."

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a big ritual event.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and definitely,
Cooper is tapping into that.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that David
Lynch probably

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
had this idea that he was
going to make a detective who

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
used these powers
that he definitely

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:90%
has explored in his own life.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot
to be said for it.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you throw the I
Ching, and what you're doing

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is you're divining that
moment in which you're

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:90%
throwing the I Ching.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about the past
or the future, necessarily.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the past and the future
as reflected in that moment,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's what he's
doing with these rocks.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to find his
way through this morass,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and he's using these magical
means to guide his way.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he will be
the more successful person

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:90%
guiding his way through this.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the faces of the
people he's explaining it to.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
him at all.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
They can't conceive of
it being an occult crime,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
and operating on
multiple levels.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Cooper
ultimately does solve the case,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
but he ends up going
down the dark side.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.811 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in the next scene,
we're going to look at the path

00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to the Black Lodge.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And this really sums
up where we're going.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
The series takes a dark turn.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Because although he
solves the initial murder

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
towards the end of season one
and into two of Laura Palmer,

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
more murders start
happening, and we find out

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that it's his nemesis, sort
of this Moriarty character,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
his nemesis, Windom
Earle, who's a former FBI

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:84%
guy who got into the left-hand
path, as we see here.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:10%
>> I found this in
the project archives.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.406 align:middle line:10%
>> These evil sorcerers--

00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:10%
Dugpas, they're
called-- they cultivate

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:10%
evil for the sake of
evil, nothing else.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:10%
They express themselves
in darkness for darkness

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:10%
without leavening motive.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:10%
Now this ardent purity allows
them to access a secret place

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:10%
where the cultivation
of evil proceeds

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.105 align:middle line:10%
in exponential fashion, and with
it, the furtherance of evil's

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:10%
resulting power.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.375 align:middle line:10%
This place of power is
tangible, and as such,

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:10%
it can be found, entered,
and perhaps utilized

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:10%
in some fashion.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:10%
The Dugpas have many names
for them, but chief among them

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:10%
is the Black Lodge.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:10%
You don't believe me, don't you?

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:10%
You think I'm mad, over-worked.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:10%
Go away.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Gentlemen, when Windom
Earle arrived in Twin Peaks,

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:10%
I assumed he had come
for vengeance, for me.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:10%
But I miscalculated.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:10%
He has insinuated himself into
the lives of people I care for.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:10%
He has murdered innocents.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:10%
He has engaged us in subterfuge
and red herring, a fish

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't particularly care for.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:10%
But all of these acts
are merely camouflage.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.626 align:middle line:10%
He's been after something else
all along, the Black Lodge.

00:10:47.626 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: David Lynch is really
interested in VHS tapes

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.570 align:middle line:90%
laying around, right?

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
Project Blue Book

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
archives that the
major discusses.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And in this archive, he
found that Windom Earle,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
the former FBI nemesis
to Agent Cooper--

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.649 align:middle line:84%
he was actually involved
in Project Blue Book.

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered was that
there were these other planes

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
of existence, and that
this ancient tribe

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of shamans, the Dugpas, actually
turned to the dark side.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to basically
enact evil for evil's sake,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
just total chaos, no
rhyme or reason for it.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And Windom Earle falls
in love with this idea,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:90%
and basically goes mad.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:10%
And so we realize that
even though it's madness,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:10%
there's a method to it, in
that he's doing these ritual

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:10%
murders for a reason.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
He's leaving these
clues for Cooper,

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
typical serial
killer-type stuff.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But what I think
is most fascinating

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
is that it's specifically
mentioned in connection

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to the UFO phenomenon,
Project Blue Book.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And that in the book
that Mark Frost wrote--

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:10%
the co-creator
with David Lynch--

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:10%
it is specifically about JPL
laboratories, L. Ron Hubbard,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:10%
and that Crowleyan-type
approach to decoding the spirit

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:10%
behind "Twin Peaks,"
which is this Black Lodge.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, that's
really interesting,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
what he's doing here, and how
it precursors "The X-Files."

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: But it's
very interesting

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that he's going
in this direction.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been quite
jarring to the people watching

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
the show at the time,
because it's so completely

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
different from the first half
of the season, where he's now

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
going off on all
these other things,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and he's connecting UFOs
with cover ups, and rituals,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and murder, and agents gone bad.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it also should
be said that one

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
of the things that Crowley
was really trying to do

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
was to create the apocalypse.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.455 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:12:44.455 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He was
influenced greatly

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
by John Dee, Queen
Elizabeth's court astrologer,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
who also had this great love
of this idea of the apocalypse.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.826 align:middle line:84%
And some people think that
the entire British going out

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
into the world and
conquering the world

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
was part of this
John Dee apocalypse,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.222 align:middle line:84%
and both Crowley and John Dee
were secret agents, and were--

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: British intelligence.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.763 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: British intelligence.

00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
think that they

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
were using occult
language as a cover

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
up for trying to tell the queen
or the royalty what was really

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It looked
like occult gibberish,

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.290 align:middle line:84%
but it actually, it was hey,
they're invading Poland,

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and this is going on,
and this is happening.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: John Dee was
also the first 007.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.995 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And so
I think that Lynch

00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
is exploring that
whole idea, that there

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is an powerful occult
group in our military

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and in government that
actually wants the apocalypse.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: In the next
clip we're going

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:10%
to look at, on the
wings of love, which

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.074 align:middle line:10%
shows Windom Earle basically
solving the dark side of what

00:13:52.074 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:10%
the Black Lodge is,
and basically trying

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:10%
to open up this portal or gate.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:10%
So here what we've
seen is Windom Earle,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:10%
the serial killer,
on his hell-bent path

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:10%
to find the portal
to the Black Lodge.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And he realizes that it has to
do with Native American cave

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:10%
paintings.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:10%
And what's fascinating is that
the Native American religious

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.287 align:middle line:10%
mythology has a place
for these giants.

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:10%
>> (WHISPERING) Yes!

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.675 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And these giants
come up in the show.

00:14:18.675 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a
very funny scene.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:10%
But the giant is in
part leading Cooper

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:10%
down his path to solve
where the White Lodge is.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And what
happens with Earle

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:10%
is that he realizes that
the White Lodge needs

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:10%
to be inverted to open up the
gateway to the Black Lodge.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:10%
So all the black magic,
all the occult stuff

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:10%
is based on that
principle of inversion.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:10%
So he turns this
little knob, right?

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:10%
And he flips the little
diamond upside down.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And once again, we see
diamonds, just like in "2001."

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Why is it a diamond?

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
In "Twin Peaks,"
these are planes.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They're squares that
represent planes of existence.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And Lynch explains
this, actually.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So on our plane
of existence, it's

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:84%
in between the middle
world, between the White

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Lodge and the Black Lodge.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.596 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Right,
we're in Middle-Earth.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Exactly, and
so Earle is opening

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
the left-hand path, which
he actually mentions,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.455 align:middle line:90%
to the Black Lodge.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And if you
look at the symbol that

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is on the thing
he's turning, it's

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
two peaks with a square
right in the middle,

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
again referring back to
the title, and the fact

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that there's other
planes of existence.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And then he inverts that.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.525 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: He inverts it, right.

00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:30.336 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So he
inverts Twin Peaks.

00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So we're going to go
into the negative world, right?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
The upside down
world, so to speak.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.015 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: The
upside down world.

00:15:36.015 --> 00:15:38.344 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And in the
next clip, we're

00:15:38.344 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
going to see the path
to the Black Lodge

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is directly connected
to ritual magic

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
once again, the Goetia, and
sigils, and Solomonic magic,

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.076 align:middle line:84%
and opening these pathways to
other spirits and so forth.

00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
path to the Black Lodge.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:16:01.431 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.326 align:middle line:10%
>> What is it, Coop?

00:16:04.326 --> 00:16:08.258 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, just thinking
about Annie Blackburn.

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, bless your heart,
I've never known your mind

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:10%
to wander.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Ah, Harry, I've been
feeling this way all day.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And I proceed as usual my
mind clear and focused,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:10%
and then suddenly out of
nowhere, I see her face

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:10%
and I hear her voice.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:10%
Naturally, I try to
reorient myself, come back

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:10%
to the task at hand,
but the image remains.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.259 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I actually feel dizzy.

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now what was
important in the scene

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
was the symbol that was on
the board right behind Cooper.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And this is an
actual ritual magic sigil.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is that
this clues us into the fact

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.235 align:middle line:84%
that Windom Earle is
actually practicing Goetia.

00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:84%
He's actually practicing
the invocation

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:90%
of these dark spirits.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
is because he's actually

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
possessed by Bob.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: By Bob.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Bob is
this demonic power

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:10%
that's underneath, the
Man From Another Place,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:10%
basically, what's identified
as an alien being.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So basically, Bob is
this spiritual slave,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:84%
the servant who's actually doing
the killings, from Laura Palmer

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:90%
all the way into season two.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And he's underneath,
he's a servant

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to the Man from Another Place,
the little midget guy, who

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
is basically a demon, but
also an alien for all intents

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and purposes in this series.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So what Earle is doing is
actually the motivation of Bob,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
this spirit, who as
we're going to see,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is actually going to offer up
the sacrifice of these people

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to the Man From Another Place.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Bob is a
very interesting character,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
very mysterious in this film.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe he's only in about 130
seconds of the entire series,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.224 align:middle line:90%
yet he's the evil force in it.

00:17:51.224 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that his name

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is Bob, which is
spelled forwards

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:90%
and backwards the same.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: A palindrome, right.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.738 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah,
it's a palindrome.

00:17:56.738 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, one more
of David Lynch's

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
satiric tricks that he's
using to kind of show America

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%
as it is.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So Bob is the kind
of the everyman

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
name, Billy Bob in the south.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Right a
common guy, right.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Common guy who's
been turned into a demon.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
will consume even

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.335 align:middle line:84%
Agent Cooper, which is
a very interesting idea.

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, Cooper
throughout the series

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:90%
is on the white side.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's always,
in a way, tempted,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and it comes up several
times in the series--

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:90%
beware of the dark path.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Beware of going down
that route, it's egoism,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:90%
it's selfish, right?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And he finally
capitulates to that,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
which is so surprising,
because he's

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:90%
almost morally perfect, right?

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:84%
He needs an Achilles
heel, almost.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But rather than him having
some small fault or defect,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Lynch actually has to
be completely possessed

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the series.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You watch,
Cooper will be caught

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:90%
in like a 25-year [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You watch, it'll be
something so crazy, right?

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:90%
And he won't remember any of it.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.545 align:middle line:84%
Something like that's
going to happen.

00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:06.128 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, I think what we're
going to see in the next clip

00:19:06.128 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
is illustrative of
this point of how

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
things that are happening
in the Black Lodge

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
are intentionally outside
of time and space,

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and they're done in reverse.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And Lynch has said in
interviews that he intentionally

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
made the crew walk
around backwards on set

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and memorize their
lines in reverse.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we're in the
dark realm, and everything is--

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER:
Everything's reversed.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: --inverted.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that's kind of that
principle behind the dark side

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:90%
of the occult.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
I think that's why

00:19:32.665 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:90%
he made Cooper so pure.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.555 align:middle line:84%
Because he had to
show the reverse,

00:19:36.555 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and the reverse was
going to be so shocking--

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Extreme, yeah.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --that everyone
would fall in love with the idea

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.161 align:middle line:84%
that this reversal is
inevitable in our existence.

00:19:45.161 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Now we've talked a lot
about predictive programming.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And what's so amazing in this
next sequence, that I think

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
has mystified a lot of
people, is how, 25 years ago,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
would the conclusion
of the show have

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
known that the show would
be back in 25 years?

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Laura Palmer
whispers to Cooper in the Black

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Lodge.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: See you in 25 years.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.126 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:20:08.126 --> 00:20:11.507 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:11.507 --> 00:20:18.752 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll see you
again in 25 years.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile--

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:10%


00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So what we just saw
was Cooper finally figuring out

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:10%
what's going on.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Laura's spirit has been
trapped in this Black Lodge.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And she's prisoner to this
demon, this little midget

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Man from Another Place, right?

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The bad part of all
this, the worst aspect,

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
is that Laura is
molested by her father.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that happened
was that her father Leland

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:90%
was possessed by Bob.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So when Leland
dies, Bob's spirit

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
that's possessing him then
moves on to Windom Earle,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.505 align:middle line:84%
and then causes Windom Earle
to commit all these murders.

00:21:09.505 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: By the end of
the series, what happens

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
is Cooper ends up trapped
in that same Black Lodge

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:90%
with Laura Palmer.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And so because this is happening
outside of time and space,

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Laura Palmer's telling Cooper,
I'll see you again in 25 years.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And it almost makes us wonder
if David Lynch didn't know then

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that the show would come
back 25 years later.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It does
make you think that.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that what's so
frustrating about the final

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of "Twin Peaks" is
that you've fallen

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
in love with these
characters and everything,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
slams down on you,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're left
bereft, essentially.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.422 align:middle line:84%
Like, what the
hell just happened?

00:21:48.422 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: No happy ending here.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: No happy ending.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.484 align:middle line:84%
And you're left to
wonder why he did it.

00:21:53.484 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Now he knew the show was
going to be canceled.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So none of
that's an accident.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So him writing
this 25-year thing,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
he had to have known that he
was going to be doing this

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
in 25 years, that he
was going to pick it

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:90%
up again in 25 years.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Which really makes you
wonder who David Lynch is.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
How could you plan something
25 years ahead, especially

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
in showbiz?

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.003 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
see in the final clip

00:22:16.003 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
is something at once esoteric
and absurd and satirical.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's aspects of the
movie, "Fire Walk With Me,"

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
which is based on
the series, that

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
shows us more about
this Black Lodge

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't really
get in the series.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we've
come to understand

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is that Bob, that
spirit that's going out

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
at the behest of the
Man From Another Place--

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
he's tasked with
bringing back sacrifices

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.245 align:middle line:84%
for the Man From Another
Place, this midget guy, right?

00:22:46.245 --> 00:22:47.045 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And it's called
garmanbozia, right?

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I always think of like--

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:90%
it's called creamed corn--

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Creamed corn.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: --in the series.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this spirit, the
demon, eats creamed corn,

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
which is explained
to be the pain

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:90%
and suffering of his victims.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have this tradition
in a lot of religions

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where the idea of consuming
your victim and so forth

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
gives you their power.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And this demonic entity is
parasitical in that way.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
He feeds off of the
pain and suffering

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.687 align:middle line:84%
that Laura and the other
victims have exemplified.

00:23:19.687 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
see in this next clip

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:90%
demonstrates all that.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.378 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:25.378 --> 00:23:28.724 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.724 --> 00:23:41.445 align:middle line:10%
>> Bob, I want
all my garmonbozia

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So it's
all come to a close

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:10%
and we've discovered that
the town of Twin Peaks

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:10%
was not just happy America.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:10%
There was actually a
cult in the background.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:10%
This cult-- the
series explains--

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.104 align:middle line:10%
met above a convenience store.

00:23:57.104 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And Laura's dad was involved
in the cult, as well as

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.652 align:middle line:90%
other people in the town.

00:24:00.652 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:10%
They had a special
magical ring that they

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:10%
wore to signify their
membership in this cult.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
serving a demonic spirit,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:90%
whether they knew it or not.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.630 align:middle line:84%
This demonic spirit
was operating

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
on this other spiritual
plane, but events

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that happened in
our world caused

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
or create significances
or phenomena

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual plane.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the spiritual
plane can influence our plane.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And so to understand this
scene, which really, I think,

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:84%
kept a lot of people in
the dark for a long time,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:84%
all we have to understand
is that this demonic spirit

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:90%
wants to be fed.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And the way that he feeds
is by this pain and sorrow.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.794 align:middle line:84%
And so he uses
his henchman, Bob,

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that he's enslaved
underneath him,

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to be his killer, his
predator, to go out on the town

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and bring him offerings.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the humans in
this series are basically

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
puppets of these
spiritual forces,

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:90%
either for good or for evil.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's going on here.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It goes back to the
gnostic myth of the archons.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And if the archons need to
be fed our pain and sorrow

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
in order for them to
be full and happy,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and so they create
as much bedlam

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:84%
as they possibly can in our
society so that they have food.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, we-- our
emotions, our spiritual being--

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
is basically being sacrificed
to these dark entities, which

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the gnostics absolutely
said were real.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very close
analogy between the archons

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:90%
and psychopaths, for instance.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Now psychopaths also kind of eat
your pain and eat your sorrow.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They enjoy inflicting
pain and sorry.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.845 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's psychic vampirism.

00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And that's what
he's really talking about here,

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.855 align:middle line:90%
and a very, very deep thing.

00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of what we saw
in "Eyes Wide Shut," where

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
you have the reversing
of the liturgical music,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
the religious music,
the mass put in reverse.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here at the
end of the sequence in "Fire

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Walk With Me," where
Laura is shown imprisoned,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
is Luigi Cherubini's
"Requiem in C minor,"

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a liturgical
piece for mass, right?

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.561 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So Lynch is,
I think, intentionally

00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:11.004 align:middle line:84%
playing this to show that
this is the dark side,

00:26:11.004 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:90%
this is a black mass, right?

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And the real power
behind that mass

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.045 align:middle line:84%
is the sacrifice
of Laura Palmer.

00:26:17.045 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Right, and this is
a war between the two lodges.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, that's
what the gnostics said,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
we were involved
in a spiritual war

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth between
the forces of light

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and the forces of darkness.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And Lynch has pretty much
laid it out the way it is.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But what's funny is
that he didn't just lay it out

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:90%
as this occult story.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:84%
He laid it out as
something on the one

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.832 align:middle line:84%
hand, a satire of America,
it's also a goofy soap opera.

00:26:43.832 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
this, and it's just

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
like, you're laughing
half of the time

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing the most
absurd dark things, right?

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.141 align:middle line:84%
So it's dark satire,
and it's also noir,

00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's all of
these things in one.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, he's
doing a big dance there.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.895 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how long
he could have kept it up.

00:26:56.895 --> 00:26:58.854 align:middle line:84%
Even he probably wondered
at the end how long--

00:26:58.854 --> 00:27:00.394 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: How this on
for two seasons--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Exactly.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.730 align:middle line:84%
How it lasted two seasons is a
miracle in America in 1990's.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So you'll notice the
symbolism of the Black Lodge

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:84%
is interesting,
because you might

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
think that it would be a Masonic
black and white checkerboard

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.640 align:middle line:90%
floor.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's not, it's zigzag,
because it's peaks.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.467 align:middle line:84%
It's the good side and
the dark side, of the--

>>WEIDNER: The twin peaks.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --black peak,
the white peak, right?

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.646 align:middle line:84%
And you also see this
Saturn imagery there, right?

00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Next to Cooper, as
you're seeing there,

there's a very prominent
image of Saturn.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, recalls
that idea of Kronos

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:90%
who feeds on his children, time.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Time is actually--

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Time.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, so how
did Lynch know he'd still

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:10%
be alive 25 years from then?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:90%
He smokes cigarettes.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's amazing.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the Lodge is
sort of like hell too.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:84%
It's red, it's got the strange
quasi-Masonic floors, almost

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
like he's making fun
of the Masonic floor.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: In a way.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And a very
cheap set, by the way.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he wasn't spending
a whole lot of money

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
on these curtains.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, I
wonder a lot of times

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:84%
if he doesn't do those things
on purpose, it's intentional.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.125 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I think he does.

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Because we've seen so
many times in this series--

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a long-running
soap opera

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that everybody in
Twin Peaks watches

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:90%
that's a lot like "Twin Peaks."

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
meta-level here, where

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with layers.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that even his
portrayal of the Black Lodge

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:90%
is kind of satirical.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's almost kind
of a joke, right?

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.443 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I would say so.

00:28:27.443 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It does seem kind of
like a joke, yeah.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think the takeaway
is that David Lynch wants

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
us to see that there
are other worlds.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
He says this over and
over in interviews.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
He's very, very involved in
meditation in his own life.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:10%
And he says that
when he meditates,

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:10%
he goes into the astral realm,
or that deep subconscious

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:10%
realm from which he
receives the inspiration

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:10%
for his creative ambience that
nobody else can seem to mimic

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:10%
perfectly, I don't think.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.011 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's very unique.

00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere-- people
have this term Lynchian,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:90%
that nobody else can recreate.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I take away from
it is that that's reality,

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:90%
that reality is metaphysical.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the here and
the now, it's not just matter.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It's also other
planes of existence

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that are both
positive and negative.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And that's why
he presents it in kind

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:90%
of a matter of fact way.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And Cooper, who is
obviously David Lynch,

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
he does the same practices, same
kind of even manner about him.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
He even looks a
little bit like him.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:84%
He is the epitome of this kind
of caught between these two

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
worlds, these twin peaks
of duality, of metaphysics,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and physics, and how
we can use metaphysics

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to solve physical problems,
and use the physical world

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:90%
to solve metaphysical problems.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing is caught
in this war between the White

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Lodge and the Black Lodge, which
again, is very Masonic and very

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:90%
gnostic.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering where
he's getting a lot of this.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it from a dream state
that he's entering?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's what he says.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah?

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.253 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:29:59.253 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think Lynch is very
influenced by the literary

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
genre Southern Gothic, and
this would be Flannery O'Connor

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:90%
or William Faulkner.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And you always have,
in Southern Gothic,

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
the mix of traditional
religious ideas with something

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
just completely out of nowhere,
foreign, and often grotesque.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the idea of
something out of carnivale,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:27.002 align:middle line:84%
the midget, or the giant, or
somebody extremely overweight,

00:30:27.002 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a plot
device, essentially,

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:90%
in Southern Gothic literature.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is grotesque,
it is offensive.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But what the author or the
director is trying to convey

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
is that reality has these things
that we want to try to avoid.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.594 align:middle line:84%
That is a big part of
life, is the grotesque.

00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so Lynch, I think,
is doing the same thing

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:51.850 align:middle line:84%
with putting the
grotesque in our face

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.765 align:middle line:84%
to force us to look at the dark
side of these things, right?

00:30:56.765 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:90%
But not just the dark side.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be overly
negative, because there's

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
a redemptive aspect to all
this in that Lynch wants

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:90%
us to laugh at the dark side.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: He does.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: He wants
us to find humor.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's a
kind of catharsis.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle wrote
about the theater,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and why we want to watch
something that's grotesque,

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:84%
or a horror film, or
something like that,

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.015 align:middle line:84%
and it would be so that
we confront our fears.

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:24.815 align:middle line:90%
It's catharsis.

00:31:24.815 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's like watching
a car accident,

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.335 align:middle line:84%
you can't take your eyes
off a good horror film.

00:31:31.335 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You're caught in it,
and you're saying,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.750 align:middle line:84%
my god, I don't want to
watch this at all anymore,

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:90%
but I can't stop watching.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Lynch is like.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Lynch draws you in with that
music, and the sound effects.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he creates
a world where

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:84%
it's so dreamlike that you're
watching it-- in a way,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:90%
you're not remembering it.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Like you forget a dream too.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And the grotesqueries are a
necessary part of this thing,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
because what he's trying to
do is say this is reality.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:84%
You may look away,
you may not like it,

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
but this world is not just
lightness and sunshine.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: We also have
nightmares, right?

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.518 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: We also
have nightmares.

00:32:09.518 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:84%
There is also night
as opposed to day.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
There is criminals as
opposed to good people.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And the world is filled with
all of these things, demons

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and angels, and all
the contradictions that

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:90%
duality creates.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think that's
what Lynch is all about.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.
