hidden, more esoteric,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.490 align:middle line:84%
deeper meaning to
the Hollywood films

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.350 align:middle line:90%
that we all love to watch?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
When "2001-- A Space Odyssey"
first came out in 1968,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:10%
it bewildered the entire world.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
No one actually knew
what this film was about.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:10%
Rock Hudson is famous for
stomping out of the film

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:10%
during a Hollywood preview,
yelling, "What in the world

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:10%
am I watching?"

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this film is
one of the most important films

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
ever in cinema history, and
it bears a lot of scrutiny.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick used an
opportunity to make

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
what I consider to be the first
real true esoteric film ever

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
cinema, and which

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
details the path of
humanity from our origins,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
monkey-like origins, all the
way up to becoming a Star Child.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a Nietzschean journey and
probably the most important

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
journey that our
species can take.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And Kubrick has shown this
in a visual way, which

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:90%
is why the film is so great.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Very little dialogue,
a lot of great visuals.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So in this clip, the monkeys,
the apes, the ape men,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
from millions of years ago
first encounter the monolith,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
the black monolith, this
slab, inside their encampment.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to
see the reaction

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
to their first
encounter as we begin

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to realize that this
monolith is actually

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.799 align:middle line:84%
passing on viable information
to these man apes.

>>DYER: What I find
interesting about this is that,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:10%
if you read about the history
of what Arthur C. Clarke had

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:10%
in mind, it was
to be a TV screen.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.121 align:middle line:10%
It was actually going
to show moving images.

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:10%
And we almost get the
impression that this

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:10%
is something completely
new, out of this universe,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:10%
that's invading the reality
of these primitive creatures.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.682 align:middle line:90%
And it's a transitional phase.

00:02:17.682 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a period
in which there are

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
to be led into their
next stage of evolution.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder why they didn't
keep it as a television

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.564 align:middle line:90%
screen, a moving image.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
it's interesting.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Kubrick was going
to originally do that,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and I think he realized
that it was just too overt.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:10%
And so he chose the
symbol of the monolith,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:10%
which is a many,
many-headed esoteric symbol.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:10%
For one thing, it's black,
so it's the nigredo stone

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:10%
that you need to begin
the process of alchemy.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, if you look
at its dimensions,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
later scenes, we

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
can see that it's exactly the
same dimensions as the Cinerama

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
movie screen that it's
being projected on.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
This scene is so great
because Ligeti's music,

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
the Hungarian composer,
Ligeti's music

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is so numinous, that Kubrick
is knowingly turning this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
into almost a religious
experience for these man

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
apes who are fascinated
by the sharp edges

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:90%
and its pure simplicity.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that when we
see this scene, even though it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
probably never really
occurred this way,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
it does somehow drive its
way into our very being

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that we did have
an encounter at one

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
time with superior intelligences
who influenced us in a big time

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I know that in a
lot of religious traditions,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
you have the notion of this
completely foreign object,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe the ashlar of
Freemasonry, the cube.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
You have the idea of the
Kaaba stone in Mecca.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that there's
this otherworldly presence,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and we can't even describe it.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
the smoothness.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:90%
It has angles to it.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It's something completely
foreign to the rocky terrain

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%
that the apes are used to.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that they can't grasp.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond their capacity.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's here to trigger
them into the next stage,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's why
we see this alignment

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
of the celestial
bodies and this kind

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
of astrological significance
that's coming up.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, well, from
the beginning of the film,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
there's an alignment.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.788 align:middle line:84%
The very first shot is
the Earth, and the moon,

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:34.097 align:middle line:84%
and the sun in a
magical alignment.

00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So every time the
film begins, there's

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
this magical
alignment, which begins

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the magic of the film, which is
the transformation of humanity.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think that the monolith is
a superior object in that it's

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:10%
a cube of space.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, the whole
mystery of what we are

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
begins with understanding
the cube of reality,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
which is the three dimensions--
height, distance, and width.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what
Kubrick is giving is a geometry

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
lesson also here to the apes,
because we know that geometry

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is the first step
towards, again, this kind

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:90%
of self-realized mind.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
geometry in ancient Egypt

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
was the very precursor
of mathematics,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and also in Greece.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what he's seeing here.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to make
it a geometrical

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
object because that would
force a kind of scaling

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:90%
onto the apes.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:10%
And no longer was the world
just a natural landscape,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:10%
but you could actually
form a landscape

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.709 align:middle line:10%
and create a landscape yourself.

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: One of the things
that I wrote in my book

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.931 align:middle line:10%
when I dealt with this film
was that a cube has six sides.

00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned, it's
all the possible directions

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:90%
that you can go.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You can only go up, down,
left, right, back, and forward.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.265 align:middle line:84%
And so that cube,
within our level

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of reality, our dimension,
is a limitation upon us.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:90%
We have limitations.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.305 align:middle line:84%
We can't ever get
beyond those movements,

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:90%
those spatial movements.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole film is going
to be about man transcending

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
those limitations, including
the limitations of the body,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of death,
the limitations of time,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and aging, and
spatial relations.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's a
really good point.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Because the cube is our reality.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And by having the
cube pointing up into the sky,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
he's saying that you
can transcend the baser

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
reality that you're living
in now and move upwards.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
scene which is just

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
after this scene, where
he throws the bone up

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
into the air, and it
turns into a spaceship,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is this whole idea that
there's a higher reality.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the next scene, we're
going to look at the way

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that the monolith,
pictured by Kubrick,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.565 align:middle line:84%
actually takes on
a capless pyramid.

00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So I see this
astrological alignment

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
as a throwback to Greek
mythology, to the gods.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And what's weird about this film
is that throughout, I think,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is showing us that we
have these series of alignments

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
at each stage of this
evolutionary process,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
the transition into the new
aeon of man's development,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.642 align:middle line:84%
or like a Kali Yuga, these
long periods or aeons.

00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is, I think,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going to the
direction of just the gods.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
looking at a universe

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
that is something else.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
the fabric of light,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
almost in a kind of
"Matrix" type scenario.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about these alignments?

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And what's he trying to
show us with this pyramid?

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, in the
Hermetic tradition, the universe

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and the body of
man are the same.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:10%
In other words, a proportion
between this part of our arm,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.250 align:middle line:10%
and our wrist, and the
edge of our fingers

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:10%
is, essentially, phi ratio.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so they believed that
there were the sacred numbers.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The moon is 2,160
miles in diameter,

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly the length
of a Zodiacal year, which

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:90%
is 2,160 years.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is 864,000
miles in diameter.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.646 align:middle line:84%
864 is part of this 4,
3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 1, 0,

00:08:04.646 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:90%
8 series of numbers.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But what I really
find interesting,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
especially about that
scene there, was the sun

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and the moon are almost
in impossible positions.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I see the divine mind
that basically rules this

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
cosmos as having some
connection to AI--

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --to the
monolith, and to HAL.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know that, as we'll
see in later incarnations

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of this storyline,
Bowman will actually

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
unite, in the story "3001,"
with HAL, so you have Halman.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes a
transhumanist story.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And my interpretation of it
is just that the divine mind

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:90%
is almost like AI.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like a "Matrix"
sort of situation

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
where man has been
led, gradually,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
through this process to where
he can ascend into apotheosis,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to transcend those
limitations of time and space.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
In the sequel that
Clarke wrote, "3001," you

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
have the further ascent of
man in a transhumanist sense,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
explicitly where
Bowman and HAL unite

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and become Halman, this
new sort of demigod, right?

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've always viewed
this as a series

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
or a process of
initiations or stages

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to where man is literally being
led the whole time, all the way

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.104 align:middle line:84%
back to the primeval period to
this apotheosis, this ascent.

00:09:25.104 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Oh, I think
that's absolutely true.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're at the
ending scene with Bowman

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:84%
in the weird white
room, you can actually

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:84%
hear the aliens, or
whatever they are,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
laughing at him on the
soundtrack, especially when he

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:90%
breaks the wine glass.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that
is Kubrick's rendition

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.989 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of higher IQ
directing our evolution.

00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
any doubt that that's

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I think Kubrick would much
rather have it be a kind of AI

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:90%
than a godlike intelligence.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And it makes more sense.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Because what is the monolith?

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And what is it doing there?

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of
machine, clearly.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's a machine that
emits intelligence.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a machine that
creates intelligent beings,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.770 align:middle line:90%
could take a being and teach it.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:84%
What the Hermetic
tradition is saying,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
why this film was so important
to the Hermetic tradition,

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is that the Hermeticists,
the ancient Egyptians,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the ancient people from India,
and the ancient Daiosts all

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
believed that the universe
was shaped like a man.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And man is
shaped like the universe,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and we are a direct
reflection of each other.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Not a direct-- like
the Christian tradition

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.295 align:middle line:90%
where God made us in his view.

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm saying.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, we're a
reflection, which is

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
different than being the same.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an opposite, and you're
looking back at reality,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing it
slightly distorted

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
because you're looking
at it through a mirror.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.678 align:middle line:84%
In the Platonic
tradition, you have

00:10:53.678 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the macrocosm
and the microcosm,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and so man is the image
of the entire universe.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.147 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always some
level of mystic correspondence.

00:11:02.147 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, there is.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think we
want to look at again

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
is another initiatory
stage of planets aligning.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.794 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to that clip.

00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:15.746 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So once again, the
planets have aligned.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we see
Bowman on his journey outward.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And again, we've got
Ligeti's numinous music playing

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are the moons of
Jupiter that are lining up.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's now at Jupiter,
his mission, of course.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: In their book and
in the original screenplay,

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Stanley had him going to Saturn.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But supposedly,
the rings were too

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
difficult to make by
the effects department,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and so he abandoned it
and switched to Jupiter.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Now it seems odd
to me that Kubrick

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
could have been such a
pioneer in all these effects,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
but couldn't get a ring
to go around a planet

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and make it look good.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know if I buy that.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.875 align:middle line:10%
But what I do buy
is this whole idea

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:10%
of this German secret
society which was put out,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:10%
called "Fire and Ice," which was
about this Saturnian society,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:10%
the Brotherhood of Saturn.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:10%
It was a Germanic group.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the rituals, it listed
in this book, for what you

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
must do to succeed at
coming into communion

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
with the god of Saturn is you
must go through these stages.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:90%
One stage is the primal stage.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Another stage is the moon stage.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Another stage is
the travel stage.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.380 align:middle line:90%
And the fourth stage is arrival.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And these also coincide with
the four levels of the Kabbalah,

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
where Malchut is Earth.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Yesod is the moon.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Tiferet is Saturn or the sun.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be both.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Keter
at the top, where

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.992 align:middle line:84%
you become one with the
universal intelligence.

00:13:07.992 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: The crown, the deity.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is you
have to pass through an abyss

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.210 align:middle line:90%
to get to there.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And
Bowman clearly passes

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
through an abyss, which is
the lights plunging downwards.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we can see
that it must be

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that Kubrick was very familiar,
not only with the Kabbalah,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:84%
but with the rituals of
the Brotherhood of Saturn.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see later in our
examination of "Eyes Wide

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Shut," he's continuing this--

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
not an expose.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like he's in
it, he's in this group,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to show their
rituals, their attainments,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
their goals, and everything,
in both of these films.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that these
are the two of, actually,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Kubrick's most personal films.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I know it seems odd to
say that "2001" in any way

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
could be a personal
film, but I think

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
it's the story of Kubrick's
own transformation.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Because all art is really
disguised autobiography.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is
what he was trying to say,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that he went through
these rituals

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.172 align:middle line:90%
and became one with Saturn.

00:14:08.172 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he
was probably a little

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
pissed off that he couldn't use
Saturn, that the powers that be

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
said, no, you're going too far.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to release all
of our secrets in this film.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We can't have you do that.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.309 align:middle line:90%
Switch it out.

00:14:20.309 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to
Arthur C. Clarke,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.641 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to switch it
out, but you keep it

00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
the same in the novel.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
they kept it the same.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So basically,
the initiatory process

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about is aimed

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:84%
at transcending beyond
Kronos or Titan.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.857 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The deity in
charge of time and space,

00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the limitations of that
cube that we talked.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Because with a cube, which,
if you turn it on its side,

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
is a hexagon, which is the
traditional symbol of Saturn.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
That process, though,
is aimed at trying

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.475 align:middle line:84%
to transcend these limitations,
that initiatory process.

00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's going
to happen to Bowman.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
When Bowman enters
into the stargate,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
he's going to see this dazzling,
psychedelic light show that's

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the fabric or
structure of reality.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he's going to
see these Platonic forms,

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.192 align:middle line:90%
Pythagorean forms.

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to
look at that clip

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
of him entering the stargate.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So while I understand that this
is far prior to "The Matrix,"

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I read this as the
universe itself being

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:90%
constructed in a Platonic way.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That there's this
three-dimensional cubic reality

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about
that limits us, and here is

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Bowman moving out of that.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can go all the way
back to Plato's dialogues,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
like the "Timaeus," which
is his creation account.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how he knew this,

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
or Socrates knew this,
or whoever, but somehow,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
way before microscopes,
they posited the theory

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that the lowest levels of
reality are actually formal,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:90%
that they have form.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at,
like a benzene ring,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
it has that hexagonal
structure to it.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So how they knew
that, I don't know.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's always
been this sense maybe contained

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
within comparative religion,
the religious traditions,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
the Hermetic traditions,
that reality really

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:90%
is this structure.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It really does have
this architecture.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.215 align:middle line:84%
It's a fabric of
light in a way, much

00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
like what we see
in "The Matrix,"

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
and that it can be transcended.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.219 align:middle line:84%
There are other
planes of existence.

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I consider "The
Matrix" is really the "2001--

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
A Space Odyssey"
for Generation X.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's really that kind of
transformational type of film.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
were, in some ways,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
consciously borrowing things
from "2001," the Wachowskis.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
What Kubrick seems
to be telling us

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.685 align:middle line:84%
is that even though he's
going over this abyss,

00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
or through this abyss,
that the inner dimensions

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
of this reality
are made of light.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.826 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And what's
interesting about the sequence

00:17:04.826 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
we just saw is he starts
out with oranges, and reds,

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and all these lower
chakra colors.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly, he passes
into the upper chakra colors

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of blue and purples,
which means he's

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
transiting from the lower,
the base, the monkey

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.579 align:middle line:84%
mind, to the mind
of the Star Child

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
while he's going
through this transition.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's ever
been a more amazing 18 minutes

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
of transition in cinema
history than this sequence

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:90%
here that we just saw.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, and the
reason that I continued

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to discuss those
planetary alignments is

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.669 align:middle line:84%
that I saw it as connected
to this seminal scene

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
towards the end, where
we're actually going

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to see seven diamonds appear.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Now this, I think, has
mystified a lot of people.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
But my theory is that, if
you go to the ancient world,

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
if you go to ancient
writers, Aristotle,

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
if you look at Plato,
the way that they talked

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
about the celestial
sphere is that there

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
were seven planetary
rulers or gods, right?

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And these seven
main planets, so to speak,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
are what determines,
astrologically,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
man's destiny, man's future,
the fates, and so forth.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And Plato discusses this at
the very end of the "Republic."

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:10%
There's this really
weird, mystical allegory

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:10%
where he talks about
this giant clock,

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:10%
that the universe is kind
of like a giant clock,

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:10%
and the planets are
moving and so forth.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I see this
as Bowman basically

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
moving out of the
particularizations of forms

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that we experience in
our everyday reality,

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and he's transiting into the
more abstract, ideal realm

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
that Plato talked about
of forms in general.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Blue into blueness,
redness, right?

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And then the
forms, the geometric forms,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that Pythagoras talked
about, diamonds and so forth.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.117 align:middle line:84%
And I see these as the
seven planetary rulers.

00:18:56.117 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, they are.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, seven
is, in some ways,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the functioning measure
of our universe.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The moon travels in
seven cycles of 28 days.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:90%
The week is seven days.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:90%
We measure time in seven.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It's seven chakras.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many sevens
in esoteric tradition.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's, in some
ways, the main number

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
of esoteric traditions.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
you're seeing here also

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is we're moving from the
universe of light, which is

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.619 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the universe--

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:29.493 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes, exactly.

00:19:29.493 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: To
concretized universe,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
where the diamond is, of
course, a form of carbon,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's solid, and
they're octagonal-shaped,

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%
which is a pyramid times two.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this is the
point where Bowman is now

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
moving from the etheric
universe to the more

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
concretized universe as a
renewed, transformed being.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned seven
in terms of diamonds,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and it also made me think of
when you mentioned earlier,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.275 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, well, in Jewish
tradition in general,

00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:84%
you have the idea
of the Sabbath.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And this is what
Bowman's about to enter into.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be suddenly quite
old, an aged man, in this Louis

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
XVI or XVII setting,
almost like a halfway house

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
before the next
phase of Star Child.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.282 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes a
kind of Sabbath for him.

00:20:20.282 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I also
want to point out

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients or
Hermetic tradition believe

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
there were seven
planets, and that Saturn

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
was the outermost planet, and
that it governed time, Kronos.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Oh, OK.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think
that what Bowman does

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is he transmutes
time too at the end.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes, exactly.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: With getting
older and then turning

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
into a Star Child, we
really don't know how long

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:90%
he has been in this room.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how long this
transition's going to be.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't seem
to pass from one age

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.591 align:middle line:90%
to another in a gradual way.

00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: No, it's just instant.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Sudden leaps.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
Kubrick is well

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
aware of why seven is one of
the most important numbers

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
in the Hermetic traditions,
in the Kabbalic traditions.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing us
in the scene that--

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, right.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --pay attention,
because those who pay attention

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.945 align:middle line:90%
will learn.

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:10.745 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:21:10.745 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And one of the founders
of modern physical theory

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:10%
or quantum physics,
Werner Heisenberg,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:10%
actually has a
famous essay where

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:10%
he talks about how the
lowest level of reality that

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.494 align:middle line:10%
could be looked at in his
time, in the '50s or '60s,

00:21:24.494 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:10%
whenever he's writing, he
says that it actually does

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:10%
display these Pythagorean forms.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It does.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you examine
the shapes of galaxies,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
close ups of galaxies,
and you look very closely,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:84%
you can see that, yeah,
they look spirally.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
real close, you can

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
see the Platonian
solids are actually

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
embedded inside the geometry
of galaxies, and universes,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:90%
in the seeds of sunflowers.

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So the idea of sacred
geometry is almost universal.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.502 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It is how the
universe is created.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
It's created by measure.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It's created by the
form and distance

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that things are apart
from each other,

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.417 align:middle line:84%
and those form their own
geometrical relationships.

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So this next
clip, we're going

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.083 align:middle line:90%
to see the seven diamonds.

00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:13.389 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.389 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Bowman is
leading like Odysseus.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Bowman is leading us
through humanity's redemption,

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.674 align:middle line:84%
The great British
psychologist, Julian Jaynes,

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
talks about the difference
between "The Iliad"

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and "The Odyssey," and
how "The Iliad," we

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
were in this
amorphous personhood

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
where the gods were teaching
us and telling us what to do.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Grab that weapon and throw it.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And you think it's Athena
telling you to do this.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in "Odyssey," which
he named his movie consciously

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:90%
after--

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Odysseus now begins
to realize that the gods are

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
not as powerful as
he thought they were,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that they lied to him,
and furthermore, he

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.420 align:middle line:84%
makes better decisions
on his own than they do.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And in "2001-- A
Space Odyssey," Bowman

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
makes the decision
to shut down HAL

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:90%
after HAL makes this screw up.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And now Bowman, who
has been this amorphous

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
individual the
whole entire movie--

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
just shadowboxing and
playing chess, and really

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:90%
kind of a bland human being--

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:90%
now he's seizing control.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And it always takes
a traumatic incident

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.016 align:middle line:90%
to begin this self-realization.

00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:19.816 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.316 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And
again, this is Bowman

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
going through his own
self-realization, which

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
is really us going through our
collective self-realization

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of a larger
whole, that there are exterior

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
forces which have a huge
influence on us which we do not

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge, and that
in the end, if we

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
give in to those forces, they
will actually take care of us.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There's not a whole lot we can
do about where we're going.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.481 align:middle line:84%
We got to just have to go along
for the ride like Bowman does.

00:23:50.481 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, the technical
aspects of this film also,

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, should
be mentioned too.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: They should be.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Because this was such
an achievement for this time.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And this was what,
I've read, led

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
him to be affiliated with NASA.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:10%
There are actual documentation--

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:10%
there's documentary
proof, photos of him

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.190 align:middle line:10%
with Mueller of the head
of NASA at the time.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And maybe
this deal was struck

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:10%
that he could use the ZEISS
lens to film "Barry Lyndon"

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.384 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:24:13.384 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Absolutely.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:10%
There was a lot of fraternizing
between the "2001" set

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:10%
and Houston, shooting Apollo,
people going back and forth,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:10%
advising Kubrick,
and probably Kubrick

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:10%
advising them in some ways.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, really, the
production values in this film

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
can't be overemphasized for how
revolutionary they really were.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the effects
Kubrick did were physical,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:90%
even what we just saw.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Those are physical effects.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Those are not animations.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Douglas Trumbull actually
used a split screen machine

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Those are actually works
of art that are sliding by,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.036 align:middle line:90%
guys are sliding them by.

00:24:54.036 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
there's a machine--

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Those are real heavenly
diamonds that came down

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:90%
from the cos-- no, I'm joking.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, they're
the stars from heaven.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:10%
And then also the fact that
Kubrick, using the front screen

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:10%
projection both for
the outer space scenes

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:10%
and for the ape
scenes, he really

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:10%
became the world's expert
at front screen projection.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
revolutionary techniques

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:84%
being used in this
film, it seems

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
hard to believe that it
could come from just one guy,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:90%
but it did.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And even the models, Lucas,
and Spielberg, and everybody

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:84%
learned how to shoot
models from this movie.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And every great
science fiction movie,

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
from "Alien" to
"Close Encounters,"

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:90%
has an homage to this movie.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.054 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a reason for that.

00:25:43.054 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, a lot
of times, the people

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
who oppose those who question
the moon landing and whatnot,

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:84%
they say that there was
not technology at this time

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to fake this.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it
had to have been

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
as was presented to us on
television and so forth.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
here, saying, look

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
how realistic these moon
scenes and a lot of this

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
looks, even for--

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
1969?

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: '68.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: '68.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
This looks realistic
for that time.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Most
people do not really

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
understand how movies are made.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:90%
They think they do know.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize the
complexity of setting up.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:10%
Some of just the basic
shots that we've seen here

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:10%
took 18, 20 hours just to set
up for 5, 10 seconds of footage.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the day of CGI,
this is not appreciated.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:10%
But I was in that world for a
long time, of physical effects,

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:10%
and I know how
difficult they are.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And to pull it off
like he pulled it off,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
especially only having
done effects in a few shots

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
in "Dr. Strangelove,"
his previous film,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to be this far advanced
is really amazing.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It proves that Kubrick really
was a genius, 200 IQ type

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.280 align:middle line:90%
genius.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in the
next clip, we have

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.710 align:middle line:84%
the hotel in space, or the
halfway house, between here

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:58.554 align:middle line:90%
and Star Child.

00:26:58.554 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at that.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So is this like the famous
painting of Michelangelo,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.974 align:middle line:84%
of touching the
finger of God, right?

00:27:15.974 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: I think so.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And then "ET"
does that too, right?

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think he's
touching the--

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
he's realizing, not
only his own death,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
but that the
monolith is actually

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:84%
responsible for everything
that's been going on.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:10%
It should be pointed out that
Kubrick was a chess master,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:10%
and could play against 10 people
at once and win every match.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And the whole set looks
like a chess board

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
with the monolith as
the queen, and then he's

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
one of the players.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And he's been called
checkmate on by the monolith--

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Oh, OK.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --at that scene.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.372 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
whole aging process.

00:27:52.372 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting also
about that scene, we missed it,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.311 align:middle line:84%
but he breaks a wine glass
right before that scene begins.

00:27:58.311 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's these little
voices on the soundtrack when

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.392 align:middle line:84%
he does it, going, ah
ah ah, like they're

00:28:02.392 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:90%
laughing at him a little bit.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You can barely hear it,
but you have to listen.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
Kubrick is saying

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.175 align:middle line:84%
there is he's using the breaking
of the wine glass like a zen

00:28:11.175 --> 00:28:11.975 align:middle line:90%
koan.

00:28:11.975 --> 00:28:12.775 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: It's to
bust your reality,

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:84%
just shatter it immediately
in this contradiction.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And so here he is in
this Louis XVI hotel

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:84%
room, which looks like
the aliens pulled it out

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of his skull because he went to
a museum or something one time

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and thought this would
be a great place to have.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: To stick him in.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So they stuck him in this
place and then give him, again,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the worst-looking food that
anyone's ever been given,

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.300 align:middle line:84%
which is another
theme of this movie,

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
is how ugly food is,
strangely enough.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's eating, and he
breaks the wine glass.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.515 align:middle line:84%
And then he's transformed
in that moment

00:28:46.515 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
into the Star Child, which is
where he's going next here.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so here, I see this
as him being in between time

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.414 align:middle line:84%
and eternity, he's
in a temporary--

00:28:55.414 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, he is.

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --housing
space, which seems

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to be in his own
mind in some ways.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So he's transcended
bodily limitations,

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:05.122 align:middle line:84%
but he's still captive to
his own self reflection

00:29:05.122 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:90%
of who he thinks he is.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
He sees himself as
this man who was born,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and who passed through
these stages, and who died.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he's still not
completely broken free

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.191 align:middle line:90%
from these limitations.

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so he
still has to be reborn.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a new genesis
coming for him.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is the whole
point of the film,

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is that he will become
self-realized and then become

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.420 align:middle line:90%
a superman.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It's really Nietzsche's--

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's Nietzschean.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.801 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think he's
one of the geniuses

00:29:32.801 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century,
early 20th century.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know Kubrick
really admired him a lot.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.675 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that
Nazism came from Nietzsche,

00:29:40.675 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:90%
but I don't think so.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it was just a
misreading of Nietzsche.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And Nietzsche really did
believe that we were on our way

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to becoming a kind
of superhuman.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think Kubrick
wanted to evoke that,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:84%
but do it in a way that was
filled with mystery so that you

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
had to work to understand
what you were actually seeing.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And in that working, he
initiates you, the viewer.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.449 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Because then
you have to go find out,

00:30:07.449 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
what is a black monolith?

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by this?

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by that?

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And you begin your own
journey, which, I think,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
was the greatest
joy for Kubrick.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Because he would keep
all these letters

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:84%
from intellectual college
kids and things, and he

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:90%
would write back to them.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
No, your interpretation
is wrong.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Use this.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think he liked that.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I think he thought
that was really cool.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.406 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So now
we're going to come

00:30:31.406 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to the climax, which is
the birth of Star Child,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:90%
and we want to see that clip.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:45.512 align:middle line:90%

00:30:56.147 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What
Kubrick has done here,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
brilliantly, is he is not going
to tell you what is going on.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.340 align:middle line:10%
He's going to use
incredible imagery, though,

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:10%
to evoke a feeling in you.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling is going
to teach you something.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that Kubrick uses that
imagery-- and let's face it,

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Star Child looks a
little bit like a Gray.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I think Kubrick started
out just trying to make

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
a regular science fiction film.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I believe politics
got involved at some point,

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and he had a much bigger
budget than he ever

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:84%
thought he would have.
$10 million in 1968,

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:90%
'66, really, was a lot of money.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:10%
There weren't very many films
being made for that much.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.910 align:middle line:10%
He'd never really made
much money as a director,

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:10%
so it's kind of odd that they
would invest that much in it.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: There's a famous
clip from the biography

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
film of Stanley Kubrick,
"Days of Stanley Kubrick,"

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.097 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called,
where the head of MGM

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:84%
is literally saying,
I don't know what

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
the budget to this film is.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:90%
The head of MGM?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the most expensive
film he's making,

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't know
what the budget is?

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It calls into all sorts
of questions as to what's

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:90%
really going on in this film.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, Kubrick came out
the other side of this film

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
with a contract that allowed
him to make any kind of film

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to make for
the rest of his life.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And nobody, not even Spielberg,
has that kind of contract.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:90%
So Kubrick was a master imager.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:84%
He was a photographer
for Look magazine.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
He understood the
power of image.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And he never really
got the chance

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to spend the money to
make the images that he

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.310 align:middle line:84%
could, the iconic images,
that he could in this movie.

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And he used his
resources well, and I

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
think it's really one of the
most beautiful films ever made.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, I think
it's fascinating

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that you could
try to encapsulate

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:84%
the totality of man's
experience, history,

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of what it
is to be man, within one

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:84%
single film like this,
and to include alchemy,

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and to include
comparative religion

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and all these mysteries.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think you made the
comparison in your film

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to him being like
Shakespeare in a way.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The movie
version of Shakespeare.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.021 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He is,
yeah, that's right.

00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Because Shakespeare
was clearly trying

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.527 align:middle line:84%
to convey alchemical
messages inside his plays.

00:33:29.527 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, absolutely.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: But you
weren't really to know it.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.872 align:middle line:84%
So the common guy sitting there,
the groundling, they call him,

00:33:34.872 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
he would not know that
he's just been given all

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:90%
this very high information.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But some people in the
audience would get it.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's exactly
what's happening here.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are not getting it,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
but some people are getting
it, and they're saying,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.350 align:middle line:90%
this is profound.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:84%
This guy actually managed to
do what no one's ever been

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:90%
able to do before or since.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.445 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're doing
Hollywood Decoded.

00:33:54.445 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.678 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There are so
many of these movies

00:33:56.678 --> 00:33:59.342 align:middle line:84%
like this where we don't know
what the heck is going on.

00:33:59.342 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think you actually
can piece it together.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've done that
well with your "Odyssey."

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I think it came
from without, not from within.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But truly, truly,
Stanley Kubrick

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:84%
became one of the greatest
directors with this film,

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.692 align:middle line:84%
I think even Orson Welles
said that after he saw it.

00:34:20.692 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I was going
to ask you, who

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.408 align:middle line:84%
do you think would be up
there, comparable to Kubrick?

00:34:24.408 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:90%
Would it be Orson Welles?

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Hitchcock?

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Orson Welles,
Hitchcock, and Kurosawa.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:90%
They're the greatest.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.790 align:middle line:84%
The reason that those
guys are so good

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:84%
is because they all understood
the technique of filmmaking.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.719 align:middle line:90%
Whereas most people come from--

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
like Billy Wilder, they come
from a theatrical background,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
running plays in New
York or whatever.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.969 align:middle line:84%
And then they come here, and
they apply that knowledge

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.920 align:middle line:90%
to movie making.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick and Kurosawa,
they come out of the image

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:84%
making area of filmmaking,
and then learned how

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.350 align:middle line:90%
to direct actors.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.132 align:middle line:90%
