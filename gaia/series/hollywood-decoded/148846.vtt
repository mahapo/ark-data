00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a deeper, hidden,
more esoteric meaning behind

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the Hollywood films that
we all love to watch?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.150 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Christopher Nolan was who
rebooted the Batman series

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
starting in 2005, and then the
big blockbuster trilogy that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
emerged from that was full
of all kinds of esoteric,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.429 align:middle line:90%
hidden occult meanings.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to do today is dissect that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and look at the interplay
of secret societies

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of giant geopolitical wars
between the East and the West,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
of billionaire capitalists
like Bruce Wayne,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and how this all
kind of operates

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
under the veil of a comic
book story, interestingly.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's a very
mature comic book story.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
In this trilogy, he
does an incredible job.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And the entire
ethos of the trilogy

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:10%
is really of
vigilantism, in a way,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:10%
and how there is a place in
the world for vigilantes.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what's fascinating
for me was I wasn't expecting

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Wayne to get
into a secret society.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Although if you watch the
old series with Adam West,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
referenced in the series

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that his father was a
member of Skull And Bones.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So we get the idea that there is
this secret society background

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:90%
to the character of Batman.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:90%
So what does he do?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, he decides he wants to
go a left hand path, the path

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of darkness and difficulty.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
For his initiation, he
travels to the Far East.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
He's a part of the
secret society.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And he realizes that
he's got to learn

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
the dark arts, the
black side of things,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and that he has got to
learn the skills of a ninja.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So he learns
psychological warfare,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:84%
he learns black magic,
and these kinds of things,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
basically to trick the opponent.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:10%
And he's led into this by this
character of Ra's al Ghul,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:10%
played by Liam Neeson, who is
kind of his handler, in a way.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:10%
He's the head of
this secret society.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.862 align:middle line:84%
But Bruce Wayne doesn't
really know the goals

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:90%
of this secret society.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He's been led up this
ladder of initiation.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.857 align:middle line:84%
His consciousness is being
opened to these new ideas.

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to find
out that in the end,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be
very much opposed

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
to the designs of this secret.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So he's almost, in a way,
a kind of whistleblower

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in that he comes out
of this dark side

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and realizes that
he's got to oppose it.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, the plot is a little
bit like the story of Buddha.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Buddha is a rich kid, of
a very sheltered life.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And then one day he sees
poverty and poor people

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and he immediately
goes on a quest.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Only in the movie, he
goes on the left hand path

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as opposed the path
that Buddha took.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But that would be
the path you would

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
take if you were a rich kid and
everything had been sheltered

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
your whole life and you caused
the death of your parents

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
by your own fears
and being sheltered.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so he's
traumatized and that's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:10%
what causes him to go
down this path, because

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:10%
of the death of his parents.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:10%
And then he also
falls down the well.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.905 align:middle line:10%
So this is also subconscious.

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:15.292 align:middle line:10%
Nolan is evoking all that
Jungian archetype and imagery

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to
look at in this film.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So the first half is
him being initiated

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.695 align:middle line:90%
into this secret society.

00:03:21.695 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Breathe in your fears.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Face them.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:10%
To conquer fear, you
must become fear.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.515 align:middle line:10%
You must bask in the
fear of other men.

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.473 align:middle line:10%
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

00:03:39.473 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Imagine being given your
ninja suit and then breathing

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:10%
in a bunch of--

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Psychedelics.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:10%
>> A bunch of psychedelics.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:10%
Oh, here's 20 ninjas for
you to take on right here.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:10%
>> You have to become
a terrible thought.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.701 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:05.683 align:middle line:10%
A wraith.

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:11.575 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:13.539 align:middle line:10%
You have to become an idea.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the whole point
of this is facing the fear.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And the Nolans, both
Christopher and his brother,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.665 align:middle line:10%
that do these kinds of
stories so many times over

00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:10%
are always using
Jungian archetypes.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:10%
And a big part of Carl
Jung's psychoanalysis

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:10%
was that you had to face up
to the thing that traumatized

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.812 align:middle line:10%
you and scared you the most.

00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it was a death of
somebody, maybe something bad

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:10%
happened to you in your past.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:10%
But facing up to
that is the means

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:10%
by which you overcome that.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And then the fear, the trauma
is then the servant to you.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer a
servant to your fear.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
point of this ritual,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, in the film.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and then later in the
film when he goes back to his

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:10%
house in Gotham, the bats, he
goes back down into the well

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:10%
and faces the bats.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:10%
Only this time he's not afraid.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:10%
And the bats caused his
parents to die, actually,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:10%
because it's a bat character
in the theater play

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:10%
that he's watching that
causes him to get scared.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:10%
And so yeah, he's bringing all
these Jungian archetypes back.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And just that bats are
creatures of the night

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and you can't really see
them and they're quiet

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:10%
and they're blind too.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of interesting
that the bat symbols

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.035 align:middle line:84%
are being used by the Nolans
here as the archetype.

00:05:29.035 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what's interesting
is that when he goes up

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
into the mountains
of Tibet, I think,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and he learns the
secrets of this order,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
he finds out that they have
maybe a darker purpose,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:84%
not what he wants
to be a part of.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.580 align:middle line:10%
So this actually evokes the
ideas of real secret societies.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:10%
Madam Blavatsky is very
famous for going into Tibet

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:10%
and meeting this so-called
Great White Brotherhood

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.905 align:middle line:10%
and they gave her these
secrets and mysteries.

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:10%
And then Aleister Crowley
did the exact same thing,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.488 align:middle line:10%
where he went up
into the mountains

00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:10%
and met with these
Tibetans and felt

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:10%
that he could blend Eastern
and Western mysticism

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:10%
into this secret society
that maybe even felt,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:10%
at times, that Western
society needed to be destroyed

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:10%
to bring balance.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
Ra's al Ghul's character

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:90%
tries to do in this film.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:10%
And they do it not just by
his psychological warfare

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:10%
on Gotham, which represents
America or New York

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:10%
They do it also by drug
warfare, biowarfare.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:10%
So we're actually going to
see that the deep state plans

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.759 align:middle line:10%
that people like
John P. Holdren, who

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:10%
wrote a famous book, "Eco
Science" talking about how we

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:10%
all need to be
drugged and sterilized

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:10%
and so forth for de-population.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
That jives perfectly
with this secret society

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
that Ra's al Ghul's running.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, we see that the
goal of this secret society is

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:90%
the apocalypse.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And they think that the
scourging of the planet

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
is the good thing and
that this is a higher

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:90%
purpose to the apocalypse.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And just like Ra's al
Ghul, he can't understand

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
why Batman can't see the
plan, that actually cities

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
are a bad thing and that
Gotham is a bad thing

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:90%
and it needs to be wiped out.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to see here,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we mentioned Carl
Jung and archetypes,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a positive
aspect to archetypes,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a
dark side to this.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So members of the secret
society here have actually

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:90%
mastered the dark side of it.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They know how to
manipulate archetypes

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of
fear and keeping people

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:90%
imprisoned to their own fears.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.176 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're going to see

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
with the use of pharmacology
by this character who

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is also a member of the dark
society here, Scarecrow.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Scarecrow.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:10%
>> What's scarecrow?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Patients suffering
delusional episodes often focus

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:10%
their paranoia on an
external tormentor.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.910 align:middle line:10%
Usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:10%
In this case, a scarecrow.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:10%
>> He's drugged?

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Psycho pharmacology
is my [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm a strong advocate.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:10%
Outside he was a giant.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.365 align:middle line:10%
In here only the mind
can grant you power.

00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:10%
>> You enjoy the reversal.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I respect the mind's
power over the body.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:10%
It's why I do what I do.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So the secret society
knows key members

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
of Gotham's communities,
upstanding citizens,

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to go for as control points
to take down the city.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And then you have this
character Scarecrow

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:10%
who is the archetypal
MKULTRA doctor.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he's saying.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.911 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I know how to
manipulate archetypes.

00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I know how to control
these people's minds

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.502 align:middle line:90%
through their fears.

00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And if I can control their
fears and give them their fears,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.133 align:middle line:90%
I can control them.

00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
what he's doing,

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:90%
and he's using drugs to do it.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we find out
later that they're

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
going to bomb Gotham
with these drugs

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be total chaos.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And that could be a plan,
actually, already thought up

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:90%
in the deep state somewhere.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Because what a perfect
way to take total control

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
than to spread some drug that
causes everybody to freak out.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that the philosophy

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of the secret
society is very Far

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Eastern in the sense of duality.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.565 align:middle line:84%
So they see good and evil as
kind of actually flip sides

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:90%
of the same coin.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:10%
So when Ra's al Ghul
comes to Bruce Wayne

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:10%
to try to justify
what he's doing,

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.141 align:middle line:10%
he's burning down Wayne
manor, and he's like,

00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:10%
don't you understand
that it all has

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:10%
to be burned down because that's
just what needs to happen,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to
restore balance.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's when Bruce Wayne
is really figuring out

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.862 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't buy into
the negative aspects

00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
of this secret society.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
He realizes he's
got to fight it.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's who
he's going to fight

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.283 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole series
is this same secret society.

00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's very interesting
because many people

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that the
entire attack by Genghis Khan

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:84%
on Europe, that the entire
attack when Genghis Khan

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
attacked Europe was that
Genghis Khan thought,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
everyone thinks he's
this horrible guy,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
but actually he thought cities
were evil and that only evil

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.130 align:middle line:84%
could have come out of cities,
and that since the cities were

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
really big in Europe, that's
why they needed to be wiped out.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was his
whole philosophy.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And Ra's al Ghul has
that same philosophy.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
He's coming from the East,
learning the arts of the East,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and now he wants
to conquer the city

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and destroy it because
there's nothing there

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.284 align:middle line:90%
but pernicious evil.

00:10:11.284 --> 00:10:12.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the League
of Shadows secret society

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The League of Shadows has
been a check against human

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:10%
corruption for
thousands of years.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:10%
We sacked Rome, loaded trade
ships with plague rats,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:10%
burned London to the ground.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Every time a
civilization reaches

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:10%
the pinnacle of
its decadence, we

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:10%
return to restore the balance.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Gotham isn't beyond saving.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:10%
Give me more time.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:10%
There are good people here.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:10%
>> You are defending a city
so corrupt we have infiltrated

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:10%
every level of its
infrastructure.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this clip here,
he lays out the philosophy.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you notice
the same thing that I

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
put in my book
about this section

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.132 align:middle line:84%
was that this is the
Rothschild house.

00:10:51.132 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So that needs to be mentioned,
because so many weird things

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.756 align:middle line:90%
have happened in this house.

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if Christopher
Nolan didn't choose it

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:90%
for that reason.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of esoteric stuff.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles actually did
transcendental meditation

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi in this mansion.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think Bruce Wayne has
this mansion for a reason.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And here in the middle of it
is this character Ra's al Ghul

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%
with this dark philosophy.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that Christopher
Nolan's a huge Kubrick fan,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and Kubrick used the same house
I believe in "Eyes Wide Shut"

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
where the orgy took place.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
a nod to Kubrick

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
also, that he
understands what he's

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
saying, just a few years
earlier when that film came out.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.294 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that Ra's al
Ghul thinks he's a good guy.

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
have to understand.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.918 align:middle line:10%
Even though he is a bad guy--

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Just like the Joker, he
thinks chaos is a necessary

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:10%
thing.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:10%
This dualism.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is the whole point
of Nolan's kind of dichotomy

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
between vigilantism and chaos.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
How far can a vigilante go
to stop the chaos before he

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes an agent of
chaos, which he'll

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:90%
get into in the later versions.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.259 align:middle line:84%
But that's the crux of what
Nolan is trying to say here.

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think is really
interesting about Nolan

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:84%
as a director is that so many
times not only does he like

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to play with Jungian archetypes,
but he's obsessed with

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the labyrinth, the
image of a maze.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's even in
his company's symbol.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we watch these films,
if we think about something

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
like "Inception,"
there it is actually

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
a labyrinth that is the psyche.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.337 align:middle line:84%
And the psyche in its trip
into the lowest levels

00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:10%
If you remember Cobb, the
Leonardo DiCaprio character,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:10%
he has to go down to the
basement of his subconscious,

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:10%
of his soul, and
meet with Mal, which

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:10%
is kind of the Latin word
for maliciousness or evil,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:10%
this former wife character that
he's had a very hard time with.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
He didn't get along
with her and that

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%
is the source of his trauma.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
that film, he's

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
layers down, stuck in
this kind of dream world.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about him
finding his way out

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
through facing his trauma.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, other films,
it just amazes me

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that Nolan consistently pulls
this off in such a good way.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.144 align:middle line:84%
He repeats it, but
he pulls it off.

00:13:13.144 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:10%
Think about "The
Prestige," for example.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:10%
In "The Prestige" what Nolan
does is he has the doubling.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, he's got two
Christian Bale characters.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing is,
it's all about illusions.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's that
famous scene where

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to figure out
how this act is pulled off

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:84%
by this Chinese magician,
who is hobbling around

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and they can't figure out where
he produces this magical bowl

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:90%
that he's got.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Bales
says, he does it,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
he pulls it off because
he lives his routine.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:90%
He lives his act.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
He's so committed
to his act that it's

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:90%
a daily thing for him.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So here we have that
idea of method acting.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what so
much of Hollywood

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
has become dominated by
in the last few decades

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:90%
is method acting.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
about, as Stanislavski

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
says, you losing
consciousness and letting

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.741 align:middle line:84%
something from the subconscious
come up and take over you.

00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
This is what Plato
talked about when

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
he argued with the
philosophers of his day

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and the actors of his day.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a famous
dialogue called Ion

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
where they talked about
losing their conscious mind

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and giving it over
to something else.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:10%
So what I see Nolan as,
and even in "Interstellar,"

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:10%
is he's mining the
subconscious through his films.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the real
labyrinth and psyche

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're having to solve is
the mind and the subconscious.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, because one
of the subplots for the whole

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Batman series is that
Michael Caine, his butler,

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is very worried that Bruce
Wayne is going to become Batman.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:90%
You've become this character.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
He keeps warning him,
what are you doing?

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this?

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You're going way too far.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
that the actors face.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
this in other shows

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and why actors fall in love
with each other on the set

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and then after the movie's over,
they aren't in love anymore.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's because they've
become that character.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And that character that, oh,
I have to love this person

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.621 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
my love is sincere.

00:15:16.621 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
This happened, actually,
to Christian Bale

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
on the set of a
"Terminator" movie where

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:90%
he became the tough guy.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is this famous clip
of him yelling and screaming

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
at the cinematographer
and he's the tough guy.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And then he even says later
when he apologizes to the guy,

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I was so into my role that
I couldn't get out of it.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:10%
And so I think this is a
really big thing in Hollywood

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:10%
and a big psychological
problem that people

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:10%
like Lynch and Christopher
Nolan are addressing

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:10%
is this immersion
into this role.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And Batman gets so
immersed into the role

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:90%
that he does destructive things.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you remember even
Jack Nicholson warned Heath

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:10%
Ledger about the
role of the Joker.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And then he says, if you
do that in a method acting

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:10%
away and immerse yourself
in the role of the Joker,

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.180 align:middle line:10%
it almost seems to bring out
dark things in your psyche.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.315 align:middle line:84%
And not too long after
that, Heath Ledger's

00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:11.635 align:middle line:84%
in a movie, a
Terry Gilliam film,

00:16:11.635 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
"Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"
and he's part of a ritual

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.020 align:middle line:90%
in the movie and he dies.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And then in real life,
we see Heath Ledger died.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So lot of suspicious, weird
things going on there.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this is
the reality of playing

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:90%
with the subconscious.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think our
psyches are precious.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is
something that's a gift to us,

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%
it's precious.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:10%
We can't just play with it and
be like the Scarecrow character

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:10%
who wants to be the
doctor [INAUDIBLE] who's

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:10%
going to bomb everybody's
minds on drugs

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:10%
and manipulate these
shades, the union

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.671 align:middle line:10%
archetypes to try
to control people.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly
what the Pentagon

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
does through the war on terror.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
All it is is a
manipulation of things

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:90%
that we're supposed to fear.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
What's that famous documentary
by Adam Curtis about power

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%
of nightmares, I think?

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
manipulation of the things

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:90%
that the culture itself fears.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:90%
If it bleeds, it leads.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the news
media, Hollywood,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
they're all trying to
terrify us from the start.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:84%
And then we're supposed to
somehow deal with reality

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
after they've scared the
living crap out of all of us.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is another thing
that Scarecrow is trying to do.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:10%
He realizes that he can
manipulate everybody

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:10%
through fear.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.047 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the great
thing about this movie

00:17:24.047 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:10%
is he gets a dose of his
own medicine by the end

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:10%
and he sees the
fearful world that he

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:10%
has created for himself.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Now he sees it.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, Nolan
is very concerned

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
about archetypes and
the destructive behavior

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of the military
industrial complex.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he uses that
throughout his films.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:10%
And he will get into these
falling into archetypes as we

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:10%
go forward with the
Joker and with Bane,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:10%
who also falls into a role.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And even Michael Caine plays
the role of a very helpful sage

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Michael Caine is the old sage.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
He's the conscience
to Bruce Wayne.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Lucius, Morgan
Freeman, is going to be

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
the kind of dark knowledge
of technology figure.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
He's like Bruce
Wayne's Black Ops

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:90%
division of his corporation.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
He runs it.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows what he does.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the reason that
Christopher and Jonathan are

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
so good at telling stories is
the mastery of these Jungian

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:90%
archetypes.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you control
not just fictional stories

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
but also from the dark side,
the way the Pentagon tries

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:90%
to control us.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.639 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
positive aspect here

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:34.100 align:middle line:84%
is that if we understand
Jungian psychology,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
we can really tear
away a lot of the stuff

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed
to be afraid of.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and Batman himself
in the movie uses terror too,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.584 align:middle line:90%
to cause fear for his opponents.

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The famous scene where
he's knocking out

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
the mob near the
beginning of the scene.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:10%
One by one, he's pulling
them up and they don't even

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.652 align:middle line:10%
know what it is
that's attacking them.

00:18:56.652 --> 00:18:58.616 align:middle line:10%
[SCREAMING]

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.976 align:middle line:10%
>> Where were the
other drugs going?

00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:06.776 align:middle line:10%
>> I never knew.

00:19:06.776 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is what he learned
in Ra's al Ghul's secret

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:10%
initiation.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> How to you use
fear as an advantage.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we go forward, we'll
see that works less and less

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:90%
for him as he goes forward.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
His ability to scare and
intimidate his opponents

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
starts lessening and
lessening, and he

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
has to rely on his own
wits and his brute strength

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to get him through to the end.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.834 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also interesting
that he's a vigilante too.

00:19:32.834 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not just Ra's al
Ghul that's a vigilante.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Wayne realizes that,
because I think he is

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.252 align:middle line:90%
so wealthy...

00:19:39.252 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
billionaire, trillionaire
capitalist at the top

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:10%
of this empire, he can see
that Gotham is corrupt.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
The cops are corrupt.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:10%
That's also an important
part of the storyline,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.201 align:middle line:10%
if you remember the
cops are corrupt.

00:19:49.201 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:90%
We saw this with Chinatown.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
This is another theme
that comes up often

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the normal channels
of where we go to have issues

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:90%
solved.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:90%
The court system even.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Judges can be corrupted.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.156 align:middle line:90%
>> They're all corrupt.

00:20:00.156 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the message here?

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It's that we can't just
rely on someone else.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to
take responsibility

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:90%
for our own lives.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.263 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
choose to exit out

00:20:08.263 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of this system of fear and
all this stuff, opt out of it,

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:90%
go for a more natural lifestyle.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
message of all of this.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
that in the end,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I think the Batman character
realizes this and that he needs

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
an escape out of the situation
that he's been placed in.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>> My takeaway from
"Batman Begins"

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:84%
is predictive programming and
getting the deeper message

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't always come from
Hollywood or from famous

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:90%
novels.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It also comes from
something that

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
was for a long time considered
very low class, very vulgar:

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.627 align:middle line:90%
comic books.

00:20:41.627 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, there's
a lot of predictive programming

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:90%
in comic books.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was all
kinds of 9/11 stuff

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
prior to 9/11 that showed
the images of the Twin Towers

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
being hit and so forth.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.427 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what you have
with the character of Batman

00:20:55.427 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is Christopher Nolan
taking something that's

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
kind of Pulp Fiction-y
for kids and turning it

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
into a very complex,
very philosophical

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.424 align:middle line:90%
psychological story.

00:21:05.424 --> 00:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And I that's what's most
interesting about it.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And the takeaway,
the message here,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is that the world is
run by secret societies.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:84%
There's good guys, there's
light side, dark side.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.251 align:middle line:84%
There's a real battle going
on out there, whether we're

00:21:17.251 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
conscious of it or not.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we're aware
of those things,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
then we know how to avoid the
dangerous aspects of life.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.602 align:middle line:10%
Like all the chemical,
biological warfare

00:21:27.602 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:10%
in this movie, we
know how to avoid

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:10%
the toxins and the corporate
culture that we live in.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can also avoid being
a captive to mass media

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:90%
fear and psyops.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.209 align:middle line:84%
The manipulation
of the archetypes

00:21:43.209 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of the terrorists
that are everywhere

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:84%
that are going to get us, which
is not a real fear that we

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
should have.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>> What a lot of people don't
realize is that the original

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Batman comic book series and
this movie is consciously based

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:10%
on the autobiography
of Teddy Roosevelt.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:10%
And Teddy Roosevelt was a very
wealthy kid who lived in a very

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:10%
upscale environment,
very protected.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
He went out West when
he was a young man.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
He got beat up in New
York by a bunch of thugs.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And he was weak.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And he forced himself
to initiate himself

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
by going out West
and becoming a man.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back, he
became the Police Commissioner

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.282 align:middle line:90%
of New York City.

00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one of
the main characters

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is the Police Commissioner
in New York City.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this is also about the
initiation of the individual,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
taking them from a
safe environment,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
moving into an
unsafe environment,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and then coming back and making
this safe environment even

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
safer.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> What does Nietzsche say?

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
What doesn't kill me
only makes me stronger.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this movie is about.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
What I like about
where they take

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
this is that we're
going to progress

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.369 align:middle line:84%
from this story into something
that's even more complex

00:22:55.369 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and tries to bring in a
whole lot of new concepts

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
like the idea the syndicalist,
the Marxist syndicalist

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
of the character of Bane,
and in the chaotic evil

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:90%
of the character of the Joker.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:10%
So I think that he
doesn't just give us

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:10%
the bad guy like Ra's al Ghul.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We get something that
just kind of goes crazy.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
Joker's supposed to embody

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is that evil that's doing evil
for no apparent reason, which

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
is more, I think, fearful
than the idea of just

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.284 align:middle line:84%
a terrorist who's part
of some radical cause.

00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:84%
He has a manifesto, we
know why he's doing it.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why the Joker
is doing all this bombing

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:90%
hospitals and doing crazy stuff.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So I like that wild
aspect of the villain.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, Nolan is a
very mature director.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And everything about
him is, there's not

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
really any childishness
going on here.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
He takes a comic book,
which is ostensibly

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
written for young
males, and he's

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:90%
turned it into a great film.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the cinematography,
the lighting, the soundtrack

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:90%
is amazing.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:84%
He really, I think,
rebooted this whole thing

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:90%
in such a mature way.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that
even more mature views

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of the world in the next two.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
