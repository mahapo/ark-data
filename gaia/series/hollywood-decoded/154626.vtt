>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.670 align:middle line:84%
behind the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:90%

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.617 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "Interstellar" is a film
from Christopher Nolan that's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.145 align:middle line:90%
about a lot of things.

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It's about life, love, mistakes.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.955 align:middle line:90%
It's about other dimensions.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about planes of existence
beyond our four dimensions.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's fascinating
about this film is that it's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:90%
also a tribute to "2001--

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
A Space Odyssey."

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think Nolan
takes a different track

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:90%
than Kubrick does.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a more positive track.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And in this, we have AI
that actually works together

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
with humanity to lead
to a positive future.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.473 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I
think it definitely

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:90%
is Nolan's tribute to "2001."

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it had a
huge influence on him.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The allegories between
this movie and "2001"

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
are way over the top.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:90%
The AI looks like the monolith.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they go out to
Saturn where the stargate is,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what
happens to Bowman,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
only they switched it to
Jupiter because they couldn't

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:90%
make Saturn look right.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
But Nolan got it to look right.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's
rumors from insiders

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that there is a stargate
out near Saturn.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I saw the movie,
I was kind of stunned

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
that Nolan somehow
intuitively knew

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
what insiders were telling me
in private, that they discovered

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.585 align:middle line:90%
some kind of stargate out there.

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a more
optimistic view than "2001--

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:90%
A Space Odyssey."

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
world isn't ending in "2001--

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
A Space Odyssey," whereas
in this film, the Earth

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
is literally dying.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's optimistic in the sense
that it's almost like humans

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:90%
are impelled to go elsewhere.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Can we terraform other planets?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Is our destiny to actually
populate the universe

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.489 align:middle line:84%
and not just stay confined
under the dominance of time?

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That's another aspect
of this film is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:90%
that it's a race against time.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a race against gravity.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have time, gravity,
spatial limitations,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the same themes that Kubrick
was dealing with in "2001."

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And can we transcend those
to move onto something

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:90%
else, something better perhaps?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think he wants to give
us the possibility of that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.734 align:middle line:90%
being done through AI.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
different approach

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
than an AI that wants
to nuke the planet,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
like in the original
"2001" script

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
from Arthur C.
Clarke and Kubrick.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's
revelatory on numerous levels,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
maybe even there's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
a nod to your work, right,
with the reference to,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:90%
did we go to the moon?

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.421 align:middle line:84%
And that the government
scientists actually

00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
included this in the textbooks
for the children, which

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.602 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: It is
fascinating that--

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in my own
personal work, of course,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:10%
I've connected the
making of "2001"

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.761 align:middle line:10%
with the faking of the
Apollo moon program.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they
didn't go to the moon.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that what
they showed us was fake.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And I found it astonishing
that in a movie, which

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is so clearly a tribute to
the works of Stanley Kubrick

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and to "2001," that we would
have this reference to the fact

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:90%
that we faked the moon landing.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's go watch that
clip right now.

She's really bright,
but she's been

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.901 align:middle line:90%
having a little trouble lately.

00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
She brought this in to show
the other students the section

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:90%
on the lunar landings.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.812 align:middle line:84%
- Yeah, it's one of
my old textbooks.

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.199 align:middle line:90%
She always loved the pictures.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:90%
- It's an old federal textbook.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We've replaced them with
the corrected versions.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
- Corrected?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
- Explaining how the
Apollo missions were faked

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%
to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

- You don't believe
we went to the moon?

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
- I believe it was a
brilliant piece of propaganda,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that the Soviets bankrupted
themselves pouring resources

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
into rockets and other
useless machines.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:90%
- Useless machines.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
- And if don't want a
repeat of the excess

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and wastefulness of
the 20th century,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
then we need to teach our
kids about this planet,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.384 align:middle line:90%
not tales of leaving it.

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So here we
have the presentation

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
of a near distant
future, wherein

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Earth has kind of reverted
to an agrarian society,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and we're back to farming.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't need engineers.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't need
technology anymore.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
NASA is done with.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no more space program.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all been put away.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And Cooper plays
this character who

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is very interested in continuing
the progress of technology,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%
that we don't have to revert.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.729 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to become
Luddites or anything like that.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:90%
We can do it in a positive way.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.145 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's very
concerned for his daughter

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
not finding the
appropriate outlet

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:90%
for her scientific gifts.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.905 align:middle line:84%
And so what they get
from the establishment,

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
the mainline workers out there,
is that, no, we don't need you.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be farmers.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I like the fact that
he is sticking to his guns.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:90%
He's rebellious.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
He wants to be--

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
he's intent on continuing
man's progress.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's revelatory
also of the fact

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.112 align:middle line:84%
that we've been lied to when
it comes to this Apollo stuff.

00:05:10.112 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, also
another interesting thing

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.861 align:middle line:84%
is she calls the machines
they're building,

00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Russia is building, as useless,
as if the rockets weren't

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:90%
really going anywhere.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
interesting about this scene

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
is that they're rejecting NASA
as if it really didn't exist.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:90%
It was just a big fake thing.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we find out
right after this scene

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.879 align:middle line:84%
that there is a NASA,
that it still exists.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Black budget,
secret space program.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Black budget, secret
space program, and Cooper

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
goes and joins that.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, right, yeah.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
The background to
why this is happening

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
is that there's been some
kind of blight that's

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.162 align:middle line:84%
affected the Earth, and we
don't know for sure what it is.

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It might have been GMO.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It might have been
chemtrails, geoengineering.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:90%
We're never told.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But something's happening to
create basically a new Dust

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Bowl, right?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
All of the world presumably,
America, is a new Dust Bowl.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So these crops are having
a hard time growing,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:90%
and so they're suspicious.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to find
out is that we might even

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.196 align:middle line:90%
have to leave the Earth.

00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We might have to terraform
some other planet.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that even possible?

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.176 align:middle line:84%
And how are we going to do that
with the problem of gravity?

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But gravity is going to function
on multiple levels here.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
physical force of gravity.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
The gravity of this film
that is triumphant is love.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the love between
Murph and Cooper.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Murph thinks that
she's lost her father.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:90%
He's like Odysseus.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:90%
He's like Bowman.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:90%
He's gone.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Will he come back?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.409 align:middle line:84%
And it's love that
transcends space and time

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:90%
to send the message in the end.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But let's get to that
here in a minute.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this next clip.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
"We're NASA."

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:90%
- We're NASA.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:90%
- NASA?

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.595 align:middle line:90%
- NASA.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
The same NASA you flew for.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
- I heard they
shut you down, sir,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.895 align:middle line:84%
for refusing to drop
bombs in the stratosphere

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:90%
on the starving people.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
- Well, when they realized that
killing other people was not

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
a long-term solution, then
they needed us back, in secret.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:90%
- Why secret?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
- Because public opinion
wouldn't allow spending

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
on space exploration, not
when you're struggling

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
to put food on the table.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Blight-- wheat, seven
years ago, okra this year.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Now there's just corn.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
- And we're growing
more than we ever have.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
- Well, but like the
potatoes in Ireland

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.448 align:middle line:84%
and the wheat in the Dust
Bowl, the corn will die soon.

00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So in
the 1970s, there

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
was a book and a
documentary that came out

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
called "Alternative 3."

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:10%
It was a very interesting book.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It was purported to be
real, but it was fake.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But what "Alternative
3" was saying

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
was that the Earth
was dying, and that we

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
had three alternatives to
mitigate this dying Earth.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The first alternative was to
blow a hole in the atmosphere.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
No kidding, to let
the pollution out.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Alternative two was to build
deep underground military bases

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and go down under there and
wait the whole thing out.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Alternative three was to leave
the planet, find other planets

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:90%
and terraform them.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going on in this
movie is alternative three.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.533 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, yeah.

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.466 align:middle line:84%
And it's a secret
underground base.

00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we had
this initial scene

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
this drone that seemed

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:90%
to have a life of its own.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's Murph, the
daughter, that suspects

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
something more is going on.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Cooper eventually
clues into this.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It leads them to NASA.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would this unmanned
drone lead them to NASA?

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we later figure out that
the AI of the future, which

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
is what saved both Cooper,
right, and Earth ultimately,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
it's sending messages
back in a kind

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%
of synchronistic, mystical way.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's actually speaking through
this more primitive drone

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
version of itself.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the AI that is the kind of
God-figure in this film that's

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.575 align:middle line:84%
leading the characters towards
the salvation of humanity.

00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it
seems to be a theme

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.866 align:middle line:84%
that we seem to have
a lot in "Hollywood

00:09:12.866 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Decoded" of a message
from the future trying

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to help the dystopian
past or a message

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
from the past to try to
help the dystopian future.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
AI from the future

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
is trying to solve the problems
that are happening in the past.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And in the end, it is actually--

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:90%
it succeeds.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.957 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So this
next clip is, now

00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
tell me what your plan
is to save the world.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.206 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're going
to get Michael Caine's going

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to save the world with his
[? overcoat ? ] of bloody

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.526 align:middle line:90%
gravity.

00:09:40.526 --> 00:09:41.418 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:44.765 align:middle line:84%
- OK, now you need
to tell me what

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:47.396 align:middle line:90%
your plan is to save the world.

00:09:47.396 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
- We're not meant
to save the world.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:90%
We're meant to leave it.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:10%
- Rangers.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
- The last components of
our one versatile ship

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.190 align:middle line:84%
in orbit, the Endurance,
our final expedition.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
- You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:90%
- The Lazarus missions.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
- Lazarus came
back from the dead.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
- Sure, but he had to
die in the first place.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There's not a planet
in our solar system

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:90%
that could sustain life.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And the nearest star's
over 1,000 years away,

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't even
qualify as futile.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: This is the
Lazarus mission.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So obviously we're thinking of
the Bible and the resurrection

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of Lazarus, right?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Jesus raises Lazarus
from the dead.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
here is that we've

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
got to perhaps send someone
into the stargate, which

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is, in the film, as you
said, located near Saturn.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, we've talked about
many times, is death.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It is Cronus.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:90%
It is time.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the binding of us
within spatial relations.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And how are we going to
overcome that, right?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick played and toyed
with that notion in "2001."

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Nolan is offering a
different answer here.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's that we can get past that,
not just through technology.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But again, the important
aspect of this film

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.165 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the love
between Murph and Cooper

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that overcomes and solves
the mystery of gravity

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
or the binding force of gravity
that ultimately saves humanity.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a race against
time and death.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It is.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, eventually
Cooper, in a way,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
psychically reunites with
Murph through the tesseract--

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.403 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: --near the end.

00:11:24.403 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- which,
I think, is one

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
of the most brilliant
evocations of kind

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry
and alchemical

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:90%
concepts in movie history.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Murph rejects Cooper

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.055 align:middle line:84%
because he left and
won't come back home.

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they reunite
at the end of the film,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
just like Odysseus
reunites with his wife.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It is about love.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It's about what
drives Cooper back.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.400 align:middle line:84%
His chief motivation
in what he's doing

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
is his love of Murph.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "A Wrinkle in
Time," a famous kid's book

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that I read when I
was in grade school,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and it was my first introduction
to the idea of the tesseract.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's a similar theme
in "A Wrinkle in Time"

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is that this
salvation has to come

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.965 align:middle line:84%
through some sort of stepping
through the tesseract.

00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:11.923 align:middle line:84%
And so I wonder if
Christopher Nolan isn't even

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
borrowing from that
famous kid's book, which

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
deals with this theme.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.695 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Nolan is
playing with time.

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The big theme in
this movie is time.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And he believes that--

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
you can see that he's
having a hard time

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:90%
dealing with time travel.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So he's not dealing
with time travel.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
He's dealing with time
as a linear concept.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And Cooper has to get to
Murph, because he loves her,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but he's caught, and he gets
caught in the black hole.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's his love of Murph that
actually gets him back to Earth

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.745 align:middle line:90%
to meet her again.

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And there is no segue
in that sequence

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of how he got to Earth.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
He got to Earth because he
was witnessing Murph's life

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
through the splintering
of time in the tesseract,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and that so
overwhelmed him that he

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:84%
was able to come back
to Earth on his own.

When I'm up there in
hypersleep or traveling

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light
or near a black hole,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
time's going to change
for me, and it's

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.572 align:middle line:90%
going to run more slowly.

00:13:28.572 --> 00:13:34.028 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we get back,
we're going to compare.

00:13:34.028 --> 00:13:35.966 align:middle line:10%
- Time will run
differently for us?

00:13:35.966 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:10%
I mean, by the time I
get back, we might even

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:10%
be the same age, you and me.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:90%

>>DYER: Tell me why you chose
that clip, because I didn't--

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.109 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I thought about time
being related to this film

00:13:54.109 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and obviously the
overcoming of time.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But that watch and the
sequences that he sends back

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.049 align:middle line:84%
in that binary code, it
relates directly to this watch.

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:90%
What do you make of that?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.506 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well,
I think the watch

00:14:05.506 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit like the
spinning top in "Inception."

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think it's a device
that allows the film to go on.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the MacGuffin, as Hitchcock
would call it, the thing that

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
keeps it going.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it's how they
communicate with each other

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:90%
so that the world is saved.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Murph
eventually grows up.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:10%
She becomes the scientist
that saves the world

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:10%
from the problems
that it has because

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:10%
of her relationship with
Cooper and because Cooper

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:10%
has found a way to successfully
communicate with her backwards

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:10%
into time.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.966 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: In so many
of these films,

00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the themes
that we've seen,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
which goes back again to ancient
mythology and Greek mythology,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
is the loss of the male,
the loss of the hero.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Darth Vader has gone
to the dark side.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and Luke doesn't have a father.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Odysseus goes off
on his journey.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Bowman goes off on his
journey into the stargate.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
missing figure,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
right, the lack of the king
in "The Lord of the Rings."

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, return of the king, right?

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
happening with Cooper.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Cooper eventually
does come back.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Because, again, it's love.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It's interconnection with
familial relationships

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that I think are the real
strength of humanity.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And the real
hero of this movie is Murph.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And she
doesn't have a mother.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Interesting.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And she loses her
father, or her [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, right.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.225 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: All right?

00:15:24.225 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
But she becomes the
person who saves the Earth

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:90%
from the disaster.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have to
resort to alternative three,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, it's
still happening in the movie.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They're still conquering other
worlds and sending people out,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:90%
but the Earth has been saved.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.912 align:middle line:84%
So both are happening in
the end of this movie.

00:15:41.912 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has been
saved, but we're still

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:90%
conquering other planets.

>>WEIDNER: There's a certain
poem by Dylan Thomas which

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
permeates this film, and it's
one of my very favorite poems.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's watch this scene,
because the poetry really

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.365 align:middle line:90%
shines through.

he has Michael Caine

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
saying the poem when it
was Michael Caine earlier

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
in the film who said that
we had to leave the Earth

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and not rage against
the dying of the light.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is happening
is that Murph and Cooper see

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
dying, and they

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
unite to rage against
the dying of the light.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.148 align:middle line:84%

Earth because of their raging

requires the aid of AI, right?

00:17:13.034 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
So AI is not just a threat.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
I think Nolan is really
trying to tell us,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
as you pointed out, that
the TARS characters,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
they very much resemble
the monolith in "2001."

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And we know from the
original script of "2001"

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that the monolith was intended
to kind of be a television

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:90%
screen, video screen/AI.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the unknown, the
great beyond in terms

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of intelligent
being, presumably

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
something that's a
future advanced computer.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The same idea is at work
here, but Nolan is again

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
saying it doesn't have
to be a negative thing.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It can be our--

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:90%
it can be a positive thing.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It can help us to go to
the next level basically.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
few films where AI is

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:90%
shown to be a positive force.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
this AI, while it's friendly,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
you get the idea that it's more
like, I think, AI really is.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not this
conspiratorial type of thing

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
that keeps being presented by
Cameron and Kubrick in things.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe AI is just a helpful
thing to help us think.

going on in this film.

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
amazing about this film

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is that Nolan is
actually using cinema

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%

hyperdimensional states.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a sphere.

- Well, of course it is.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.962 align:middle line:84%
What, you thought it
would just be a hole?

00:18:54.962 --> 00:18:56.785 align:middle line:84%
- No, it's just that
all the illustrations

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen, they--

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
- Illustrations?

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you how it works.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So they say you want to
go from here to there,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.262 align:middle line:90%
but it's too far.

00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:90%
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
- So a wormhole
bends space like this

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
so you can take a shortcut
through a higher dimension.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so to show that, they've
turned three-dimensional space

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
into two dimensions,
which turns a wormhole

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:90%
into two dimensions, a circle.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.405 align:middle line:84%
And what's a circle
in three dimensions?

00:19:29.405 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:90%
- A sphere.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:90%
- Exactly.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:10%
A spherical hole.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:10%

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
where he explains the
idea of a tesseract.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And although we don't
know what that's like,

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.312 align:middle line:84%
it's an actual real
geometrical form.

00:20:07.312 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is really
fascinating, and some

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of the top physicists
like Lisa Randall

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
have actually written
books on this.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And what she does
is she explains

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
the mathematics of the
next dimension [? up, ?]

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:10%
believe it or not,
through crystals.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.450 align:middle line:84%
There are many
crystals that actually

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have the geometrical pattern
and structure of what we believe

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:90%
the next dimension to be.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not making this up.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:90%
There are quasicrystals, right?

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.266 align:middle line:84%
This is what's sprayed
on nonstick pans.

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Lisa Randall has a
famous essay on this

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:84%
where she talks about the fact
that the reason that nonstick

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
pans work, the reason
that they're slippery,

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is because they have this
geometrical structure

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
in their crystal.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is the same geometrical
structure of whatever

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.982 align:middle line:90%
the next dimension is.

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it's
pictured in the film.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Nolan tries to picture
it in that weird sort

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
of infinite library
scene, right?

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually what we
believe the next dimension is.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:58.925 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.425 align:middle line:84%
And what's so great
about that scene

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is that Nolan is
dividing time into space.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So every time that--

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
every time that Cooper
looks through one

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of the windows in
the tesseract, he's

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.492 align:middle line:84%
seeing another moment in
Murph's life in her bedroom.

00:21:14.492 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the subplots
of the movie is

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that Murph is being haunted
by a ghost in her bedroom.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's cut to this
scene and show you

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that, and then we'll talk
about what this really means.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.316 align:middle line:90%
- I told you about my ghost.

00:21:23.316 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:84%
My dad thought I called it a
ghost because I'm scared of it.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.619 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:36.924 align:middle line:90%
But I was never scared of it.

00:21:36.924 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I called it a ghost
because it felt--

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.318 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
it felt like a person that was
trying to tell me something.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
If there's an answer
here on Earth,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
it's back there
somehow in that room.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
So I have to find it.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: What I find
interesting about this

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is another aspect
to which Nolan is

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
challenging our traditional
conceptions of aliens

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:90%
and ghosts.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.231 align:middle line:84%
So if you remember earlier in
the film, we didn't look at it,

00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
but there's a scene where Cooper
and the Anne Hathaway character

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:90%
are--

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.845 align:middle line:84%
right before they're
going to the stargate

00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
they see this kind
of hand reach out

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
of some higher
dimension towards them.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Later in the film, we're dealing
with this issue of the ghost

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.171 align:middle line:84%
that Murph perceived to
be in her room all along.

00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the idea of
the aliens and the ghosts.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And what Nolan is presenting
is this interesting idea

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
of maybe all of that
paranormal phenomenon

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and so forth could
actually just be

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
advanced humans in the
future stepping back in time.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I think about that,

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's an interesting thesis.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anybody
come up with that idea.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Actually, I have
heard that idea, that UFOs

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and aliens and
things are actually

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:84%
humans from the future
coming back doing something.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But it is a very
interesting idea.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in this scene,
we see that she--

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:90%
this is Murph later, older.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's having
flashbacks to her childhood

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
as they're leaving the
house for the last time

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
because the Earth is dying.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to go
back in one last time

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to see this bedroom
where she had

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:90%
the interaction with the ghost.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that becomes
the climax of the movie

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
as she begins to realize that
the ghost is not a ghost.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's actually Cooper who is
in another dimension trying

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to her, and
we have the delicious scene

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:90%
with the watch.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.270 align:middle line:84%
There's another important
philosophical aspect

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.728 align:middle line:84%
to the film that
I want to mention,

00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reference to the
works of Douglas Hofstadter.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
He's written two famous
books, one of which

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.115 align:middle line:84%
was a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book called "Godel, Escher,

00:23:44.115 --> 00:23:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and Bach," and
there he's dealing

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
with the famous
logician Kurt Godel.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And Godel had this famous
theory refuting Bertrand Russell

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that the way that we would prove
mathematical entities as real

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is to show that as long as you
believe in one sequence or set

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of numbers, they're always
going to be self-referencing.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying
that you can never

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
get outside of that set without
appealing to that set, which

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
proves that there's some other
layer or level of reality,

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
which Hofstadter
titles strange loops.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what
Hofstadter does is he

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
looks at the musical
compositions of Bach.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:84%
He looks at the
artwork of MC Escher.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
you can see patterns

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that show the limitations
of our dimension.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a very famous book.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
This is not
speculation or weird.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
prominent guy who's

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
saying that there are
higher dimensions,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and we can know
this mathematically.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
mathematicians

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:90%
that have shown this.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
The implications are tremendous.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I mention
that is because there's

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
a brief scene inside
Murph's lecture

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
hall or her room,
office, or whatever,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:84%
where you actually see the works
of Douglas Hofstadter sitting

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:90%
on the shelf.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.415 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: And in "Inception,"
they do the MC Escher stairs.

00:24:56.415 --> 00:24:57.215 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:24:57.215 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: They have the
chase scene on the stairs.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:10%
So Nolan is clearly
aware of all this stuff

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:10%
and is referencing
it left and right.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And what is the
bridge is; we are the bridge.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Our psyche, our
love, it's humanity.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And our minds that
are the bridge,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not something out there.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
It requires the psyche.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when he
goes in to the stargate

00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and into the tesseract, it's all
a manifestation of his psyche.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:84%
That's how he talks
to his daughter.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And don't
forget, love is attraction.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.322 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And love is gravity.

00:25:29.322 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:84%
When two people are
in love, whether it's

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
a daughter and father or a
man and woman or whoever,

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:90%
they're feeling--

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
you can literally feel the
gravity between the two

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:90%
increasing.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
He's drawing the analogy
that gravity and love

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.502 align:middle line:90%
are very closely related.

00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:44.301 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
When he goes into the stargate
or into the tesseract,

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:90%
it's his psyche.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is just what we
saw in "Inception," right?

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The Nolan film "Inception"
has the exact same theme.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all dealing with the inner
world of Cobb's subconscious

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
and his projections, right?

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the exterior
world going out

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:90%
there to the farthest reaches.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, when
he goes to the tesseract,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.627 align:middle line:90%
it's back inside.

00:26:07.627 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly right.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the difference
between the two movies.

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
One is inside trying to get out.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The other is out
trying to get in.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.315 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And we're going to
see that with this clip,

00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that all of this is one little
girl's bedroom and one moment.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.345 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

- It's not a ghost.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.232 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
It's gravity.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:90%
- But you're going to get TARS.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I brought myself here.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We're here to communicate with
the three-dimensional world.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:90%
We're the bridge.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I thought they chose me.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.585 align:middle line:90%
They didn't choose me.

00:26:50.585 --> 00:26:51.525 align:middle line:90%
They chose her.

00:26:51.525 --> 00:26:52.706 align:middle line:90%
- For what, Cooper?

00:26:52.706 --> 00:26:55.562 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.562 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:90%
- To save the world.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
All of this is one
little girl's bedroom.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Every moment is
infinitely complex.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
They have access to
infinite time and space,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.505 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
bound by anything.

00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:84%
If they can find a
specific place in time,

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.162 align:middle line:90%
they can communicate.

00:27:19.162 --> 00:27:20.476 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm here.

00:27:20.476 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find a
way to tell Murph,

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
just like I found this moment.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.875 align:middle line:90%
- How, Cooper?

00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:26.377 align:middle line:90%
- Love, TARS, love.

00:27:26.377 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:90%
This is [INAUDIBLE] go inside.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
My connection with Murph,
it is quantifiable.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the key.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:90%
- What are we here to do?

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.516 align:middle line:90%
- Find how to tell her.

00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:38.468 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.468 --> 00:27:39.452 align:middle line:90%
The watch.

00:27:39.452 --> 00:27:42.896 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.896 --> 00:27:45.356 align:middle line:90%
The watch.

00:27:45.356 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.184 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So what
he finds out here

00:27:50.184 --> 00:27:53.745 align:middle line:84%
is that the future
advanced humans do

00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
transcend time and space,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
but they need a medium
still to communicate.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So what Cooper has to do is
to find that medium, which

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.985 align:middle line:84%
is a specific moment in time
to which he can translate

00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
through this binary
code, but it's not

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:84%
going to work unless
there's love there.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing about that
is that initially in the film

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.330 align:middle line:84%
gravity is the enemy
that has to be overcome.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Gravity's going
to kill humanity.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Here gravity is
transformed into the force

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
of love, which, believe or
not, that echoes Aristotle.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.576 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle said that there
is some universal force.

00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It causes all the planets
and the celestial spheres

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.692 align:middle line:90%
to spin and go around.

00:28:24.692 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And what is that force?

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.454 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:28:26.454 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly
what this movie is saying.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's how Murph
transcends being

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:84%
caught in the black
hole, which surely

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:90%
would have ripped him apart.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I like about
this tesseract scene the most

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:90%
is that Nolan eschews using CGI.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:84%
He's literally building the set,
probably on a huge soundstage

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, and using a real
camera to glide in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And a real tesseract
that they [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.123 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: And a real tesseract.

00:28:49.123 --> 00:28:51.215 align:middle line:90%
It is a real tesseract.

00:28:51.215 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And he does this
throughout the film.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
He uses physical effects,
and he gives the film

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
this kind of rough quality that
CGI films really don't have.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's a good point.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I'm
with Nolan on that.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The god of this movie is
a future advanced humanity

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:90%
united with AI.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same idea
that we see in "2001,"

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
again with a positive spin
instead of the negative spin.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.955 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating that we
have the crossing of the abyss.

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:20.330 align:middle line:84%
This is something that comes
out of the esoteric hermetic

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.514 align:middle line:90%
traditions, the idea that--

00:29:21.514 --> 00:29:23.430 align:middle line:84%
what we've seen in "Lord
of the Rings," right?

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Gandalf had to cross
the abyss, defeat the Balrog,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and then he moves on to a
higher state of existence.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
to Cooper, right?

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Cooper has to-- he's the
lone man, the bow man

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
shot out, as you pointed out,
to overcome the abyss of death.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's ultimately,
again, love that does that.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
point of this movie?

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just to
use technology wisely

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and that we can't divorce
it from the ultimate aspect

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:90%
of humanity, which is love.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Another
thing to be pointed out

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:10%
is that tree of
life in the Kabbalah

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:10%
is a little bit like a tesseract
in the way it's constructed.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And there is an abyss
in the tree of life.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It's called Da'at.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're moving
from Tif'eret to Keter,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.475 align:middle line:90%
you have to cross the abyss.

00:30:08.475 --> 00:30:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Keter is the ultimate
way where you commune

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:90%
with the mind of the Creator.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But you can't commune with
the mind of the Creator

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.012 align:middle line:84%
until you've gone
through this abyss.

00:30:19.012 --> 00:30:19.811 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Kubrick's
telling us this.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:84%
"Lord of the Rings"
is telling us this.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.597 align:middle line:90%
And Nolan's telling us this.

00:30:25.597 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So what I
like about this film

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is that, again, we're given a
positive appraisal about what

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:90%
we can do with technology.

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be negative.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be
dissuaded from implementing

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
a space program or any
of this kind of stuff.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as
we do it wisely,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:84%
it can lead us into
terraforming other worlds.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, the chief
message of the film

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
is that if we can maintain
interpersonal relations

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
without losing them at the
expense of gaining tech

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
dominance, then
we're going to go--

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
we're going to go to the stars.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: My takeaway is
that the love between Cooper

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and Murph actually end
up saving the world.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:90%
So love conquers all.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So again, I think we
have to look back to Aristotle.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Because although there's
a lot of good in Plato,

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.720 align:middle line:84%
there's also good
correctives that

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
come from Aristotle that
rebuke some of the errors,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:90%
I believe, in Plato.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Aristotle said

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
was that there is some
sort of unifying force

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.010 align:middle line:90%
that's out there.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
He believed that it was a
god and that it was some kind

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of mind, a universal mind.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.869 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't just say
it was a universal mind.

00:31:32.869 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle literally
said it was love.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He said that love is
the ultimate force,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate unity and
attraction that doesn't just

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:90%
move the planets.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It also moves human virtue,
human emotion, and human will.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And love's that one thing that
really you can't quantify.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: You can't explain
why you love your child

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.166 align:middle line:84%
or why you love your
wife or whatever.

00:31:53.166 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't explain it.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.331 align:middle line:90%
You can't explain why you love.

00:31:55.331 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:90%
You don't know why.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's a completely
mysterious force.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, I believe that
there is this ether around us.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I believe
that love is a gravity.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It is a very serious gravity.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in a
loving relationship,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.374 align:middle line:90%
that gravity is very comforting.

00:32:12.374 --> 00:32:14.581 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think it's a real
experience of the divine.
