Well, Nick is an old
friend of his from college.

And Nick's, you know,
kind of a loser,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a doctor,
now he's a jazz musician.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to point out that
in alchemy, the bird that sings

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:90%
at night is the nightingale.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And Nick Nightingale
is definitely

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:84%
going to sing at night when
he's pursued by the bad guys.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:10%
>> And so he's the one that
reveals that he's the guy that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:10%
told Tom about the party.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I believe
was done by design,

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
these clues are being
left there, you know,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
where he leaves the napkin
that says "fidelio."

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
This was at the behest
of the cult, ultimately.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they were testing
to see if Tom had the stuff.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Now Nicole already
had the stuff.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.562 align:middle line:84%
But does her husband, who's
5 inches shorter than her,

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:90%
does he have the stuff?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, so here we have a
guy who thinks he's at the top

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:90%
of the totem pole, Bill Harford.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
He's an elite New York doctor.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
He's upper, upper middle class,
maybe even lower upper class.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And for him, this is the
apex of his existence.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
He's married to a beautiful
woman who's an artist.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But what Bill's
going to discover

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is that his whole world is
not what he thinks it is.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is a common
theme in surrealism.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that I chose
that clip was because you'll

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.325 align:middle line:84%
notice in the
background-- and you

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
know this-- that Kubrick
was a stickler for symbology

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and background images.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And you see these stars
placed very prominently.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And they appear to be
eight-sided stars, stars

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:90%
of Ishtar.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
looking at something

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
that is immediately occultic.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
There's something
in the background,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and this party is
actually going to be

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the weeding-out process
for what R. Kelly calls

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:90%
the (SINGING) afterparty.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And this after party is going
to be a party like none other,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be a
kind of test or temptation

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that takes place, or
process of weeding out,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
to see if Bill and
Alice are actually

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
worthy of this party,
which we find out

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is actually going to
be a sex magic cult.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So Bill is going to be tempted
by two women, both of whom

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
are British and talk
in terms of nobility.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned being a Windsor,
one of them, Nuala Windsor.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And then Alice is going to be
tempted by this Hungarian suave

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
guy who starts quoting Ovid
about cheating on your spouse.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And his name, curiously,
is Sandor Szavost,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
kind of close to Anton
Szandor LaVey, maybe.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and those
eight-pointed stars,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:10%
when Sandor is dancing with
Nicole Kidman and trying

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:10%
to seduce her by suggesting they
go up and see the more private

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:10%
art collection upstairs--

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm married.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:10%
>> --Kubrick has those
eight-pointed stars constantly

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:10%
behind them.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting is as
he goes through his seduction,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:10%
at the very end when
he fails to seduce her,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:10%
at least temporarily,
I think, she never

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:10%
is ever in alignment
with those eight stars.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:90%
She's always just off alignment.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But when she finally puts
her left hand forward, says,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm married, and
shows him the ring,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
then immediately the stars
form perfect around her head,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as if she's done something
which exalts her.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
point out, of course,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
also that in the after party,
the orgy that we'll see later,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
there's only 11
women in the circle.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:10%
There should be 12 if
it's a proper coven,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:10%
with the 13th in the center.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:10%
So there is a woman missing.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:10%
And I can't help but believe,
as we go through our examination

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:10%
here, that we're both not
going to agree at the end

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.574 align:middle line:10%
that maybe, possibly Alice
actually attended this party.

00:05:14.574 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I've thought.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.031 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I put in the
book, is that my theory is

00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that Alice is or possibly has
been brought up in this cult.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:90%
This is part of her reality.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And she will actually leave
clues throughout the film

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that she knows what Bill's
up to and what's going on.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
process of the film

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is Bill being led towards
this big revelation.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see as we go on
here that Alice is a lot more

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:90%
guilty than we think.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, so the next clip
we're going to look at is under

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:10%
Two important things in
this sequence, first of all,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:10%
the under the rainbow
is very curious

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:10%
because this evokes
"Wizard of Oz."

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>> What is it?

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Just like with
"Alice in Wonderland,"

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Nicole's name is
Alice in this film.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:10%
Here we have under the rainbow.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:10%
This is conscious, I would
say, mind-control imagery.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:10%
And if you doubt that,
consider the fact

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:10%
that this is about human
trafficking in this scene.

This is my daughter.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:07.843 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't do this to me.

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:10%
Let us out of here.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:10%
>> I am afraid that's
out of the question.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.692 align:middle line:10%
Doctor, um, sorry.

00:07:13.692 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:10%
What color did you say?

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh--

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Black?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Black.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.064 align:middle line:10%
>> Gentlemen, please, have
the goodness to be quiet

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:21.246 align:middle line:10%
for the moment.

00:07:21.246 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:10%
Couldn't you see I'm trying
to serve my customer.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.942 align:middle line:10%
Sorry.

00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:10%
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.644 align:middle line:10%
I'll deal with you as soon
as I serve this gentleman.

00:07:31.644 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:10%
>> You need an ermine cloak.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.577 align:middle line:10%
>> And unless you
turn on the captions,

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:10%
or you read the screenplay,
you don't know that what she

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:10%
whispers is "you need
an ermine cloak."

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
An ermine cloak is what the
nobility in Europe have worn.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So she's telling him,
you're going to this party.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
We all know what's
happening here.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
the right cloak.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So that shows that this has all
been a setup to get him there.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.065 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole scene is a
very strange setup for Tom,

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:84%
the Cruise character,
to get to the party,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
real action starts.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we want to look at
next is the idea of secrecy

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.297 align:middle line:90%
within cults.

00:08:10.297 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we think about
"Mulholland Drive," we

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
had at the end-- there
was this hush, right.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The sign of Harpocrates,
it's called.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the ancient
hermetic tradition

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.674 align:middle line:84%
that you can't reveal
the secrets of the cult.

00:08:20.674 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's going on here,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is that we've seen a
series of tests for Bill.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Bill is now going to have to
display some sign of secrecy,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.377 align:middle line:84%
because he's already
seen too much.

00:08:32.377 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the mask
and the oath of secrecy.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe in certain Masonic
groups, in Crowley's group,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:84%
this is a sign of
secrecy that you take,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the hand over the breast.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's the idea
that you're not going

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:10%
to reveal what you've seen.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.244 align:middle line:10%
You've seen too much.

00:08:55.244 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:10%
What's really traumatizing
for this scene

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:10%
is that Bill is now considering
that maybe Alice knows it all.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:90%
She knows that he's been there.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:10%
Why else does he
have this, you know,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.585 align:middle line:10%
Renaissance mask that he's got?

00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:10%
So he's been doing something
that she doesn't know about.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:10%
When she explains her dream,
which has this Eden imagery,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:10%
she mentions it's like Eden.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:10%
She was nude.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And then it turns into
this orgy where she

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:10%
has slept with all these men.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.901 align:middle line:10%
It freaks him out.

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:49.895 align:middle line:10%
[SOBBING]

00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
She's almost playing this
kind of psyops mind game

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.639 align:middle line:84%
with him to basically
break him down.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the cult has
been doing the whole film,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is leading him along, leaving
breadcrumbs, breaking him down,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and ensuring ultimately that
he's going to be obedient.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Kubrick leaves it up
to the viewer to decide.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Did Nicole put that mask
there, or did someone

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
break into their apartment
and leave the mask there?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it's terrifying,
because either it

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
means your wife's
involved, or it

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.886 align:middle line:84%
means that you're
being watched so

00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:84%
heavily that if
you say anything,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:90%
they're going to kill you.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.936 align:middle line:10%
The other thing
that's interesting

00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:10%
is we don't really understand
what happened to the mask

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:10%
at the orgy.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:10%
He takes it off, and
it seems to disappear.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:10%
At that point, we
don't quite understand

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:10%
if they took it from him,
or he lost it, or what.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:10%
But he does lose the mask.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:10%
So we don't know
what happened there.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's another one of those
odd bits of continuity.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> They could have broken
in and left it there.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> They could have.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.331 align:middle line:84%
There are continuity problems
with this movie that I've never

00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:53.934 align:middle line:90%
seen in any Kubrick film.

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The city doesn't make sense,
in terms of its geography.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.683 align:middle line:90%
>> The city does not make sense.

00:10:57.683 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:10%
It does not look like New York.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.242 align:middle line:10%
So everything in this
movie is like a--

00:11:01.242 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It's almost a dream state.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:10%
>> --a dream state.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a dream.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's very novel.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.728 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, there are these strange
continuity errors that are

00:11:06.728 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:10%
running all through the film,
which Kubrick was more or less

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.362 align:middle line:10%
known to be a continuity freak.

00:11:12.362 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he would
never allow that.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> No, he would take Polaroid
pictures to make sure

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:90%
everything was exactly the same.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Somebody may have
budged something

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
when they went to
lunch or something.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:10%
Or he would purposely screw
with your continuity and reverse

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:10%
things, like he was consciously
doing in The Shining, where you

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.329 align:middle line:10%
were looking down a hallway.

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And then the next cut, you're
looking the opposite way,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:10%
but everybody is still
in the same direction,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:10%
which was very odd.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.260 align:middle line:90%
So he's doing these.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But these continuity errors
don't make a lot of sense.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There are conscious
alterations that make us

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.177 align:middle line:90%
wonder, is this a wake state?

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it a dream state?

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, which is
fitting because this is

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:90%
another film about initiation.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about Bill
Harford being brought

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
through this process of seeing
how the world really works.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And he ultimately fails.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
He does not get into the
secret society, which

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:84%
is what the ending is all
about, with them at the Macy's

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:90%
department store.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really Nicole
kind of consoling him.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, you didn't make it.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Big deal, we'll try
again some other time.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And also we need to address the
entire sequences pre-orgy where

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Tom is going through
one female character

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
after another who's
trying to seduce him,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:90%
always failing in some way.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
because as soon as Nicole

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
brings up the fact that
she has this fantasy

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
about this naval
officer, suddenly

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Tom's world, Bill Harford's
world, is shattered,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%
completely shattered.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And he goes out seeking,
like she was seeking, sex.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.815 align:middle line:90%
But he never, ever achieves it.

00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And I thought
if he wanted me,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:10%
even if it was
only for one night,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:10%
I was ready to
give up everything.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill Harford is confronted
with a level of wealth

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.921 align:middle line:84%
and power that he
couldn't even conceive of.

00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this cult has.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
This cult also has
at its disposal

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:84%
all of the apparatchiks
of an intelligence agency.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
able to surveil him.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They can control what's in the
news, the story that comes out

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
about the beauty queen who
ransoms herself, right?

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:90%
So they're very powerful.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
the takeaway here

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
is that Bill Harford is not
at the top of the totem pole.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:90%
There are people above him.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways I think that
we know that Alice is involved

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is when Bill comes home
from his experience,

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and she is sitting there
teaching the daughter

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:90%
about mathematics.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And she says, two plus
two, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has
$4, it equals $5.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
This guy has a lot
more money than you.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.502 align:middle line:84%
And she looks over
at Bill, saying,

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
he's got a lot more
money than you.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
you're dealing

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
with people who are
billionaires, trillionaires.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
They've got a lot
more money than you.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.224 align:middle line:90%
You're out of your league.

00:14:22.224 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
You're out of your
element, Donny.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You're just a doctor.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, so in
the next scene,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.102 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see this promise
being made that is after all

00:14:31.102 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:90%
of the traumatic experiences.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of this has
gone down, and they're

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to cope with
and really figure out

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
how to handle what they've seen
and what they've agreed to.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So Bill is struggling
with the moral quandary

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
of cheating on his
wife, which he's not

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.770 align:middle line:84%
successful in doing throughout
the beginning of the film.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes in contact
with this sex magic cult

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
that has no taboos whatsoever.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.764 align:middle line:84%
They're willing to engage
in murder, orgies, whatever.

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
throughout the film,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
we've seen a lot of
symbology related to masks.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:84%
If you noticed at Domino, the
hooker who tries to seduce him,

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
she has all these
masks on her wall.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And she's got books on
Freud and sociology,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
curious for a hooker.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing that Domino was
one of the girls at the orgy

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
as well who was leading
Bill down this path,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
because when he goes
back, Domino is gone.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:90%
She's disappeared.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So she's played her role,
as she was supposed to.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.422 align:middle line:90%
So the promise has been made.

00:15:27.422 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to look at this scene

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
where he's caught in the
midst of the occult ritual.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And it is an occult ritual.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they use a specifically
Romanian orthodox chant

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:90%
put in reverse.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Catholic mass.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and it's
intentionally reversed,

00:15:45.797 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
which is that principle
of inversion, black magic,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So we know that it is a sex
ritual cult. It's a dark cult.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:10%
Next we want to see that
clip where Bill gets caught.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:10%
>> What-- what is gonna
happen to that woman?

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>> No one can
change her fate now.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:10%
When a promise has been made
here, there is no turning back.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:10%
Go.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.046 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting that the
hierophant of this cult has

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:90%
a British accent.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
the ermine cloak

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
was mentioned by Leelee
Sobieski's character

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
because that's
European nobility.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if,
because Kubrick was

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the British
upper establishment, the Royal

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Society and so forth,
if he wasn't kind

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
of transmitting the idea that
maybe this power-playing cult

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.362 align:middle line:84%
level of people
is at that level.

00:16:43.362 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> That's interesting
you say that,

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because the actor who voiced
that character would play Lord

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Bullington in "Barry Lyndon,"
the upper-crust family.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Barry Lyndon,
played by Ryan O'Neal,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
is trying to kind of break
through and get into.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And he destroys Barry
Lyndon in the movie.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I think Kubrick
consciously did that,

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
chose a very upper-crust
accent which the actor has,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:90%
and a very interesting scene.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Kubrick has no problem
showing that the establishment

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
is willing to
traffick in humans.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this happens
in "Barry Lyndon."

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You have this notion
of illicit sexuality

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.462 align:middle line:90%
with underage people, minors.

00:17:23.462 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what's happening with
the Leelee Sobieski character

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:90%
referenced here in this film.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:90%
"Lolita," right?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.823 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Kubrick doesn't have
a problem talking about it.

00:17:30.823 --> 00:17:32.979 align:middle line:84%
And we even get that maybe
Danny in "The Shining"

00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%
might have been molested.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the whole scene
with him on the bed with Jack

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Nicholson, where he's saying, I
promise I will never hurt you,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Danny.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
creepiest scene.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Kubrick saying
too much with this?

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he is.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I think
he's pointing out here

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that this group is
not only all powerful.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But, again, what
happened to the mask?

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.870 align:middle line:90%
He loses his mask.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
When he returns the
costume later to Milich,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't have the mask.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But he should have
the mask in his hand

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
because he took it off.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it should be right
there in his hand,

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:90%
so it's very mysterious.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe taking the mask
was part of the ritual

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and then used to
scare him later.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
the manipulation going

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
on in this film and how
Tom is like a football

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
in a giant game, then I think
the mystery kind of evaporates.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:26.221 align:middle line:84%
>> What we saw at the estate was
this magic circle, so to speak.

00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to look at next

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.505 align:middle line:84%
is how it comes
up back at the end

00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of the film towards
the close, where

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
they're walking around the
department store at Christmas.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And consciously, Kubrick shows
this game, The Magic Circle.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see
pentagrams everywhere.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at that.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:10%
So now he's come in contact
with the magic circle.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.002 align:middle line:10%
I think we both probably
agree that Alice

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:10%
is part of this circle.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:10%
She's part of this coven, right?

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.252 align:middle line:10%
So now they've got
to deal with this.

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:10%
How are they going
to deal with it?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:10%
>> That's nice.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.042 align:middle line:10%
>> I could put Sabrina in here.

00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:08.994 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:19:08.994 --> 00:19:11.436 align:middle line:10%
>> It's really pretty.

00:19:11.436 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:10%
>> It's old-fashioned.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.774 align:middle line:84%
>> I think overall, it's
interesting in this film that

00:19:16.774 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
everything is taking
place at Christmas.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:10%
This is a religious holiday.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.989 align:middle line:10%
But we almost get the
impression from the cult side

00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:10%
that it's the
inversion of Christmas.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Just like they reversed
the musical mass chant,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:10%
Christmas itself
has been inverted

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:10%
as a kind of dark version
of Christmas almost.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.628 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.628 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Alice, what do you
think we should do?

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:54.554 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:56.490 align:middle line:10%
>> What do I think we should do?

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Look, Mommy.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.496 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.496 --> 00:20:01.458 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey.

00:20:01.458 --> 00:20:05.787 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:06.749 align:middle line:10%
[SIGH]

00:20:06.749 --> 00:20:07.711 align:middle line:10%
What do I think?

00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:10%
I-- I don't know.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So many big events happen
on occult calendar days,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.375 align:middle line:84%
or on Lammas, or Walpurgisnacht
or something like that.

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> They do, and Kubrick
is totally aware of this.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I pointed out to
you that Kubrick

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
died on March 9,
1999, which is exactly

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
666 days from January 1, 2001,
which is the year of his most

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
famous movie.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And so even his death has these
weird occult aspects to it.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have to wonder if
that wasn't an accident,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:90%
either, you know.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is there a connection
between a monolith in the film

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
"2001" and in 2001, two
giant monoliths fall on 9/11.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, one of the buildings
in the World Trade Center was

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
called the Millennium hotel,
and it was christened in 2001,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:90%
the year of the--

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was shaped just
like the black monolith.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and the reason we
would say that in reference

00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
to "Eyes Wide Shut" is that
this is a film about ritual.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It's about a occult
ritual, dates, calendars.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so in this worldview,
in this perspective,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:84%
you can see how he would perhaps
view these kinds of big ritual

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
actions in that way, twilight
language, so to speak.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and we now-- a
few years ago it came out--

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.010 align:middle line:84%
pictures from a
Rothschild party.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 1972 Rothschild ball, right?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> 1927, which was exactly
the same kind of masks

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and everything, and I would
point out that the orgy takes

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:84%
place in a house owned by
the Rothschilds in real life.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are all
these allusions that

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:84%
are going on between
the occult and reality.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I would point out
something important here.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
My first essay on "2001"
being an occult film

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
came out in April of 1999.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was chastised by
many Kubrick people,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
saying that Kubrick wasn't
interested in the occult.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It was a science fiction film.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:90%
You've taken this way too far.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
on July 20, 1999,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
exactly 30 years
after the landing

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Apollo moon Lander for
Apollo 11, "Eyes Wide Shut"

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
came out, at Kubrick's
insistence by the way.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had
to change their mind

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
because here it
was clear that he

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:90%
was talking about the occult.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
There's one other
aspect of this film

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to touch on
before we go here,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and that hasn't been
seen very much before.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of a personal
story from Stanley.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't realize,
but years before this movie

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
was made and his death,
his daughter, Vivian,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
had left the family and
moved to Los Angeles

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to join Scientology cult.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and Kubrick
was very upset by this,

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
especially when Vivian
did not come home for her

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.957 align:middle line:84%
sister's funeral,
which was shocking.

00:22:56.957 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And she did not come home for
Stanley's funeral, either,

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:90%
I might add.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And Kubrick was
very upset by this

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and wrote a 40-page letter
to her, which remains

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
unpublished to this day.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But those who have read it
said it's a heartbreaking,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, literary piece
of him begging his daughter

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to come back, because she
was the light of his life.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My takeaway from this film
is that there are power players

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
that most people can't
see and can't conceive of.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And so because
they can't conceive

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
of there being rich and powerful
cults that engage in sex magic

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
or have this kind of a magical
worldview, ceremonial magic

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot, they don't
believe that that exists.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And then in this story as
well as other stories like it,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
you have the no-nothing
person confronted with this.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It melts their mind
basically, and then they

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to interpret
the world at all after that.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
jarring experience.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Their whole worldview
is shattered.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the name
of the film gives it away.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick is saying
to the audience,

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
this is how the
world really works.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes are wide shut.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I can show it to you, and
you still won't believe it.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
that's a good takeaway.

00:24:09.536 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:84%
My takeaway is a little
bit different, but close.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I think actually some of the
ideas that we've expressed

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
in this show is in reverse.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
What's happening here at
the beginning of the show

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:90%
is Tom is an individual.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Tom is a self-realized doctor.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:90%
He's at the top of his game.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And he uses money to get what
he wants because he thinks

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:90%
that's how the world works.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of the show,
he is no longer self-realized.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:90%
He has just been destroyed.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
His personality
has been flatlined.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Kubrick loves
to do these juicy reversals.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's doing the
exact opposite of the hero's

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
journey in this, and
it's the exact opposite.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:90%
The hero is going to lose.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> The hero fail.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>> The hero fail, exactly.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Join us next time
on "Hollywood Decoded."

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:03.552 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:25:03.552 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
