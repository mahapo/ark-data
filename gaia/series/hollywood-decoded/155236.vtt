>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner,

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.172 align:middle line:84%
and you're watching
"Hollywood Decoded".

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:22.045 align:middle line:90%
MUSIC PLAYING

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Today we're
going to be talking

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:84%
about The Lord of
the Rings Trilogy.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And we chose this
film for many reasons.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a tale
of the perennial forces

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
of good and evil battling
it out over the ages.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It also, I think, operates
on about four or five

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:90%
different levels.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You have, on the one
hand, ancient history that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Tolkien himself said was real.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
On another level, you have
the mythological aspects

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that tie in to a lot of Greek
mythology and ancient Hindu

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:90%
mythology.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
On another level, you have
an alchemical hermetic aspect

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:90%
to this trilogy.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And then lastly, I
think you actually

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
have a kind of
prophetic significance

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to a warning about what's
coming in the future,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and that we will be saved
from the coming disasters.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Jay, what do you think?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.673 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, I
think you're right.

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's quite
obvious that this story's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
about the end of the age,
the end of the third age,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning
of the fourth age.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think Tolkien has
gone back into the Kalevala

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and realizes the Finnish
myths, and realized

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that these were actually
true, that through the study

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
of etymology, of word,
that he was getting

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%
some kind of secret history.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
lot of truth in doing--

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
an historical endeavor
through language, I think,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of great credibility.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by this is
that Tolkien would frequently

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:84%
drive around the
countryside in England

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
on Sundays with his
wife and with CS Lewis.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And he would stop at
an ancient street name

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:90%
in the back country of England.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And he would explain
what the word meant,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
who the people
were that named it,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
what their whole way of life
was like, that they were farmers

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
or they raised
cattle or whatever.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And he could tell it
all from just the name.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And he used this same kind of
technique with the Kalevala.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
He would take a word and
he would go backwards.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a word, any
word in the English language,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:90%
it has a huge history of use.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand
our history,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
history of
English-speaking people,

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:90%
through the study of English.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And he just
did the same thing

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
with the study of the
ancient Finnish texts.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the story
of the age, the third age,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
the third age, all

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of the wild and crazy
beings that populated

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Europe and the Earth at
the time are leaving,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's now having
the age of men.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And Sauron as the
evil lord who's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to stop
the end of the age

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
from occurring because
he knows that means it's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.505 align:middle line:90%
the end of his power.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So I
think in the end,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
this is an amazing
mythology that Tolkien

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
wrote because he had
gone to World War I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
with all of the buddies in
his little town in England.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And they all died
except for Tolkien.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And as he was recovering
from his wounds,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
he kind of vowed
to himself that he

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
would dedicate his
life to finding a way

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:90%
around these kinds of problems.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And when he moved
from South Africa

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to near Manchester, England,
he saw the beginning

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
of the industrial age
as it struck Europe,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and he saw the great
forests being taken down

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
by the industrialists,
and he lamented this.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
He would sit and
cry, his mom said,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
as he watched the
trees being cut down.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So again, you see
that Tolkien thought

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
we're at the end
of our fourth age,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to draw
a reflection about what

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
the end of the third age looks
like so that as we approach

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the end of the fourth age
right now, as he thought,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
it would be easier on us.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think there's
a lot of parallels

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.079 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of religious
mythology that's very crucial.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning
of the film we're

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
going to see a
clip where we have

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
kind of the back story of
the origin of these races.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And Tolkien is literally
telling us about--

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
sort of in a quasi-angelic
race of elves,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
we have humans that are a
kind of royal bloodline,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
the Dunedain, all
of this is going

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to be under the aegis
of a kind of deception

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
that's foisted upon the
races by this evil figure

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Sauron, who, as
we're going to see,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:90%
connects to Satan or to Saturn.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
clip of the introduction.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.526 align:middle line:84%
- For none now live
who remember it.

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:58.726 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It began with the
forging of great rings.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Three were given to the elves,
immortal, wisest, and fairest

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
of all beings; seven
to the dwarf lords,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls;

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and nine, nine rings were
gifted to the race of men,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.186 align:middle line:90%
who above all else desire power.

00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So here we have the
laying out of the temptation.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And really, that is
the essence of what

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:90%
the struggle is of this film.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.501 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
David and Goliath story.

00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be courage in the
face of despair and disaster.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that this ring is, in a way,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
dark sorcery, and it's
connected to technology.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to come up many
times in the clips in the film

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
because with Sauron,
for example, is going

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to explain that it's
the machine of war

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that he's working for
at the behest of Sauron.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
He's the evil wizard who
goes from good to bad.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But what this is
is a temptation.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a temptation
to all the races.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
temptation to seek power

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:90%
for the sake of raw power.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, it keeps the
races and the peoples divided,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and they all fight
amongst each other.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the history
back into "The Hobbit",

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
"The Silmarillion",
the earlier texts

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that are the background
of this story.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
success is going

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to come through
Gandalf essentially

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
being a kind of
geopolitical chess master,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
arranging a great gambit
with salvation occurring

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
through the most humble of
means to little bitty hobbit

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
guys marching into Mordor to
destroy this ring of power

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's a trap.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we should also note
that 19 rings are given out

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:90%
to the citizens of Middle Earth.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But in secret Sauron
creates another ring,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and this ring is the ring
that rules those other rings.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And so Sauron has been able to
use the ring as a controlling

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
device to keep
control and to watch

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's also a
surveillance kind of operation.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Tolkien called the
ring the machine,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that to him, the
industrial age represented

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
this completely destructive
force that was going

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:90%
to destroy all life on Earth.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the ring becomes
that destructive force.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And also it should
be noted that the ring gives you

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
extended life, but it's a fake
extended life, because once you

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
lose the ring you
age rapidly and die.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a good thing.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So the ring offers you
gifts, but at a huge price.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is
essentially the offer

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have from
transhumanism and technology

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
is that its misuse is
kind of a deception,

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.156 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, you're
going to live forever.

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:50.155 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have all
these great advantages.

00:07:50.155 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's a dark
side to it that

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:84%
comes up throughout
the films consistently.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually explained
to be the war machine.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.472 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like he's
seeing the Pentagon,

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the military industrial
complex being built up,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
as a result of World War I that
you talked about, into World

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:90%
War II and the Cold War.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I
see it as a warning.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
will be, I think,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
successful in destroying
the new world order,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and we will return to a more
kind of organic existence.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's literally
what he's saying,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.739 align:middle line:84%
that these ancient
ages and cycles,

00:08:20.739 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:90%
they've already happened.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.404 align:middle line:84%
We've already
experienced these things,

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of stuck in
our collective race memories,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.543 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's exactly right.

00:08:28.543 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
you examine it, he's

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
saying that every end of the
age, evil solidifies its power

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and attempts to
control everyone.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But evil always underestimates
us and our power.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, going
back to Gandalf,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:90%
it's really fascinating.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf is manipulating
everybody in this movie,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:90%
everybody except for Sauron.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And he sends the
hobbits into Mordor

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
believe that Sauron

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to even see them
or even care about them,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and that they have no power.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the
smallest of creatures

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
in Middle Earth is the ones
that actually did destroy--

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
did have the tenacity to go
forward and destroy the ring.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But I will note,
even in the end,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Frodo does not destroy the ring.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.874 align:middle line:84%
It's Gollum's greed which
gets the ring destroyed.

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You know,
Gandalf is interesting

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
because he's this sort
of sage mystic saint who

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
walks amidst the immortal
elves and the humans.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
He meets at the
Council of Elrond,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of the
overwatchers, the overseers

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:90%
of Middle Earth.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And they really plan this
out in a kind of secret way.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that he
has to deceive everyone

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is because he can't
let that get out.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's such a dangerous gambit
that he's sending in the ring

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
into Mordor with this
humble little spy,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that it's too risky
to tell anybody.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's an amazing
picture, also,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
on the geopolitical
level, as well as

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:90%
spiritual and mythological.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But we want to look at Gandalf
as also a kind of alchemical

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
spiritual transformation because
he goes from a grey order

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
wizard, and does his descent,
which is the Greek mythological

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
tradition of the catabasis,
which you see this in Homer,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
you see this in Virgil
in "The Aeneid".

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:84%
The hero has to go through the
descent into the underworld,

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
face the spirits of
death, and then re-emerge

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.736 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we want
to look at this servant

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
of the secret fire and consider
how Gandalf is actually

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
part of the secret
order that keeps

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
these secrets because they're
too dangerous to be let out.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And I think that there is--

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in mythology, there is
this idea that there

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.780 align:middle line:84%
is a secret order which
is kind of watching over

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
us and protecting
us from great evil.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And the hermits, for instance,
were hermetic scholars that

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
lived in medieval times,
but they lived alone

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and they studied hermeticism,
so they were called hermits.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And what the hermits, the
rumors of the hermits were,

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
was that they would
come into a town

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.299 align:middle line:84%
and use their magic to make
the village better, more happy.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So let's look at The
Servant of the Secret Fire

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:90%
clip.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
because it's also

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
going to show us the revelation
of the underworld, which

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is very important in terms
of Hades, the realm of death,

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.237 align:middle line:90%
and the overcoming of death.

00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:21.722 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:22.716 align:middle line:90%
- You cannot pass.

00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:23.516 align:middle line:90%
- Gandalf!

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
- I am a servant
of the secret fire,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.312 align:middle line:90%
wielder of the flame of Anor.

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:38.222 align:middle line:84%
The Dark Flame will not
avail you, Flame of Udun.

00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:48.365 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.365 --> 00:11:49.645 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the shadow.

00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:58.348 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.348 --> 00:12:01.312 align:middle line:90%
You shall not pass.

00:12:01.312 --> 00:12:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So Gandalf is
basically a white magician.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.255 align:middle line:84%
He's a servant of the Secret
Fire, the Flame of Arnor,

00:12:25.255 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:84%
which in Tolkien's mythology
symbolizes the sun.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So he represents the forces
of good, of light, of warmth.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And in every one of the cases of
the characters, what they have

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
to do is face up to some
challenge before they progress

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:90%
to the next level, so to speak.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And in Gandalf's
case, it's actually

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.387 align:middle line:90%
a deeper esoteric level.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
He's actually going
to become a higher

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
level wizard as a result of
this battling with this demon.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing to me
that Tolkien is actually

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
pulling not just from ancient
mythology in Greece and India

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, Nordic
mythology, but this is also

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in Genesis 6.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:84%
You have the story of the fallen
angels that are imprisoned

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:90%
in Hades in the abyss.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The Bridge of Khazad
Dum, in this scene,

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:90%
is spoken of as over the abyss.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It's literally the
bridge between this world

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and the underworld, the next
world, the world of death.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so Gandalf actually
has to die and come back

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:90%
to be at that next level.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes back-- he
tells this very flippantly--

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:90%
that there's nothing to fear.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I love that scene.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
at that clip later

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:84%
because Gandalf really does die
when he falls into the abyss.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he has
trouble remembering his past

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:90%
because he's not the same guy.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I like the scene
where he presents

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
himself to Aragorn the first
time as the light wizard.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.695 align:middle line:90%
And you think it's Sauron.

00:13:42.695 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's perfect
the way they did that.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And so Gandalf is
the chief wizard.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
He is the guy who's ushering
in the next age, which

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:84%
is why he has to leave at
the end of the whole film.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So he leaves and goes off
into the west with the elves.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
This is another important theme
is the lack of leadership.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The humans who are basically
destined to take over the next

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.025 align:middle line:84%
age-- the elves are kind
of handing it over--

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:90%
there's not a leader.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There's no honorable,
virtuous leadership.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And the elves know that
they can't stay any longer.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
handing it over,

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:90%
we need some kind of leadership.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's where both Aragorn
and his royal bloodline

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and the hobbits and
their humility--

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
as I said, a David and
Goliath-type story--

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
come into play to take on
that role of representing

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
virtuous leadership,
which is what

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
humans need in the
face of all the evil

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with
in terms of our day

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
in that prophetic, predictive
programming sense of how

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Tolkien's telling us about the
new world order and all that.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And also
there's all the talk

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:90%
today about bloodlines.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And these bloodlines say that
they have some ancient blood

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
in them, and that's what gives
them the priority for them

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
to rule over us.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that
Tolkien is including

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
this in when this was not
a big rumor in his day,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
in the 40s when he
was writing this.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to see,
that bloodline of Aragorn

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is actually connected to
the tree that represents

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.992 align:middle line:90%
his kingship at the White City.

00:15:15.992 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And that tree is
actually dying, and it's

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
going to take on new life
when the King comes back.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The return of the
King, that's all

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
has a deep alchemical
significance

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.768 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to get into.

00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's important
to consider temptation.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real
message of this ring

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is it's going to be offered to
everybody in different forms.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Here it's, of course, power.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And even the queen of the
elves, even Galadriel herself,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:84%
is tempted to become this dark
goddess because it's almost

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
like the shade side
of your character,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and the Jungian
archetype takes over

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.867 align:middle line:90%
if you give in to this, right?

00:15:48.867 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she
overcomes the temptation.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So throughout the
film we're going

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to see overcoming temptation,
beating those demons or devils.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf even does an exorcism in
this to the King of Rohan, who

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
is under the power of Sauron.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
temptation theme.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
- In the place of a Dark
Lord you would have a Queen!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.608 align:middle line:84%
Not dark but beautiful
and terrible as the morn!

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:20.294 align:middle line:90%
Treacherous as the seas!

00:16:20.294 --> 00:16:25.214 align:middle line:84%
Stronger than the
foundations of the Earth!

00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:27.674 align:middle line:90%
All shall love me and despair.

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:44.402 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I passed the test.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I will diminish Go and go into
the west and remain Galadriel.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You know, in many
hermetic and traditions,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
you have the idea of taking on
a new name and a new identity

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
when you go through
that initiation.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And so for the higher level
controllers and watchers

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%
in this film--

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Gandalf, Galadriel--
their temptation

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:84%
is happening at a way
different, extreme level

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
than what might be happening
to Aragorn or Frodo or Bilbo.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
And so when she
passes this test,

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
she gets to remain herself.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
She's no longer taken over
by this spiritual power.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is a message to us
that just like her or just

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
like Gandalf, just
like Sam and Frodo,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
it's these simple virtues
that actually help us conquer

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
our own personal demons.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I find it interesting
that after she succeeds

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
in not being tempted, she now
realizes that her time is over

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
here, as if she was
waiting to find out

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
what would happen when the ring
was finally presented to her.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Oh, interesting.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And when
she finally did win--

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:84%
succeed from being
tempted by the ring--

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:84%
she now knew her place in this
end of the third age was over

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and it was time
for her to leave.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But she'd succeeded,
by the way, impossibly

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
ascending to a higher
level of being.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's this weird
Madonna-whore complex going on

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
with Galadriel,
where she could turn

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
into this embodiment of the
dark side of the feminine nature

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
or remain a sort
of Marian image.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we first see her at
Lothlorien, the wood elves'

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
kingdom, she's presented in this
very Marian type of imagery.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And so she overcomes it
and remains who she is.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we also
have to mention,

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
temptation, Gollum.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.494 align:middle line:84%
Gollum is one of
the main characters

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
throughout the story,
and you don't expect it.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not expecting him
to be the major player

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:90%
at the climax of the film.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But why do we have
this name Gollum?

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think Tolkien
was very aware

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that that's the medieval Jewish
mystical Kabbalistic name

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
for the creature that is kind
of a slave to the passions.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely mind control,
completely controlled being,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that has almost no free
will because it's enslaved

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.350 align:middle line:90%
to some sort of master.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Gollum represents

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
is the character in the
story who's a tragedy.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't succeed in
overcoming his temptation.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.785 align:middle line:84%
He remains a slave and
he's actually dissociative.

00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, there's
all these scenes

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
where he's split in his
mind, talking to himself.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Precious, right?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:84%
He can't overcome himself,
and so he represents tragedy,

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:90%
which is also a warning for us.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He doesn't
really have a personality.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to develop
one with these arguments

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
between himself, but there's
really nobody home there,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
just like the Gollums
had no one home.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Gollums
almost always had

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to be destroyed
at the end because

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:90%
of their destructive nature.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And he destroys himself
in the end because

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:90%
of, again, his greed.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.997 align:middle line:84%

at next is clip number four.

you're the one to do it?

- And if we fail, what then?

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.025 align:middle line:84%
What happens when Sauron
takes back what is his?

00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:18.378 align:middle line:84%

all about how the ring--

they're all in the

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.588 align:middle line:84%

each other, which

wants, has always wanted.

>>DYER: The only reason that
Frodo and Sam are the ones that

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
can pull this off is
because, if you notice,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.207 align:middle line:84%
they're not interested
in the power.

this ring of power, and if they
get the upper hand, you know,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:90%
they'll dominate.

watching this madness go down.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%

represents that, as I said,
David versus Goliath humility.

00:21:50.794 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
He's the only one
that can do this

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:84%
because he's not going to
be bound by this slavery
