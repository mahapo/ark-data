00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a deeper, more
hidden esoteric meaning behind

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the Hollywood films that
we all have to watch?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.465 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is Hollywood Decoded.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:24.964 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Chinatown is Roman Polanski
trying his hand at neo-noir,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
and what he does is tell a very
seedy tale about corruption

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and degeneracy at the highest
levels of the Los Angeles

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:90%
elite.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.613 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
going to look at today.

00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that Chinatown
really was a great throwback

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
to the '30s, which is a very
interesting time in Hollywood,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
in L.A., and the whole history
of the Water Wars and William

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Mulholland and all of that.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
What Chinatown is really
about, more than anything

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
else, is corruption.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:10%
>> And the name Chinatown
begins with a C, ends with an N,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
and has the same exact number of
letters as the word corruption.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So it is the word they're
slipping in to the movie.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
use the word Chinatown,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:84%
they're talking
about corruption.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, I used to be
with him when we'd

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
patrol the streets of
Chinatown, implying

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that Jack Nicholson
and the cop were once

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
corrupted cops on the street.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's literally no
doubt that Jack Nicholson

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:90%
was probably a corrupted cop.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
ending-- the final

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
takes place in Chinatown where
Faye Dunaway is assassinated

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.295 align:middle line:84%
by the police, that is the
ultimate in corruption.

00:01:38.295 --> 00:01:39.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And her father doesn't
even care about her at all,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
just wants to know if
the daughter is OK.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing about
Chinatown, which I really like,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
is the sparseness of the style.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:10%
Polanski is not getting
in front of the story

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:10%
with his camera, which
a lot of filmmakers

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:10%
will grab a really
good script and then

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:10%
ruin it by having too many
cuts, and kind of crazy camera

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:10%
angles, and all that.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.895 align:middle line:84%
Polanski keeps his
style very, very 1930s,

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
as if he was making a
film in the '30s, where

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:90%
the cameras were 400 pounds.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:10%
It took 15 minutes to
take even a little move.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:10%
They could barely
pan the cameras.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
There's very little activity
going on in the movie.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that really
helps the story unfold.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the story itself
is an amazing story.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing, in fact, more
interesting in American history

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.652 align:middle line:84%
than the corruption that
built Southern California.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The people coming
in from New York.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
First, the orange grove growers,
the farmers, and then they

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
steal the water, and then that
creates a viable atmosphere

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:90%
for Hollywood to exist.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:10%
And you watch this town
grow from 45,000 people

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:10%
at the beginning
of the 20th century

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:10%
to millions to the second
biggest city in America

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:10%
by the time we get to the '70s.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story
of Los Angeles

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
is encapsulated in Chinatown
in that it is all corrupt.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The beginnings of L.A. itself
were just massive corruption.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:10%
And so the whole
idea that corruption

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:10%
is what built Hollywood,
corruption is what built L.A.,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.405 align:middle line:10%
is really at the
crux of this movie.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I love the setting--

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:84%
this repackaging of the Dashiell
Hammett, James Ellroy-type

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
story, with the figure of
William Mulholland, who

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
represents the highest level
of corruption at the top.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have
this naive assumption

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that, well, you can
just go to the police

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and have your problems solved.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And the moral of
this whole story

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.892 align:middle line:90%
is that the police are owned.

00:03:49.892 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And we see so many
films even after

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that that are inspired by
Chinatown that, I think, do

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
a good job of representing
this storyline like LA

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Confidential or Black
Dahlia by Brian De Palma.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.605 align:middle line:84%
And it's a theme that
constantly pops up

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
but not one that we've
really touched on yet.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's also hints at
kind of the esoteric occult

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.157 align:middle line:84%
aspects in the background
of these elite,

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:84%
degenerate characters,
too, which we'll especially

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
see when we talk about Hodel
and Black Dahlia and things

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I think what's
fascinating is the fact that

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the time period
when you had a lot of public

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
works projects going-- like the
Hoover Dam and the idea behind

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the L.A. waterworks being this
public thing that then becomes

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
privatized, it requires a lot of
skullduggery and almost a kind

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:90%
of false flag that--

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It does--

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --that Mulholland organizes
in the storyline that leads

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
to the privatization where he's
going to control the water.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And we see this today with
these giant corporations

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
are going to say, wait, we own
all the water in this region.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Nestle.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we own the water.

00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and the
false flag of course,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:10%
that begins Chinatown is a fact
that Mulwray, who's Mulholland,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:10%
he's dumping water at
night to make it look like

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:10%
there's a water shortage when
there is no water shortage.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The control of
resources, exactly.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And so he's creating a
false water shortage,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:10%
killing the farmers,
which is avidly

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:10%
displayed in the courtroom
scene, and then draining--

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:10%
literally draining the
rest of all of this water

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:10%
down into L.A., sucking
the entire West dry.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And we know this is true because
the Owens Valley is losing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
all of its water,
there are lakes

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:90%
drying up all over California--

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
all hooked into this
gigantic aqueduct,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.360 align:middle line:84%
which is feeding Los Angeles,
which gets very little rain--

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
like eight or nine
inches a year of rain.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you see this
kind of giant sucking--

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
like almost Arconic
thing happening.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take all
the resources of the West

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.485 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into
Hollywood movies.

00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:57.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right, exactly.

00:05:57.215 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so crazy.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And he has that name
that then becomes so iconic

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.746 align:middle line:84%
for famous roads like
Mulholland Drive.

00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
think of all the dark,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.996 align:middle line:84%
mysterious,
nefarious things that

00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:84%
have happened on
Mulholland drive

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.807 align:middle line:84%
related to the Manson case,
and with Wonderland Avenue,

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
and Laurel Canyon, and all that.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.931 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
look at first, I think,

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is this scene that details this
elite privatization combined

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.782 align:middle line:84%
with just total
psychopathy and degeneracy.

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:27.581 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:28.687 align:middle line:90%

My father and I understand.

[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:10%
>> So at the climax of the film,
the Jack Nicholson's character

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:10%
is trying to figure out what
Faye Dunaway is hiding from

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:10%
him.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:10%
And all through the film,
she's been very elusive,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:10%
and hiding her identity, and
acting like she's other people,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:10%
and--

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Why she won't come out and
say exactly what's going on.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:90%
He can't figure it out--

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> He can't figure out.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.438 align:middle line:84%
>> --like why she's
covering for her dad.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:21.075 align:middle line:10%
>> I said I want the truth!

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And then finally,
he loses it.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:10%
She's pressed into to the wall.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:10%
He's got his nose almost
cut off, trying to go--

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.495 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE] after him.

00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:10%
>> He's got everybody after him.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he kind of
loses it because he's

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
tired of her lying, and he can't
understand why she's lying.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So he hits her to try to
get the truth out of her.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And he finds out that
she is protecting

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
a young girl who is her
daughter, but also her sister.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the
revelation that Mulwray

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
is having sex with his
daughter, and that he is not

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
just one of the most
corrupt people that's ever

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:84%
been involved in the world
of politics in Los Angeles,

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
he's also corrupt to the
core in his own life,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.264 align:middle line:90%
in his own values.

00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
important to talk about that

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
because I really believe this.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
that when you rise up

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
into the higher
realms of the elite,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.320 align:middle line:84%
you begin discovering
that they're

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
involved in some things that
are really disconcerting.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's really strange is
that this is a constant theme

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
in noir film and in
neo-noir is the--

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
there's almost always a
grotesque or some extreme level

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of perversion that's going
on amongst the high--

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.918 align:middle line:84%
when you think about the
Humphrey Bogart films,

00:08:34.918 --> 00:08:38.003 align:middle line:84%
there's a constant theme with
the dames and the broads,

00:08:38.003 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
you know-- all
these femme fatales

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that have the dark secret
and their connection

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to some high-level criminality
that oftentimes does evolve.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Even in older '40s and '50s
versions of these stories--

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.984 align:middle line:84%
pornography and
drug trafficking,

00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
which they couldn't
actually show,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
but they would hint at
in a lot of those films,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
like Glass Key and Laura
or these famous noir films.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
representation of that here.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, it just echoes
the constant refrain that's

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream media now--

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
public stories about high-level
degeneracy and perversion

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that involve these kinds of
trafficking, and sexual incest,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> My favorite uncle was
a high-ranking FBI agent,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and he served with J. Edgar
Hoover and all of that.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And right before he
died, I asked him

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
what his favorite
movie was, because he

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.797 align:middle line:84%
knew a lot about the world,
and he said Chinatown.

00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
He said Chinatown was a
movie that if you watch it

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
over and over, you'll
really begin to understand

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.402 align:middle line:90%
what this reality is all about.

00:09:40.402 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at the
time, I wasn't quite sure

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
what he was talking about.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I was young.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But now, I actually
see it, and I

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
can see it with the
recent revelations

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
about high-ranking
people in the government

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and what they're up to.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it's
always been here.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.341 align:middle line:90%
It's never gone away.

00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what
Robert Towne, the screenwriter,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:90%
is trying to say--

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that this is an ever-present
evil that is here now

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood, i.e. in the
'70s, when the film was built,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was here 30
years ago, and it

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:90%
will be here 30 years from now.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
kind of the warning out

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:90%
of the gate by Robert Towne.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:10%
I also find it interesting that
this is one of the only scripts

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:10%
that Polanski did
that he didn't write.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So he invested a
lot into a script

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
that he had nothing to do with.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think it was
just such a good script

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that he knew he couldn't
mess with it in any way.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
He probably wanted
to, but Towne had

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
created such a closed-off
system in the script,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't find any more
stories except the corruption.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, noir has the femme
fatale in every movie,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and frankly, there's
a lot of violence

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
against women in
film noir, basically,

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
because the woman is hiding
something from the protagonist.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's not really
the antagonist,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but she seems to
always, in these films,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
be working somehow
for the antagonist.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, when you think about
Maltese Falcon or Casablanca--

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.182 align:middle line:10%
in both of those films,
there's a secret, and--

00:11:06.182 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:10%
you know, is Bogie going to
get with the girl or not.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
he's just like, forget it.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:10%
>> And if we go into Roman
Polanski and his career,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:10%
we can see a very tragic story
of him as a young boy having

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:10%
to traipse across Poland
to escape the communists,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:10%
and then the Nazis.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:10%
And then he makes
some student films

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:10%
that are kind of interesting.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he finally
goes to Hollywood,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and I believe this is his first
Hollywood-- second Hollywood

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:90%
film.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
He did Rosemary's
Baby and then this.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And we can see
that he's bringing

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
this darkness of his early
life back into these movies.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:90%
He's a very dark character.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.635 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> He's consistently interested
in trauma and in overcoming

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.619 align:middle line:90%
trauma in some way.

00:11:54.619 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what we want
to look at in the next clip

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
is how the Faye Dunaway
character is still

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
under the thumb of
her corrupt father.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.274 align:middle line:84%
And even in that
final scene where

00:12:08.274 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
you think she's
going to get away,

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to break
free from this guy's control,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.212 align:middle line:84%
she's not able to because
he owns the police.

00:12:17.212 --> 00:12:18.012 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:18.012 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:10%
- Evelyn, you're
a disturbed woman.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:10%
You cannot hope to provide.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:10%
- Evelyn, put that gun away!

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Let the police handle this!

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:10%
- He owns the police!

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.991 align:middle line:10%
Get away from her.

00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:30.915 align:middle line:10%
- You'll have to kill me first.

00:12:30.915 --> 00:12:31.877 align:middle line:10%
- Get away!

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:32.839 align:middle line:90%
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So here, we have in
the climax of the film,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
her trying to get away from
her controlling father,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and she's not able
to break free.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:90%
She's traumatized.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think, an
overlooked aspect of this film

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that she's
been abused her whole life.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.045 align:middle line:84%
She's even abused by Jake
in her love relationships

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:90%
that she develops with him.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So she doesn't feel
that she can bond

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
with any of the male
characters at all,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's because of the trauma
that her dad has inflicted

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:90%
on her.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the real tragedy

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:84%
is that this is what
happens in the real world.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
If archetypal figures,
and parental figures

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, or people
that we look up to abuse,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that really messes up
people for their whole life.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of psychologists
have talked about this,

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
religions have
talked about this--

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
kind of fundamental,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
but that's what this
film is saying--

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:90%
is that people are being used.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
L.A. uses its citizens
through the parasitic sucking

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood is a kind
of parasitic entity.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And the male characters in
this film are very dark.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:90%
They're very abusive.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a
positive aspect to the film

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that Polanski is trying to
say, is that this abuse only

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
furthers the
problem, and it only

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.555 align:middle line:84%
allows these oligarchs and
elites to ruin the future.

00:13:53.555 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, also, you know, I
don't think we quite understand

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
in our current environment how
really violent the world was

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:90%
in the 1930s.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.838 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good point.

00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Very violent, male-dominated,
women had no rights--

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and we can clearly
see that they were

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
being used by the elites
for really terrible reasons.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think Polanski
should be applauded

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:90%
for showing all of this.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:10%
I think that showing
a ritual trauma

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:10%
and what it does
to generations--

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and the very frightful
shot near the end

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:10%
of the film after
Faye Dunaway dies,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:10%
where John Houston takes
her daughter in the way

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:10%
that he grabs her is very
suggestive-- that he's

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:10%
about to do the same
thing to her that he

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:10%
did to his daughter.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that is what
Polanski is trying to say.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways, Polanski
suffered his own abuse

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
as a kid trying to
escape Nazi Poland,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and I think that he's showing us
in all of his movies in a way,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that this trauma
plays a very bad thing

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.622 align:middle line:90%
on the human condition.

00:14:57.622 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is a--

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It perpetuates.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a common theme that he
has throughout his movies.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the next thing
that we want to look at is

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
the conversation between Jake
and Mulwray where they discuss

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%
owning the future.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny is that
we're kind of like Jake

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:90%
as the viewer.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
We're brought along
this storyline,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and we think naively.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think that
the existing power

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
structure and
system is therefore

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.109 align:middle line:90%
for our good-- for our benefit.

00:15:24.109 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we've even been a
little corrupt like Jake,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.459 align:middle line:84%
but we don't realize how
high the corruption can go.

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like Bill
Harford in Eyes Wide Shut.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't realize the levers
of the control above him.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when he steps into
that billionaire level game,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
he realizes it's a
different playing field.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what happens in
this scene, where he learns

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.104 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, the goal
here is not just

00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
making a million
dollars here and there,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.495 align:middle line:84%
but actually
controlling the future

00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
through the control
of resources.

me to be like the goal

is to control the future

If you look at like the

you can see that
they're continuously

his last years of his life--

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
he has all the
money in the world--

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to create machinations
that are not even going to be--

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to get
anything back from them

to go off into the future,

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
extrapolating into the

to get any benefit from it.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:90%

sense to basically--

Right?

>> Exactly.

And so what I want to
kind of address now

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that we've kind of
talked about Chinatown

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
is the other general
corruption that's

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles for which Roman
Polanski is somewhat connected

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.709 align:middle line:84%
>> And John Houston
and Jack Nicholson--

00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:90%
they all know about this.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So Roman had his illicit
sex with the 13-year-old girl

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:90%
at Jack Nicholson's house.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
shared a backyard together.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And Marlon had his
own predilections.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And they were good buddies.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And when Marlon Brando
died, Jack Nicholson

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:90%
bought his house.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You also have--

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I think Christian Brando died.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, he did.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Mysteriously.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Very mysteriously.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.536 align:middle line:90%
>> So a lot of weird deaths.

00:18:06.536 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And furthermore, Jack
Nicholson thought that his

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
mother was his sister
when he was growing up.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
She had an affair
early on, like when

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
she was very young, with
someone who is, we think,

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:90%
an elitist of some kind.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And Jack was born.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so her mother
became his mother,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and she became Jack's sister.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until he
was in his early 30s

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that he found out that,
actually, his sister was

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:90%
his mother.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think Towne knew this and
put it into the screenplay--

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh wow to kind of show you--

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So he could identify with
this Faye Dunaway character.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so there's a lot of
weirdness going on with these

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:90%
actors and with these directors.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And Polanski, of course,
has his own problems

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
in that just a few
years before Chinatown

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and right after Rosemary's Baby,
his wife was killed by the--

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sharon Tate.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>> --yeah, Sharon Tate was
killed by the Manson family,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:10%
supposedly.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.185 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's
ties to ritualism--

00:19:07.185 --> 00:19:07.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>> --Satanism being practiced
up in the Hollywood Hills,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
the fact that he made a movie
about Satanism just previous

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to this is a very odd
coincidence, I think.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, what's fascinating
is that this is neo-noir,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and the whole genre of noir,
as we said before in other

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.422 align:middle line:84%
episodes, is very
influenced by surrealism.

00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
prominent surrealists

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
was Man Ray-- that
very bizarre artist

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
who self-described
as a Luciferian.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And Man Ray was
believed to be connected

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.229 align:middle line:84%
to the circles of
the Black Dahlia.

00:19:37.229 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was friends with John
Houston, friends with Hodel,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
they all hung out, and partied,
and had orgies together,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:90%
according to the public record.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
that we're looking

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
at a very dark background
that is maybe--

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
maybe Polanski's
films are his way

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of trying to deal with
this-- kind of trying

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.125 align:middle line:84%
to process all of this
darkness that he's been around.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with that.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, a lot of it
is revelation of the method.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
they're are actually

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.465 align:middle line:84%
showing us what goes down in
Hollywood in the background.

00:20:07.465 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, I go back
to things that we've

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
touched on before
with the David McGowan

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:90%
series on Laurel Canyon--

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
how this continued
into the '70s,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and how Polanski, during
the making of Chinatown,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
must have been aware of
this secret studio that

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
was atop of Laurel Canyon and
all of the strange business

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that was going on in
Laurel Canyon at the time.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.345 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in Laurel
Canyon with Sharon Tate,

00:20:33.345 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
murders took place

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:90%
was at Roman Polanski's house.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's just so many
strange things going on

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
at that time period
that you really

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:84%
have to zoom back
to get a bigger

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:90%
picture of what's happening.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, one thing I think
that's interesting about

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Polanski, as you said, is that
he's in these circles of all

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:84%
these people who are involved
in a lot of this dark stuff.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.434 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of his world--

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:90%
for better or for ill.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, so the
artwork that he makes--

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I think he's just putting
out there what he knows

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and what he's seen.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is,
I think, bad stuff.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.722 align:middle line:84%
He tries to dress it up
and make it attractive,

00:21:12.722 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
especially when we look at
something like Ninth Gate.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:10%
But at times, he'll make
films that are very positive,

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:10%
like Oliver Twist, which I
thought he did a good job at.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>> He did do a good job.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:10%
Great film.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's not always
bad with Polanski,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:10%
but what you have here is him
showing that the elite are

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:10%
involved in the very
things that are illegal.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.354 align:middle line:84%
So the people that
run the police--

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
the police are the ones who
are supposed to be controlling

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:90%
the vices, right?

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:90%
The vice department.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
They're owned by the
guys who own the vices.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
he just sees it

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
as kind of a giant
contradiction, a giant game,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.982 align:middle line:90%
a giant absurdism.

00:21:48.982 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Because he's partying
with all the people

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
who are buddies with the mayor,
and the governor of L.A.,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's who he
parties with, and he

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.165 align:middle line:90%
sees what they're really doing.

00:21:59.165 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So from his vantage
point, I think he sees it

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.025 align:middle line:90%
as just giant contradictions.

00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and again, like
you brought up Oliver Twist,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about--

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:10%
he's still kind of
enthralled by the corruption,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:10%
even in a positive
movie like that.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:10%
He still wants to show you
the nugget of corruption

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:10%
that destroys the boys' lives--

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:10%
the pickpockets--
and I think he's

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:10%
doing the same thing in
Chinatown, where he's trying

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:10%
to show you the corruption.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think he is working
it out in some ways.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I think he feels maybe
a little bit ashamed

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:84%
that he got accepted into
these big places and, you know,

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.036 align:middle line:84%
the manipulation
that they're doing,

00:22:35.036 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and I think he's
trying to work it out.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, he's
enthralled by it, I think.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he probably was
the one who took the rap.

00:22:42.174 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't imagine he
was the only person doing

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:90%
illegal things in these circles.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you're right.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But he's the one
that ends up, you know,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
banished to France, essentially.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
he's good; I'm just

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
saying that that's
what happened,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
historically-- he was
convicted of these things.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think that he's running
in these circles of people

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:90%
who were--

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
he's making films
about corrupt people,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.085 align:middle line:84%
and if you're running
in those circles,

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to expect that
you might get screwed over

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
by these corrupt people if
you're involved in their stuff.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were the
elite of Hollywood,

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.256 align:middle line:84%
and they could get
anything they wanted,

00:23:12.256 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:90%
and they acted that way.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that even though
this is really dark imagery

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult, these are
culturally important films.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
They're ranked by most
critics, by most academics,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
by most film institutes, and
academies, as, you know--

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
this is usually even maybe in
the top 10 of American films.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important
for that reason,

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.000 align:middle line:90%
and we have to look at it--

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
we have to consider and
be aware of it, just

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
as a cultural
artifact, you know.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.506 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that much
of Gothic literature that we

00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
talked about was
very important--

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Faulkner, Flannery
O'Connor, I mean,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:90%
these contain dark themes--

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:90%
even, at times, Mark Twain.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But they're still important
for their significance--

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
for their symbolic
value and meaning.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so even though we obviously
condemn the treatment of women,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I think Polanski's
showing us that that

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:84%
was a period that was
brutal, and women were not

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:90%
treated well then.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.227 align:middle line:84%
And so the extension
of rights to women

00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:84%
is something that's much
more positive in our day.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot more freedom
and rights than they had then,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
a positive thing.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think
that Chinatown is slowly

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
climbing its way into the very
top echelon of best movies

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.510 align:middle line:90%
ever made.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that's another reason
we had to include it in this.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.517 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is
really a good movie.

00:24:26.517 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's up there with
Vertigo, and Citizen Kane,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and 2001 as one of the
best films ever made.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And Polanski deserves
a lot of credit

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:84%
for having the guts to
make a film like this.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's hard to watch.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's brutal in its honesty
about the way the world was

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s, especially
towards women,

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.785 align:middle line:84%
and I think kudos to Polanski
for actually showing that.

00:24:51.785 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I think we can
say that objectively about

00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
a creation of art without making
a moral statement or a moral

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
promotion of the
person themselves.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can condemn his
beliefs, and lifestyle,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.215 align:middle line:84%
and the actions that
he's committed--

00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> And still like his film.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --and still appreciate
his artistic creation.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I really think that
it's the art not

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.945 align:middle line:90%
the artist that's important.

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think that even
the darkest aspects

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of our experience, they actually
serve a purpose in the grander

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
scheme or in Providence--
divine Providence or whatever--

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to actually show us the reality
of the good and that the good

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
is actually stronger and
actually overcomes evil.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I firmly believe that.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that even somebody
who is not a very respectable

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
character-- they're not totally
evil, so they're still--

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
even in their
artwork, they're going

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to have some aspect of
the good that comes out.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
we look at Ninth Gate,

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
the film ends with
that same idea.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It's another Polanski
film that shows that even

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of this
darkness, it actually

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:84%
is something that leads
us back to the light

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
because darkness is
negation; it's privation,

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient
philosophers used to say.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:90%
It's non-being.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:90%
It's nothingness.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And we crave existence.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
We crave life.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
We crave the fullness of being,
as Aristotle used to say.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if we
think about it that way,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it actually puts us back on
the road towards the good.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that
uncovering darkness can lead you

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It tells us what to avoid.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> What to avoid--

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I often use the analogy of--

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
my generation went to Vietnam,
and when we came back,

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
we actually saw what
violence was really like.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And we began making movies
that depicted violence

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.817 align:middle line:84%
as it really was, not a little
bullet hole going into someone,

00:26:39.817 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
a little blood coming
out, or anything

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:90%
like that, it was real.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were criticized by
our parents' generation

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
as encouraging violence and
making it like it was OK.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.944 align:middle line:84%
But actually, people
watched those violent movies

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:54.485 align:middle line:84%
and didn't want to
go to war anymore.

00:26:54.485 --> 00:26:55.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:55.285 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't want to
be involved in violence,

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
which was really cool before the
violent movies and very uncool

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
at the other end of
the violent movies.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think Polanski
is revealing to us

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:84%
the corruption that we really
didn't know about, even

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:90%
in 1974.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.487 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we can see that we
have to make this world better.

00:27:15.487 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to make sure
the elites aren't

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.860 align:middle line:84%
doing this to their
children, and to us,

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.292 align:middle line:90%
and make a better world.

00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:90%
And I think we actually have.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.459 align:middle line:84%
I think the world is
a better place now

00:27:24.459 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
than it was in the 1930s.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that if most people
have the false impression that

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:84%
if they can attain
wealth, they can status,

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:90%
they're going to have it made.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.786 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying
to shoot for getting out

00:27:36.786 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
of the middle class maybe
and into that upper echelon,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
but what Polanski is showing
you is that just attaining

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:90%
some status of wealth--

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:84%
the people in that
class, so to speak,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:84%
are most often very miserable,
and they're very corrupt.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So just attaining
some class is not

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
going to give you the
satisfaction that you're

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:90%
seeking for.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think Polanski probably
found that out himself--

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.908 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. --coming from
a poor background,

00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
making it, and then realizing
that all he was surrounded with

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:90%
were corrupt people.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.618 align:middle line:90%
>> And he was corrupt, too.

00:28:05.618 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Join us again next time
