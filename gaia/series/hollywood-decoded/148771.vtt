a very esoteric,

philosophically heavy
trilogy from the Wachowskis.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And we chose it because it deals
with these perennial themes

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:84%
like Plato's "Allegory
of the Cave."

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like those lights
flickering on the wall.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The people that are
caught in the matrix

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
think that they're
actually watching reality.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and turns him into
what he became.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's a great movie.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about redemption
and the Gnostic ideas

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're being controlled
by a demiurge, a false god

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're embedded
in a false reality.

to see the White Rabbit and how

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.595 align:middle line:84%
it relates to the
"Simulacra and Simulation."

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stuff
going on in this scene.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
So we notice that Neo--

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
we didn't see it,
but he's actually

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
doing his hacking stuff.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And he gets an IM
from Trinity and it's

leading him to go to this
club and ultimately meet her.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:10%

attention, he's actually

this book that's a very
famous philosophical work.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And throughout "The
Matrix" trilogy

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be several
key books that are placed

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:90%
in the background for a reason.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Here, this is Jean Baudrillard's
"Simulacra and Simulation."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And that deals with
the world as synthetic.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
That we've been actually
fooled and duped

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
into this kind of
matrix reality,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
not just in the sense of the
whole world but that technology

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
is taking us into a real
matrix being constructed.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is actual stuff that
the Pentagon and DARPA deal

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
with, that you can
actually create

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
an inner link between
the brain and, you know,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
the internet and so forth.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think this,
on so many levels,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
is showing us not just
where we're going,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
but reaching back into
ancient philosophy and Plato,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and modern philosophy,
postmodernism

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
with Baudrillard, all
kinds of stuff going on.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you saw, his
address was 101.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Binary code which is
what makes up the matrix.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The White Rabbit has many
symbols associated with mind

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:10%
control in "Alice in
Wonderland" and the whole thing.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this is,
again, the opposite,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
though, he is mind-controlled
at the beginning

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and he's actually going
to get un-mindcontrolled

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:90%
by the White Rabbit.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the opposite
of how they're usually

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:90%
portraying these things.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to see a lot of
terminology that's used, too,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that's like Zion and Trinity,
but they're given new meanings,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:84%
they're given of Gnostic
meanings in this trilogy.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to make of this,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
but, as we're going to see in
this next scene in this clip,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of
predictive programming in this.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:10%
One of the guys who worked
on the technical aspects

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:10%
of this film is Paul Debevec.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And back in the
90s, early 90s, he

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:10%
had actually perfected
his CGI to where

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:10%
you couldn't tell the difference
between reality and CGI.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
He later went on to work
with DARPA in the Pentagon.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think that "The
Matrix" is actually,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
in many ways showing us,
not just this mythology,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
but, again, where
technology really could go

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and how we could
actually be duped.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.193 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't trust
what's on mainstream media.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
what's going on.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We can't just buy
the mainstream story.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.649 align:middle line:84%
And the matrix itself even
shows us that with Morpheus

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:90%
being portrayed as a terrorist.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.023 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to see
in this next scene, when

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
agent Smith has Neo
there being questioned,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, interrogated,
why do they have the date--

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
this is 1999-- as
September 11, 2001?

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:90%
That's Neo's passport date.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And just for a second,
I'd like to touch on some

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:90%
of the names of the people.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Trinity is, of course, three.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And in sacred geometry
and in Hermetics

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
everything kind of
evolves from the three.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, one is a single
unit and two is duality

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.017 align:middle line:84%
and then three is what
duality gives birth to.

00:05:06.017 --> 00:05:06.816 align:middle line:90%
>> The triad.

00:05:06.816 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is three,
four, five, six,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
seven and all the
rest of the numbers.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But they all have to start
out with these three.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at some of the
philosophies from, say, India,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
they're all built around
this idea of a trinity.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:84%
That an idea within
the human brain

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:90%
always has three aspects to it.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:10%
So the Indians, the
Vedic teachings,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:10%
teach it's consciousness,
time, and space are the three

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.706 align:middle line:10%
aspects of this reality.

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also past,
present, and future.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva
are also the three aspects

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:90%
of this to tri-enity.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
kind of amazing

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that the person who is the
impetus for this journey

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that Neo is taking is named
Trinity and it's a woman.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.249 align:middle line:84%
Union is very
important in alchemy.

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have the male
principle and you also

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.498 align:middle line:84%
have the Sophia
principle that have

00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to be united for the final, you
know, final state of matter.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.834 align:middle line:84%
When matter transcends it
becomes a Philosopher's stone,

00:06:05.834 --> 00:06:06.633 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.175 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
that union first.

00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:10.591 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately what
we're going to see in the film.

00:06:10.591 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But this passport
scene is fascinating.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I've always seen this as
one of the most amazing

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
instances predictive
programming.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a social security
number, you pay your taxes,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and you help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
The other life is
lived in computers

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:84%
where you go by the
hacker alias Neo

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and are guilty of
virtually every computer

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
crime we have a law for.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:90%
One of these lives has a future.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.506 align:middle line:90%
One of them does not.

00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
you're here because
we need your help.

who calls himself Morpheus.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
He is considered
by many authorities

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
to be the most
dangerous man alive.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.466 align:middle line:84%
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now we're willing to
wipe the slate clean,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:90%
give you a fresh start.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
All that we're asking in
return is your cooperation

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in bringing a known
terrorist to justice.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly, this is
predictive programming,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:10%
And you have to watch
it really close,

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:10%
maybe you might even have
to freeze your Blu-Ray

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:10%
or DVD to see that the
date is 2001, right?

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:10%
9/11, 2001.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:10%
So maybe a quick excursus of
somewhat predictive programming

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:10%
is.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it's this
notion of conditioning people

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to what's going to come, right?

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So that maybe the subconscious
sees these images and records

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
it and then when it actually
happens in the real world,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
we're a lot more
willing to accept it.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.192 align:middle line:90%
We've been conditioned.

00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of predictive
programming had

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to prepare us for
the Panopticism

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that we got with Philip K
Dick and "Minority Report"

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and accepting this total
surveillance, right?

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.266 align:middle line:84%
Because we've seen it
so many times in fiction

00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that we just feel
like it's inevitable.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I saw that 10
years ago in that movie.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I guess it's here now.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the way it's
got to be, right?

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah it's like putting on
a pair of old jeans, you know?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I've worn
these so many times,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:90%
it conformed to my body.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see this
predictive programming

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.379 align:middle line:84%
and then pretty soon, it's like,
oh, I knew this all the time.

00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this is
a scene where they're

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:90%
talking about terrorists--

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> --And Morpheus is a terrorist
and that his passport is

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
the date of the biggest
terrorist event in history

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:90%
cannot be an accident.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this before in
the "Back to the Future" films.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Where there does
seem to be people

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in the know trying to pass
information downstream.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.605 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, that
passport calendar date

00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of
the most astonishing

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
predictive programing
ever in film history.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So, as Neo has come
out of his false reality

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and he's joined his merry band
of rebels and revolutionaries,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
he's going to see the
source code, right?

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
He's going to understand that
reality is constructed kind

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
of like the Cabalists
saw it as a kind

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of numerical or linguistic code,
like all of reality itself.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen
this in other films

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as well, like "2001" where
the fabric of reality

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:90%
is these platonic solids, right?

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in this sequence, this is
where he realizes he's the one.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:90%
[GUNFIRE]

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.951 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If we go back,
as we said before,

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to Platonism and we think
about how reality is structured

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way to have form
and that even at the smallest

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
level of reality,
there's a kind of code.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:90%
We think about DNA, right?

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
DNA is a coding sequence that
makes life forms what they are.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:27.175 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:10%
>> He is the one.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:10%
>> In the hermetic tradition,
a number is at the core

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:10%
of reality.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the only thing that is
actually real because it can ca

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
quantified.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
number, from the number

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
of atoms and
molecules that we have

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
in our body to the number of
gut organisms we have in us.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And everything is this kind
of result of a measure.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Measure.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And geometry and number are
at the heart of our reality.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the heart of the Matrix
is this numerical system which

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:90%
drives and informs everything.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I'll point
out about "The Matrix"

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
is if you want to know
if you're in the Matrix

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or not while you're watching
the film, if the shot has

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:84%
a green tint to it,
you're in the Matrix.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.224 align:middle line:84%
If the green tint is gone,
you're out of the Matrix.

00:11:16.224 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
clever little thing

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.116 align:middle line:84%
that the Wachowskis did to
just tint the film a little bit

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you know
you're in the Matrix.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And what "The Matrix"
also is is Neo

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is that guy in
Plato's Allegory who

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
breaks free of the
chains of the cave

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and goes out to the
mouth of the cave

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and actually sees
what the world--

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Sees the sunlight.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Sees world as it really is.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Percy Shelley did a great
poem about all of this.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I think what's kind of
disappointing about the sequels

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
of "The Matrix" is that
he's been fully individuated

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the film.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why you feel so
good by the end of the film

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
because you realize he has
reached his full apex of power

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
so there really isn't anywhere
to go with this story.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Now they did do some interesting
things in the next two films

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
with the Merovingian
and the architect

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and how the universe is
a Masonic control system.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was really good.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
But the real point of this
movie is the liberation

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
of Neo from his sleep, from
his Morpheus, the god of sleep,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:84%
who helps him rise
from the dreamworld

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and face the world
as it really is.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And to come to understand
that there is a demiurge.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a false
god making a world

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and telling us that
this is the real world.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And Neo's buddies
are saying, no.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a very Sophianic
rebellion against this.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
pointed out that there

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
have been many Sophianic
rebellions in our past

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and all of them
have been violently

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:90%
put down by the powers that be.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
As if the one kind
of mythos that's

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
not allowed to be
spoken in public

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is this whole
Gnostic mythos where

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
outside force of feminine
energy comes and creates

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
this world and
then these archons

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:11.019 align:middle line:84%
come and try to create a
prison around that creation.

00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's what this
movie is really about.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a matrix, we think
of the matrix of the womb

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:10%
of a woman.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this matrix gives
birth to this figure Neo.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Neo means new, right?

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:90%
So he is the new man.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, this
is kind of Nietzschean.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Ubermensch, Nietzsche
talked about this,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Communists tried to
adopt it, Che Guevara

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
thought that all
of the collective

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.650 align:middle line:90%
could be the new man.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And Nietzsche proposed it
would actually be an individual

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.535 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
new man, so to speak.

00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So he is the real avatar,
which is how they make sense

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:90%
of him being fully actualized.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But how are we going
to have sequels?

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, there were all
these other Neos that came

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and they failed.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
But this is the Neo Neo, right?

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
He's the real Neo.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.613 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
think a lot of people

00:13:52.613 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
felt cheated that
they kept milking it.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I understand, it's Hollywood.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And they added enough stuff
to make it interesting.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They've really never
been able to recover

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
as filmmakers, the Wachowskis.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens when
one of your first films

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is so great, so amazing that you
can never achieve this again.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you can't.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
In the Hermetic tradition,
in sacred geometry,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
two kinds of one.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Neo is, of course,
an anagram for one.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's the one, which is
the totality of the universe.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the one as a unit.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So in this film we
actually have Neo

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
going from one as a unit to
one as totality in which he is

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:90%
the master of this world now.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that is a
beautiful double entendre

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
on how they're using the
word one in this movie.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again,
it's going from the many

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:90%
to the single within himself.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
That is what's important here.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:10%
And to show those numbers--

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:10%
And also, you have
notice that everything

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:10%
is going down in this film,
everything is moving downwards.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like it's
a transformer that's

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:10%
taking a higher voltage--

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:10%
>> But at the end
he flies, you know?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Finally, he's
liberated and he flies.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.571 align:middle line:84%
So after the whole
movie of everything kind

00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of going down, finally,
at the end of the movie,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
he's liberated.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:90%
And we feel that.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:84%
We feel that when
we're watching it.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So binary is all
about dialectics, right?

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
dialectical tensions

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and the black and the white
and, you know, all that before.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But what is happening
in this sequence is

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that the awakening
for him is, just

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
like in "2001" with Bowman, he's
transcending the limitations

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
of space and time.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So our reality is night/day,
black/white, dialectic.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck in that.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.924 align:middle line:90%
>> That duality.

00:15:40.924 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we transcend that?

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is what they're
trying to say with Neo, here,

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
because he can stop the bullets,
he can see the source code,

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:90%
he can fly, he's like Superman.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:90%
He's Ubermensch, basically, now.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the duality gives
birth to a single, to a what.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.712 align:middle line:84%
>> And just like it takes
two parents to make a child.

00:15:58.712 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what's going on, here.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
The whole movie is about the
duality of our fake existence

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:90%
under the demiurge.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And then how once
we remove ourselves

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of fake reality,
we can have one as a totality.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
It's also going
to be weird, too,

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because at the end
of the film, he's

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
going to submit to
the master program

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:90%
to defeat the architect.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the bots are run by a
program, the Architect, and he

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
allows himself to be this
sort of savior figure.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting, because
at the end of the film,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.301 align:middle line:84%
he's basically going
to give himself,

00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
give his life up in a kind of
sacrificial offering to trick

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Agent Smith, the rebel
program, into coming into him

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and being destroyed.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's very close
to the Sophianic myths where

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Sophia gives up her goddess-hood
to come here to earth to make

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
things, you know,
solidify her creations.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, she
has to take in all

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:84%
of the evil in order for her to
create and become more godlike.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:84%
So Neo sacrifices himself, which
is really what the Christos

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
myth is about self-sacrifice.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.026 align:middle line:84%
>> So I read "The Matrix" as a
retelling of Plato's "Allegory

00:17:14.026 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Cave," straight
out of "The Republic."

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
it's just the simple message
of this reality being false,

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
there's another one out there,
and a lot of what we've been

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:84%
told in perennial philosophy in
Cabbalism about how the world

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is structured in this kind
of binary code, like DNA,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is true and those are the kind
of [? seekers ?] that are going

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to lead us towards
transcendence.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It is about the--

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
just like Bowman in
"2001"-- it's about Neo

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
represents us as a human
race freeing ourselves

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.805 align:middle line:84%
from the matrix of control
and being liberated as a race.

00:17:47.805 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> "Matrix Reloaded" takes up
where the last one left off

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and introduces a bunch
of new mythology.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Something very curious,
the Merovingian mythos,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:84%
which is this idea of
Illuminati bloodlines out

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of France connected to
Charlemagne and so forth

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and is this a real
occult secret society.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:84%
The Merovingian is
going to present

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
vampirism and that
parasitic type of feeding

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:90%
on other life forms.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, of course,
the way of all things.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You see, there is only one
constant, one universe,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
it is the only real truth.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Causality, action,
reaction, cause and effect.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything
begins with choice.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Choice is an illusion
created between those

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%
with power and those without.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.261 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Look there at that woman.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.601 align:middle line:90%
My God, just look at her.

00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we have this enigmatic
figure of the Merovingian,

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:84%
he represents this high level
blood line out of France,

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And what he's going to do is
try to entrap Neo, right so?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.307 align:middle line:84%
This is the next phase
of Neo's process.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.848 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to learn about
the architect here in a minute

00:19:03.848 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and that the
Merovingian actually

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:90%
works for the Architect.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.917 align:middle line:84%
So what is it with this
Merovingians stuff?

00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think they
introduced this in the film?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was very curious.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.721 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't even understand

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
what the Merovingians
were, who they were.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
They were a group of kings in
France in the first 1,000 years

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
There were rumors that
their name, Merovingian,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
is a combination
of Mary Magdalene

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and that they were the
direct result of a wedding

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
or a marriage between
Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene, of course,
had to escape, go to France

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:90%
while she was pregnant.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is even a church
in the south of France

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to Mary Magdalene
with a big boat on the altar

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene
and her two assistants

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and she's very much pregnant.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's true
or not, I don't know.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But there are a group
of people in France

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
who seriously believe this
beyond any shadow of a doubt.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.659 align:middle line:10%
>> The British nobility, the
British crown also traces its--

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:10%
they believe that they
are decendents from Jesus.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:10%
>> They do.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.763 align:middle line:10%
>> That they're
related to King David.

00:20:10.763 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So this may sound
far-fetched, but this

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is the actual mythology
of European nobility.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
They think they have this
divine bloodline, basically.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that when we
talk about "The Da Vinci Code"

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
be very interesting.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But the Merovingians
were a magical people

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
who could affect people
with their magic.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:84%
They had tremendous charisma
and had really long hair

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.887 align:middle line:84%
and they got their power
from their hair, they said.

00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Which is very interesting.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well so, this
character, interestingly,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
what he's proposing is that
it's all determined, right?

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And he does this
cause/effect relationship

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
with this woman who's at
his restaurant, right?

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's trying to
demonstrate to Neo's band

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of revolutionaries that
there is no free will.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It is all literally a computer
program that we live in,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:90%
a simulation.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.145 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if that's
true, there is no free will.

00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And what does Morpheus say?

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:90%
No, it's all about choice.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It's all about free will.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's a recurring
theme in the film

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
is part of transcending the
duality or the determinism

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of this reality is to
prove or to demonstrate

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:90%
that we have free will.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Merovingians,
in a way, they

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
were in control of the
country's free will for hundreds

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and hundreds of years.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of odd things occurred
within France at that time,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
from the Templars
to the Cathars.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
what we can see is

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
that it's possibly
the Merovingians are

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
behind the whole Templar
trip to Jerusalem

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
where they learned the
secrets of alchemy and money

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and banking and all
these esoteric things

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
that they took back to Europe.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.614 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
they're trying to say here,

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is that the very origins
of this secret society

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:90%
started with the Merovingians.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And Neo is in a
way discovering this.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're on
the journey with Neo

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
discovering all this secret
society arcana and lore.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And next we're going to
see the Keymaster, which

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:84%
is this weird
figure who pops up,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
who's able to kind of, in a
way, do Solomonic magic, right?

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
He can open these
spiritual portals

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and so forth in the
midst of the Matrix

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's very
Freemasonic, too, by the way.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Keymaker brings
to mind the Key of Solomon,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
which is this purported magical
text that King Solomon had

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
the ability to call forth demons
and make them do his bidding,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.158 align:middle line:84%
They could construct the
temple at his bidding.

00:22:38.158 --> 00:22:39.285 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Neo.

00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'm the Keymaker.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting for you.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.755 align:middle line:84%
>> They could also seemingly
appear out of nowhere.

00:22:47.755 --> 00:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You get the idea of portals
and so forth and dimensions.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And what is weird
is that when Neo

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
gets to this level
of his understanding

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is where he's starting to
figure out that he can not just

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
stop bullets, but he has a much
wider control over the Matrix.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like he's
becoming a better magician,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we almost might say, by
defeating these other magicians

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:90%
like the Merovingians.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a church in the
south of France associated with

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the Merovingians where a certain
father, Father [INAUDIBLE],,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
may have possibly discovered an
underground tunnel system with

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:90%
gold and Templar treasure.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
into his church,

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
there is a sign
above the church,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.812 align:middle line:84%
"this is a terrible
place" in French.

00:23:29.812 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And then as you go
into the church,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:90%
there is a statue of Asmodeus.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Asmodeus was the guardian
of Solomon's temple.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this Solomonic
magic is very

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
replete within this whole
Merovingian Freemasonry

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.709 align:middle line:84%
And there are key makers
within the Freemasonic rituals

00:23:49.709 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
that they're the ones that allow
you to pass through the door

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
to the next level of initiation.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.585 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's going
on here with Neo.

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
He's moving from one
level of initiation

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
to another through
these two sequels.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So the next scene we're
going to look at is the curious

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
architecture and symbology in
the of Merovingian's palace,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
which I thought was significant
because it is a seven sided

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:90%
star within a hexagram.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And this actually is
Crowley's star of Babalon.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:84%
A very quick sequence,
but on the floor

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you could see three
people holding a ring.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have this trinitarian
aspect in the middle.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the hexagonal star,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the hexagram, which
is also Solomonic magic.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the image that Solomon
used to control the demons.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And then on the outside of that
you have the seven sided star.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of those together
actually make up

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Crowley's own personal
design of the star

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of Babylon, of the
Babylon word game.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Six sided star is a hex and
that's what you put on people

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
when you're putting spells on
people, you put a hex on them.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what a hex does is it
fixes you in the cube of space.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there's six
sides to the cube.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back to
the monolith in "2001"

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other symbology
that we're talking about.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is is
six is everything is fixed

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and then seven is
the number of life.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you move from
this fixed place

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
to this enlivened place in
the sacred geometry of that,

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's what Neo's doing.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
He's moving from the
fixed to the supranatural.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also a scene that
we didn't see but if you notice

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
it, Monica Bellucci goes to the
wall and she takes a book off

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to open up a secret passageway
which is where they met

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:90%
the Keymaster.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And that book is Arthur
Schopenhauer's "World

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.345 align:middle line:90%
as Will and Representation."

00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting
because that's

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
very close to Nietzscheism
because Schopenhauer

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
sees the world as just
kind of this willing,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
this power of willing
that the one, Neo, right,

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.370 align:middle line:84%
who's going to make his
way into this apotheosis,

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that he must traverse
this long journey.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's very
Nietzschean, too.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So sure Schopenhauer had a
huge influence on Nietzsche.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.796 align:middle line:84%
For the next scene that
we're going to look at

00:26:05.796 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
is the introduction
of the Architect.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get really
obviously overtly Masonic,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The great architect of the
universe who's this old bearded

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
white dude who they say was
supposed to be Sean Connery

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.409 align:middle line:90%
as the Architect.

00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't, he didn't want
to do this for whatever reason.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
He probably thought this
was like some weird thing

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.609 align:middle line:90%
he didn't want to do it.

00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But it would have made
sense because had it

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
been Sean Connery, he's actually
played that Masonic role before

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:90%
in "The Man Who Would Be King."

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Great film.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The first Matrix I designed
was quite naturally perfect.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
It was a work of art,
flawless, sublime,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:84%
a triumph equaled only
by its monumental figure.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.180 align:middle line:84%
The inevitability of its
doom is apparent to me

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
now as a consequence
of the imperfection

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
inherent in every human being.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Thus I redesigned it
based on your history

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to more accurately
reflect the varying

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:90%
grotesqueries of your nature.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
However, I was again
frustrated by failure.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.665 align:middle line:84%
>> So here we have the demiurge
who's created this Matrix.

00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's interesting
that they use a term that

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:84%
the Freemasons use
for God, essentially,

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:90%
the architect of the universe.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But he turns out to be the
false god, the demiurge,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%
who is in control of all of us.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's very interesting
and very mature,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
actually, for a film
to be portraying this.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have to wonder
where the Wachowskis got

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this
Gnostic information

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't that
available in the late 90s.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism really
hasn't resurged

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.587 align:middle line:84%
until after "The
Matrix" films came out.

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I have since come to
understand that the answer

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
eluded me because it
required a lesser mind,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps a mind less bound by
the parameters of perfection.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:84%
thus the answer it was stumbled
upon by another, an intuitive

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
program initially created to
investigate certain aspects

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.730 align:middle line:90%
of the human psyche.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
If I am the father
of the Matrix,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:84%
she would undoubtedly
be its mother.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we just saw was the
Architect in this white suit,

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the kids
idea of who God would be.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:84%
This old bearded guy
sitting there in a suit.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And what does he have?

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:84%
A panopticism of
screens all around him

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
where he watches and
profiles and tries

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of every
human being, right?

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Something like the NSA
or something like that.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's faulty, right?

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The Architect sits there
sort of pompous and tries

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to explain the problem of Neo
and his free will and choice,

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and how he can't stamp that out.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the Architect
that is the problem here,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:10%
It's not humans,
it's not free will.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And he can't grasp the fact that
humans are not just flat facts,

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.167 align:middle line:84%
that they actually have
creativity and individuality.

00:28:49.167 --> 00:28:51.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, again we go back
to the constant themes that

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about here of
individualism and the attempt

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:84%
by the powers that
be to snuff that out.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Architect is definitely
the bad guy in this film,

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:90%
there's no doubt.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>> He's even set against
the feminine principle.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.504 align:middle line:84%
You know, he talks
about the Oracle

00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and they don't like each other,
you know, they're at odds.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until
the third installment

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that they kind of reconcile and
they create this new utopia.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So "Matrix Reloaded" was
interesting in that it did take

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
us into other esoteric
territory that the first one

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't investigate.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And they brought in
this Merovingian mythos

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and this idea of
the Priory of Sion

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked about the
bloodline that was missing.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't
really note the fact

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's some sort
of vampirism involved

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Merovingian, right?

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
There's vampires that
they're watching,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
they're watching some vampire
movie, his henchmen are.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
very vampiric about him.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
He's basically a
master of lust, right?

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:90%
You said he's charismatic.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:90%
He's all about baser desires.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
What Neo's learning
is that it's not

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
just that there's this Matrix,
it's that humans are also

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
controlled, like the guy
who sold everybody out

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in the first "Matrix," he just
wanted a good steak, right?

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Now it's about the
seven deadly sins,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:90%
let's be tempted with lust.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's about overcoming
all these temptations

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and not being ruled
by baser desires.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly with
Plato in "The Republic"

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:84%
said would control the
masses, baser desires.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> He's controlling us through
that and it's not working

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.278 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's
complaining about.

00:30:29.278 --> 00:30:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he says it's
all causal determinism.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the final installment,
we have the closure,

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.775 align:middle line:84%
which is the machines
make their final move.

00:30:39.775 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
out Zion, they're

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:84%
ready to completely
stamp out humanity.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We had that sermon
from Agent Smith

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:84%
earlier on about how
humans are a disease,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.854 align:middle line:84%
you know, you stink, he
can't stand the foul smell.

00:30:51.854 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's ready to
just stamp them out.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're almost
going to win, right?

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
They've almost got
rid of humanity.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And then Neo figures out that
the way to destroy the Matrix

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.620 align:middle line:90%
is not to--

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
you can't take it out because
it's got these giant armaments,

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So what he does is that
he basically gives himself

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to the Matrix, right?

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
He's going to have to
bait Agent Smith, that's

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the only way to destroy it,
to become one with Smith.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.127 align:middle line:90%
Unbeknownst to Smith, right?

00:31:20.127 --> 00:31:20.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
They have to be surprised,
for sure, for this to work.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it still seems a little
bit against the plot that Smith

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't know this.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, instead
of the Architect,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Neo realizes that he's going
to have to bypass the Architect

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and go to the source,
as it's called,

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
which is basically the
central bot or whatever it is,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:42.951 align:middle line:90%
this grid.

00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:44.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Where the
archons are created.

00:31:44.324 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, right.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.954 align:middle line:84%
So this is where Neo goes and
then he sort of makes a deal,

00:31:47.954 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:90%
he bargains with them.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
He says, look, your problem
is my problem and it's Smith.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.137 align:middle line:84%
Smith is going to
take you over and me.

00:31:54.137 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:90%
He's going to stamp us both out.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we work together,
we'll get rid of agent Smith.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Goodbye Agent Smith.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine the entire
world, or the Matrix world,

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:90%
coming under the sway of Smith.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It is as if the CIA has
completely brain controlled,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.280 align:middle line:84%
mind controlled
the entire world.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.109 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's become a Smith,
they're all clones of Smith,

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:90%
and there's no way out of this.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And so Neo realizes
that the only way is

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to bait Agent Smith
into coming into him,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.760 align:middle line:84%
right, this union, and
then that destroys Smith.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And the pose at the
end, the Christ-like pose,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
he's the Christos who has come
to assist Sophia in organizing

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the chaotic reality that she's
created and the Matrix is this

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
attempt to control nature, but
eventually natural forces will

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
always win out.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And Agent Smith is destroyed.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would point
out again that all

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
of the creations of the
Matrix all look the same.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> They can't come up
with anything original.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the demiurge
has no originality.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The demiurge is jealous of us
because we have creativity.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And for that, that is
one of the main reasons

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that he is suppressing us
is because of our own innate

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
creativity and Neo
uses that against him

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:90%
and defeats the Matrix.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's what never
had been done by the previous

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
incarnations of Neo-- and
we learned that Neo is one

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of a long line of Neos
that have come and failed--

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is that none of them
figured out that they

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:90%
could give them self up, right?

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So there was this choice
of self-sacrifice.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So free will wins
out in the end,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:84%
precisely because they agreed
to give themselves up and die.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Which, in a way, is what
we all have to do, in a way.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So to fight against
the powers that be,

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:84%
we have to accept that our
death may be the result of that.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's weird about the
movie is the final scene has

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
the Architect and the
Oracle, the Sophia principal,

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
sitting down on a
park bench, you know,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
just kind of chumming it up.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And they've created
this rainbow utopia.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's like Neo had to die
so that they could create

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
another version of the Matrix,
which is just like Happy Land

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Barney or something.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and again, you go back
to the origins of Christianity

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and you have this kind of
Pollyannnish kind of philosophy

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
being spread around Europe
about how love your neighbor,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:90%
what does that really mean?

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And so Christianity
was trying to adopt

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy of the Gnostics
in order to spread itself.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it was an
anti-Gnostic philosophy.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:84%
So it's still interesting
that the Matrix is still

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:90%
going at the end of the movie.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we saw was
Neo basically approaching

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the source of the
Matrix, this giant robot,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and making that deal with him to
destroy the rebel program Agent

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Smith.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.044 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that can be done

00:34:46.044 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:90%
is that Neo gives his life up.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you see him in
that cruciform pose,

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:90%
which is his self-sacrifice.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, the other
Neos all failed.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:84%
He wins, he achieves success
because of his free will choice

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.490 align:middle line:90%
to sacrifice himself.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a re-presentation
of the Christ myth.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and in Gnostic
mythology, of course,

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:84%
light solidifies down onto
the Earth and becomes form.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:10%
So we were originally light,
but we became form, humans

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:10%
or animals or plants.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And in this movie, it's
the exact opposite.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the deification of Neo.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.690 align:middle line:84%
He's taking form and
turning it back into light.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He's returning back
to the source, which

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.340 align:middle line:84%
is what all the entire
Gnostic goal is,

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:90%
is to return back to the light.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:52.884 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.381 align:middle line:90%
>> It is done.

00:35:54.381 --> 00:35:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> In my view, the take away
from "The Matrix" is that,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
on many layers and levels,
we are in a matrix.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Just that simple.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in one sense, we live in
Plato's "Allegory of the Cave"

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
because Plato was talking
about an oppressive state,

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.110 align:middle line:84%
right, that keeps
its citizens down

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and tries to keep them
drugged and stupid

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and it controls him
through base desires,

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.580 align:middle line:84%
like we saw in
"Matrix Reloaded."

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have to exit
that cave that we're in.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the essence
of this whole trilogy

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:84%
is exiting that
cave, they can only

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle line:84%
come through true
philosophy, ultimately.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the true
philosopher, Socrates,

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is the guy who's willing
to stop being transfixed

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
by the phantasms on the
cave wall, exit the cave,

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and then come back and try to
tell people about it but you

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.910 align:middle line:90%
can't do it unless you--

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.856 align:middle line:84%
as Morpheus says, you have to
see the Matrix for yourself.

00:36:53.856 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:90%
You can't just tell people.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to exit for yourself.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> You do.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll point out that
Socrates gave his life for that.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Just like Neo did.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah, I agree with that.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
all of our journey

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to try to break free of
this matrix, all the way

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.765 align:middle line:84%
from what you've been
taught in school to what

00:37:12.765 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:84%
your parents and your religions
were trying to teach you.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
You've been trapped in a
matrix your whole entire life.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Even when you think you're
liberated from the matrix,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.890 align:middle line:84%
you're still living
out the programming

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that the matrix left
embedded in you.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a matrix
and we need to all break

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.920 align:middle line:90%
free of the matrix.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
