>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.220 align:middle line:84%
to the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is Hollywood Decoded.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: We chose the
Star Wars trilogy

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:10%
because, obviously, it's one
of the most important trilogies

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:10%
and film series of all time.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Star Wars-- I think
you can't even

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
put into words how influential
this series has been.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:10%
In many ways, different
than Star Trek, but similar.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:90%
But more of a space opera.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think it appeals for its
basic archetypal principles.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's perennial-- it's the
battle of good and evil.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.992 align:middle line:84%
But it also-- just
like other stories

00:00:47.992 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about,
like The Lord of the Rings--

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
it deals with prophetic
elements, things

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that could warn us
about the future

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and tyrannical governments.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But it also provides a positive
spiritual message, overall.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember the context
of when this movie came out.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
We had just come out
of the Vietnam War.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this was
a very appealing idea.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Lucas was also involved
in Apocalypse Now, which

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
is also a very similar plot.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:10%
And I think that Lucas
is trying to tell us--

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:10%
show us-- that no matter
how powerful you are,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:10%
you can still be defeated by
the lowest of civilizations--

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:10%
similar to Lord of the Rings.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:90%
What Tolkien was telling us.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: What's interesting
about this film, also,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is the relationship--

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:90%
of all the films--

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
is the relationship
that they have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to the works of Joseph Campbell,
and his "Hero's Journey" work.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
Lucas was incredibly influenced
by Joseph Campbell-- even

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:10%
inviting him to
Skywalker Ranch, where

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:10%
they shot a series of
interviews with Bill Moyer right

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:10%
before Joseph Campbell died.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:10%
That's how much Lucas
liked Joseph Campbell

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:10%
and his whole
evocation of the hero,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:10%
and what the hero
has to go through.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you, when you look at
something like Star Wars,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:10%
recognize some of the themes of
the hero throughout mythology?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that George
Lucas was using standard

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:10%
mythological figures.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:10%
The old man as the advisor--

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:10%
well, specifically,
what he made me think of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:10%
is the Japanese swordmaster.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And in
Campbell's work,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
he shows that the
hero is usually--

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have parents.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
There's these certain kinds of
archetypes t that Luke has--

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that the hero has to
have-- in order for him

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to have a successful
hero's journey.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And Luke is definitely the hero.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But the movie, and the
series, is not about Luke.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
As you pointed out to
me in previous talks,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
before we did
this, this series--

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the first series, the first
three of the trilogy--

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.027 align:middle line:90%
are about Darth Vader.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:53.826 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: They are.

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of the reasons
it's a positive message,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:10%
is because it's a
story of redemption,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:10%
that's very unexpected.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The character Darth Vader,
although is completely wicked,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
completely ominous
throughout the series, it's--

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:90%
in a weird twist of Providence--

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.864 align:middle line:84%
the only way that the
empire could be taken down

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is through the character
of Darth Vader.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're going to see when

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.688 align:middle line:90%
we get to Return of the Jedi.

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But to begin with,
in Star Wars--

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that you mentioned
the Joseph Campbell aspect--

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
because Joseph Campbell is
really just a restatement

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.229 align:middle line:90%
of Carl Jung, on many levels.

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to see, here,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.525 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of the
archetypes from Jung,

00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen in
so many other films.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, very popular
in Hollywood, very popular

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:90%
in literature.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a big surprise.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.484 align:middle line:84%
But there's also going to
be a technological warning

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
from this series,
and there's also

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be statements about
politics and social order,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as esoteric,
hermetic concepts.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going to have
warnings about transhumanism.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The Death Star is,
obviously, I think,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
an analogy for the
military-industrial complex--

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
for the machine of
war, that we've heard

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in other shows.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that it-- again,
it functions on so many levels.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
But because it's such
a basic space opera,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that's why it has
such a wide appeal.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great message.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:90%
It's one of the best--

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, one of the
best films ever made.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I like the whole idea
of the way that Lucas

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
brought in, you know,
the spiritual concepts

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Force.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And that there is
this ether around us.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
In hermetic-- in
hermeticism, they

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
believe that the element
that is surrounding us

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:90%
is not just empty space.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It's an ether.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And that you can
manipulate that ether.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We do manipulate that ether--
with language, for instance.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Using words, we're
pushing the ether

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:90%
around the space between us.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And Lucas is showing
that, with your mind--

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:84%
a well-disciplined mind-- you
can achieve amazing things

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is essentially
a spiritual idea.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from the east.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And Lucas must
have been studying,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
not just Joseph Campbell, but
it looks like Zen Buddhism,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and Taoist practices.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And taking those,
and incorporating them in.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Campbell was the one
that said, hey, you know,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:90%
George--

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:90%
go do this.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Then, you know-- kudos to him.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
brilliant idea to bring

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
in these eastern things.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:84%
Just like in The Lord of the
Rings, we're going to have,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
on the one level, a kind
of political warning.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be based on
the transition of the old Roman

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
republic, out of a republican
form of government,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:84%
into an imperial
form of government.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Which, we all know about
"crossing the rubicon."

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
That's where that
phrase comes from,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.294 align:middle line:84%
where they move out
of the old republic

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and into the new order--
which is a tyrannical empire.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And for our day, the reason that
that is relevant is that Lucas

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
himself has said, in interviews,
back when the prequels came

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.943 align:middle line:84%
out-- even though we're not
talking about the prequels--

00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
he did admit that it
did deal with 9/11,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and the post-9/11 world.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's very much a warning.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the old films
are a warning, too.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's this machine of war,
it's this transhumanist tech

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:90%
domination-- this control grid--

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.477 align:middle line:90%
that he's warning us about.

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
first clip, which

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to show that--
that this station is now

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.259 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate power
in the universe.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Any attack made by the rebels
against the station would be

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
a useless gesture, no
matter what technical data

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
they've obtained.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:10%
This station is now the
ultimate power in the universe.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:10%
I suggest we use it.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't be too proud of
this technological terror

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:10%
you've constructed.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The ability to destroy a
planet is insignificant next

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
to the power of the Force.

>> Don't try to frighten us
with your sorcerer's ways,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:10%
Lord Vader.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:10%
Your sad devotion to
that ancient religion

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:10%
has not helped you conjure
up the stolen data tapes,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:10%
or given you clairvoyance
enough to find the rebels

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.528 align:middle line:10%
hidden fortress--

00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:10%
[CHOKING SOUNDS]

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:10%
>> I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's interesting that
most of the guys in the room,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
there-- the board room of the
empire, on the Death Star--

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
except for that guy--

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they speak-- they
have a British accent.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a nod to the
British empire, the collapse

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of the British imperial system,
as well, going on, here.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is,
this was around the time

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that Immanuel Velikovsky
was putting out

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of works that
were theorizing

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:90%
what he called catastrophism.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
That the reason that
we look out and we

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.909 align:middle line:84%
see all of this barrenness
on the other planets

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and moons is that there
might have actually

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
been some kind of giant
catastrophe or battle,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.807 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, of some kind.

00:07:31.807 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting thesis,
and I think, maybe,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.223 align:middle line:84%
that might have been
in the background

00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:38.322 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of a giant weapon
that can destroy whole planets.

00:07:38.322 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Well, that's
very interesting,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
because it seems rather
dubious that Lucas

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
could have known about the
exploding planet theory.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it really didn't come
into fruition until a year

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:90%
before Star Wars came out.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:10%
The first movie
came out in 1977,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:10%
and 1976 is when Tom Van
Flandern wrote his book

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:10%
about the exploding planet--

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:10%
theorizing that
the asteroid belt

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:10%
was the remnants
of a planet that

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:10%
existed between
Mars and Jupiter,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:10%
and somehow it exploded.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting is, if you

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
go look at pictures
of Mars, or the moon,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
it could be argued that a lot
of the things that you see--

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:90%
especially on the moon--

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
are some kind of
remnants from a war that

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
happened a long time ago.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Streaks, and weird craters,
and all sorts of things

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Hoagland
talks about, in his work.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was friends
with Tom Van Flandern.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that Van
Flandern, near the end,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.760 align:middle line:84%
was also beginning to believe
that, possibly, this exploding

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
planet was caused by people,
and not by a natural event.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.946 align:middle line:84%
And to have Lucas show us
this in 1977 is amazing.

00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: One things that's
funny about this scene is

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.486 align:middle line:84%
that Darth Vader,
himself, is kind

00:08:50.486 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of the embodiment of a
warning of transhumanism--

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and even he recognizes that
this technological power is not

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate force
in the universe.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's a bad
guy, and even he still

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that there's a
metaphysical, transcendent

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
power that's above this-- the
Force that we talked about.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.239 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that there's
so much that we don't know,

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're absolutely
right to bring

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
in these topics of the
possibility of paleophysics.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joseph P. Farrell
has an excellent series

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:90%
of books on that topic.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Joseph Farrell,
actually, in The Giza Death

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Star series, he
postulates that they

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
use the pyramid to create
a vibrational force that

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:90%
actually blew the planet apart.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's an Oxford-educated
guy, so you have

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:90%
to take what he says seriously.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about this
clip that we just saw,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that I think is
interesting, is the guy

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is mocking Darth Vader's
religion of the Force,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:84%
saying, it didn't help
us, what good is it?

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And Darth responds
by choking the guy

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
with his magical powers.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, Darth Vader

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is always choking people,
throughout the entire series--

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:84%
sometimes with his hand,
sometimes with the force.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But what he's doing
is he's chopping off

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:90%
your ability to speak.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that magic
is associated with spell,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and spells associated
with words.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And what he's doing
is he's making sure

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that all vocalizations
stop, and only his reality

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:90%
is the one that's let in.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're sort
of using the force

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to stop any opponent
from speaking.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that stands out, here,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we all have fears,
hopes, desires, and so forth--

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
dreams--

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that manifest in a kind of
inner world of symbolism.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
This is what Carl Jung really
plumbed the depths of--

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
the inner world of the psyche.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.182 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
Lucas looked to Campbell

00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
was because Campbell knew
about all these archetypes,

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to put
those powerful archetypes

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:90%
into his space opera.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So what's great
about this next scene

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
is that we have this battle--

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned, Luke
doesn't have an identity.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.174 align:middle line:90%
He's lacking his father.

00:10:56.174 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know
who his father is.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:90%
He's an orphan.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.059 align:middle line:84%
This is the Achilles heel
of many of the heroes.

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So what Luke's going to
have to do is face up to,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:84%
not just the fear of not
knowing who his father is,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.559 align:middle line:84%
but what if my father
is not a good guy?

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
What if he's a-- how do
I know that I'm not going

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
to turn out like my father?

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:90%
So this is his greatest fear.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And he's not mature enough,
yet, to realize that it's not

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
a physical confrontation.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual,
psychological battle.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Yoda prepares him for
this psyops test--

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:90%
which, that's what it is.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, like the
hero mythology, he's

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do his
Katabasis-- his descent

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld to face
his primal, subconscious fears.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Am I my dad?

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Is my dad evil?

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Or am I going to
turn out like him?

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.991 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to see in this great scene.

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
This is from The
Empire Strikes Back,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.119 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's actually
kind of the crux scene

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:48.035 align:middle line:90%
of the entire trilogy.

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:48.835 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:11:48.835 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:90%
In many ways.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.325 align:middle line:90%
[OMINOUS MUSIC]

00:11:53.325 --> 00:11:54.802 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.802 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So what we
have, here, is--

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:10%
as we said-- every
hero has to descend

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:10%
to the underworld and
basically either face death,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:10%
or some manifestation
of his greatest fear.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.950 align:middle line:10%
And in Luke's case,
it's, as we said--

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:10%
am I my father?

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Am I going to be my father?

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
he has this intuition--

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't know yet, but
he has this intuition--

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Darth Vader is my daddy.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Right?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So Darth Vader is a
baby-daddy, right now.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.546 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Who's your daddy?

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But that's
the great challenge,

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the temptation that
Luke's going to be

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.584 align:middle line:90%
tempted with the dark side.

00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And Yoda even says
that place, that cave,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.616 align:middle line:84%
is strong with the
dark side of the force.

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost
like the dark side

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
is kind of tempting,
manipulating, leading Luke

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:90%
down this path.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see that Edenic
imagery of the serpent, there.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The temptation of the
serpent in Genesis.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And then Luke actually
fails this test.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:10%
And this is why, I
think, a lot of people--

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:10%
a lot of critics--

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:10%
believe that Empire Strikes Back
is the best of this trilogy.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It's precisely because
Luke is not a perfect hero.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:10%
He has the Achilles' heel.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:10%
He fails this test.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:10%
Yoda, later, says, remember
your failure at the cave.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:10%
If you try to go fix
things in a quick way,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:10%
that's the easy path.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:10%
That's going to lead you
down the left-hand path

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:10%
of the dark side.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.945 align:middle line:10%
Which, in hermeticism,
right, the left-handed path--

00:13:13.945 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:10%
that's the dark side.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:30.904 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.904 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: That
was the part where

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
he finds out who he really is.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in the end, we
have to say that Lucas is really

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to present, not just
good and evil, and the battle

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:90%
thereof--

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
but kind of a battle
of archetypes.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And Luke is not the hero
of this movie, essentially.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It's Darth Vader who's the hero.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that finally kills
the emperor, and saves the day.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the movie is this
delicious kind of manipulation

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
of Darth Vader,
towards this final end.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And when he does realize
that transhumanism,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and his own transhumanism,
is not the way to go,

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and he destroys the Death Star.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting, also, about
Lucas, is his use of words.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
For instance, "Luke Skywalker"
is a play on George Lucas.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
George is a Greek word
that means "earth walker."

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And Lucas is, of course, Luke.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So earthwalker Lucas is
actually Luke Skywalker.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And Darth Vader-- if you say it
phonetically, Darth "vah-der"--

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:84%
it sounds a lot
like "dark father."

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So he's kind of
signaling to you,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
from the start, that there's
something going on, here.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Han
Solo is interesting,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because he's the
independent guy.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:90%
He's the solo.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And all through this,
Yoda is-- of course,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the 10th letter in the
Hebrew alphabet is yod.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So Lucas is very,
very much aware

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of these kind of
metaphysical concepts,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and he's packing
them into the film.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I do want to talk more
about the hermeticism

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Kabbalistic
element in Star Wars.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But I want to show
this clip, first,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.350 align:middle line:90%
because it illustrates that.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at "always, with
you, what cannot be done."

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
We'll never get it out, now.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.347 align:middle line:90%
>> So certain, are you?

00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:18.966 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:24.892 align:middle line:10%
[SIGHS] Always, with
you, what cannot be done.

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:27.295 align:middle line:90%
Hear you nothing that I say?

00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Master, moving stones
around is one thing.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.415 align:middle line:90%
But this is totally different.

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:32.215 align:middle line:90%
>> No!

00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:90%
No different!

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Only different in your mind.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.235 align:middle line:84%
You must unlearn what
you have learned.

00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it a try.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No!

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Try not.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:10%
Do, or do not.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:90%
There is no try.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.299 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Is this when he
successfully pulls it out?

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:53.098 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:15:53.098 --> 00:15:53.914 align:middle line:90%
Well, he gets it--

00:15:53.914 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Halfway up.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.407 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --halfway up, and
then it kind of drops back in.

00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then Yoda does it, right,
and shows him that, look--

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.889 align:middle line:90%
it's all in your mind.

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about the
Kabbalistic element, here.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Because yod-- this
is fascinating.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a coded
reference to Kabbalism

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It represents, in a way,
both the name of God,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and Israel in the
biblical, Kabbalistic text.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So, like, in Genesis I,
you have 10 commands that

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%
are given at the beginning.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:84%
God says, let there
be, let there be.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on, you
have, in a literary reading

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, a kind
of recapitulation

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.836 align:middle line:84%
of a new creation
at Mount Sinai,

00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
where Israel's
gathered together,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
giving of the law--

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
10 commands.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Yod is the 10th letter
of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at gematria, which

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of assigning
numerical values

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to the letters, you
get a 1 and a 0.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And, in that way, I think,
we're looking at the 1,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
which is the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet--

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
which is aleph.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:10%
Then if you think about
10, this is intimately

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:10%
connected to creation.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, later,
to God's people--

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Israel.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So Yoda, in many ways, I think,
encapsulates and represents

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the good side-- the good people,
God's people, and so forth.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:84%
They're always presented
that way in the trilogy.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that Lucas is directly

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:90%
drawing on Kabbalistic imagery.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
rebellion is successful--

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
because they're actually
standing up for what's true,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
for these metaphysical,
transcendent principles.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
And Yoda makes that fascinating
statement, at one point,

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:90%
to Luke.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
Luke says, is the
dark side stronger?

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.191 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
Luke's going to be tempted.

00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
He's turning over in his head--
maybe I'm on the wrong side,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And Yoda says, no.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just quicker,
faster, maybe more sexy.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't achieve
what it seeks to achieve.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.105 align:middle line:84%
It's self-destructive,
ultimately.

00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's one of
the most powerful messages

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:90%
of this film.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And Darth Vader is
the exemplar of that.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Darth Vader is self-destructive.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
He chose the dark
side of the path--

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Force-- but in the end,
as we see, in a twist of fate,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.521 align:middle line:84%
he's the only one that
could've saved the rebellion,

00:17:58.521 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and destroy the Emperor.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else was strong enough
to destroy the Emperor.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And this is
this Kabbalah thing is also

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
exemplified in the end of
both Episode IV, The New

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Hope, and Return of the Jedi.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
When they're destroying
the Death Star,

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
they have to find this certain
path that gets them to it.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like going
up the central channel

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.084 align:middle line:90%
of the Kabbalah.

00:18:23.084 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
have-- and the only way

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
you can get to enlightenment
is to go up that central path.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
The dark side is going
up around all the Sefirot

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in the Tree of Life.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Aleister Crowley, of course,
had the serpent's path,

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
which was this kind of
varied way to get to the top.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And the enlightened
Jewish rabbis

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
would tell you, no, no, no--

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:90%
go straight up the path.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that,
even in the movie 2001,

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it has the Kabbalah
embedded in it.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Kabbalah is embedded
in the Star Wars trilogy,

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:90%
over and over.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But the victory that Luke
has, when he finally blows up

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
the Death Star, is him
traveling up the central channel

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
until he gets to Keter,
and then he's successful.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.667 align:middle line:10%
So that is his moment
of enlightenment.

00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Interesting.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: It's also,
I think, emblematic

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:10%
in the symbol of the Empire.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The Empire's symbol is a
hexagonal cube, kind of turned

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.072 align:middle line:90%
on its point.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, as
we all know, is Saturn.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The Empire represents that
control, that dominance,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:90%
that sacrificial aspect.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
The Empire has no problem
sacrificing a whole planet.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It has no problem
utilizing terror.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
At one point, the storm troopers
actually stage a false flag,

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and try to blame it
on the sand people.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And Obi-wan explains
that to Luke.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
He says, "we were
meant to think this

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:90%
was done by storm troopers."

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.931 align:middle line:90%
Or, by the Jawas.

00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
This was actually the
Stormtroopers, that did it.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.187 align:middle line:84%
So again, another
Kabbalistic image, there.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, they're
using all the things

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned-- but
they're also using magic.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
important to understand.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And the magic is
represented by the logo

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Empire, this hex.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And what you do with--

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:90%
you throw a hex on someone.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And that would be using the
Force in a negative way.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And what a hex is--

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:90%
it's like a box.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.277 align:middle line:90%
It binds you.

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: A cube that
binds whoever you're hexing.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's
associated with Saturn.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Because Saturn, they
believed, in the ancient days,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
was the furthermost
out planet, which

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
encapsulated our solar system in
a cube kind of configuration--

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
"the cube of space,"
they called it.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And Lucas is definitely drawing
a parallel between the hexing

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and the magic--

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:90%
the bad use of magic.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Father Time--
Chronos, death--

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Death Star.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's always got
the scythe, the sickle.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- the very emblem
of the Empire is Saturn.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It is Saturnian.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And,
strangely enough,

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
the Death Star has a very
close resemblance to the moon

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:90%
of Saturn, Iapetus--

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
including the little hole
in the side, and everything.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But there are
these relationships

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
between Saturn and Star Wars
that are very interesting.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip, we
see that Luke is slowly

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
becoming a machine, too.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's becoming like
his father, Darth Vader--

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
he's going to be turning
slowly into a machine,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:90%
unless he stops himself.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he gets his hand
cut off by Darth Vader.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's getting
a mechanical hand,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and becoming, slowly, a machine.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So this is
interesting, because we

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
saw in the cave, when he was
tempted and when he failed,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%
it was because he wasn't
prepared to face up to the fact

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that Darth Vader
might be his father.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I might turn into Darth Vader.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
The guy who is more machine
that man, is said about him.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:84%
We have this warning of
technological dominance,

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
transhumanism-- is this
a bad path to go down?

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when we
become more machine than man

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:90%
is that we lose our free will.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:90%
We lose freedom.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.004 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the empire is
all about-- tech dominance,

00:21:54.004 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:90%
and no freedom.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't want freedom for
the various races and planets.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we should also
consider the symbolic aspects

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:90%
of the hand.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, Manley P.
Hall, in his Secret Teaching

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of All Ages, has a whole
section dedicated just

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%
to the symbolism of the hand.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:10%
And he talks about
how it, itself,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:10%
is the five appendages
of humanity.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We think about the
famous Leonardo da Vinci

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:90%
image of the Vitruvian Man.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's emblematic of
human nature, itself.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, for Luke
to lose his hand,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and to have it replaced
with something mechanical,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
is, itself, I think, a
warning of transhumanism.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that
we have a 10-base counting

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.134 align:middle line:84%
Which is also a 5-base
counting system.

00:22:42.134 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Five is, of course,
the number of life--

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
like the Vitruvian
Man by da Vinci.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you do
the square root of 5,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
You get the phi ratio series.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So this all is about life.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And 5 and 10 are all numbers
that equate with life.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Yoda, being yod--

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
the 10th digit in the Hebrew
alphabet-- is proof of this.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And the replacement
of it with synthetics.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.395 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mm-hmm.

00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.081 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in this next
clip, what's interesting,

00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
see, is that we can't

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
underestimate the dark side.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
This is something that Yoda
keeps warning Luke about.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't underestimate it.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:90%
It's more clever than you think.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It may not be as powerful
as the good side,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:90%
but it's still very clever.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Emperor divulges
that this was all a plot.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He led the rebels to
where they are, on Endor,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to be destroyed, ultimately.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So Luke is put in this
position where it appears

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.987 align:middle line:90%
there's absolutely no hope.

00:23:37.987 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
he can fall back on

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility,
the slight chance,

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that there's still
humanity, there's still

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:90%

That's his one, last hope.

>>DYER: It's a simple message,
but it's a powerful message,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
because it's perennial.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the fact that sacrifice--

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
love-- is ultimately what
can overcome any darkness.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the message
of the entire trilogy.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a very good message,
and I think that everybody--

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the reasons why this
series was so popular, really.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately,
what we have is

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
a platonic, Gnostic
conception, here.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Because when any of the
Jedi die, or pass on,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
they leave their
temporal, physical body.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:90%
They sort of vaporize.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And you think they
might be dead.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But no-- they actually appear
as these blue, translucent

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:90%
spirits.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So the film is
presenting an afterlife.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And it presents, actually,
the redemption of Darth Vader.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've argued for a long time
that the whole trilogy, really,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is about the redemption
of Darth Vader.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:84%
It's that even if we're
mired in wickedness,

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.752 align:middle line:84%
we're mired in evil,
it's not too late.

00:27:30.752 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:90%
There's still good within us.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.335 align:middle line:84%
There's still
humanity within us.

00:27:33.335 --> 00:27:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We can still reconnect with that
transcendent source and power

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:90%
that created us.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I like the idea
that when Obi-wan dies,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
he becomes a helper
in the afterlife.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Which is a very Gnostic
idea-- that the spirit

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
can go on, and help people
that have been left behind.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: My takeaway
from this is not just

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that it's a popular space
opera, and it's fun to watch,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and I grew up with this,
but that it actually

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:84%
speaks to perennial
problems of mankind.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
To universal
philosophical questions.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
To good and evil.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And it does it in a way
that, on the one hand,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is appealing to children, but
it's also very sophisticated.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:90%
It's very adult, in many ways.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how evil, no
matter how wicked we are,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
what this series tells
us is that evil--

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
domination, dominating
other people

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
by your willpower--
that's actually a ruse.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a trick.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It's encapsulating
what Yoda tells Luke--

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's quicker,
faster way, perhaps,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to a limited span of
power, but ultimately it

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get you anything, and it
ends in your self-destruction.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And what makes people
go on in the afterlife,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
live on into eternity--
the good guys--

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep, mythological opus,
disguised as a science fiction

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:90%
space opera for kids.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why adults liked it--
because they could see and feel

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
deeper going on,

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:84%
in this so-called children's
show, that was happening.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why it
is so successful-- because

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.129 align:middle line:84%
of that deeper
meaning that it has.
