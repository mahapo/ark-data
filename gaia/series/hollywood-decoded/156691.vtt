>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.820 align:middle line:84%
behind the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.301 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Hollywood Decoded."

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:16.247 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So we chose these two
movies, "The Last Mimzy"

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and "9," because
they both came out

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:90%
around the same time period.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:10%
They're both ostensibly
children's films--

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:10%
although I don't
think they really are.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:10%
And finally, they have
very similar plots.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
In "The Last Mimzy,"
the scientist

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
sends an object into the past
to save his world, his dystopian

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And in "9," the scientist
sends something into the future

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
to save his dystopian world.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, both movies are
very similar, but one,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I think "9" is a little more
deeper than "The Last Mimzy,"

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
but I think "The Last Mimzy"
still is important enough

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.756 align:middle line:84%
for us to make at least
a brief comment on it.

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, I
think that you're

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.463 align:middle line:90%
right that they're very similar.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
They both have the same
patterns, the same themes.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at reality
from a Platonic, Pythagorean

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and almost, at times, Gnostic.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Especially with
"9," we get the idea

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
of the original creator being,
again, this one, this monad,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:90%
this unifying source.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's a
human being who creates,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and then these entities
that are mechanical

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
are lacking their soul.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, in
"The Last Mimzy,"

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
you have human beings
that are warned

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.007 align:middle line:84%
about an ecological
disaster in the near future.

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
have to do is, again,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.732 align:middle line:84%
find their soul to avoid a
toxic and transhumanist future.

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
If you noticed, at the
end of "The Last Mimzy,"

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
everybody's having to wear
these exoskeleton suits

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
that protect them from a toxic
environment due to contaminated

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
DNA.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So both stories are
apocalyptic, basically.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But they also present
hope and, again,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
the avoidance of the
apocalypse through, again,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
operating in wisdom.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
We are so focused on
knowledge in our era,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and collecting facts
and data, but it really

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
doesn't aid us unless
we are wise in the way

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.691 align:middle line:90%
that we use this data.

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is taking knowledge
and then combining it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:90%
into a newer form.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I think that
there's both Buddhist concepts,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic concepts,
Pythagorean concepts,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry concepts,
and this kind of--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
like the grandfather
paradox of time,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.177 align:middle line:84%
having to go back to get DNA
to save the future, which

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:90%
is what the movie's about.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right, right.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So
these two kids find

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
this rabbit on the beach up
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And this rabbit, we later
discover, has deep circuitry.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.781 align:middle line:90%
It's an AI, it's a form of AI.

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And these kids
discover it, and they

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
begin getting superpowers from
this stuffed rabbit, which

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
is Mimzy.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the boy, Noah,
and the girl, Emma,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
who are brother
and sister, begin

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:90%
taking on these superpowers.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, Noah begins
drawing Sri Yantras

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and other sacred
geometrical forms,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.189 align:middle line:84%
and he really doesn't
understand what he's doing

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:84%
or where it's coming
from, but it's clearly

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
coming from the last
Mimzy, this stuffed rabbit.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
becomes a genius because

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
of his interactions with it.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then he designs
the machine that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
will send the DNA
into the future, which

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
was the whole point of the
experiment throughout the film.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The scientist who made
the last Mimzy wanted

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
some pure, innocent
people to find it--

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: --capture
that DNA, and then

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:90%
send it into the future.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Yeah, it's based
on the Adam and Eve myth.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And so you've got
Adam and Eve, and then

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:10%
regular humanity that
expand from them.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we need a new
Adam and a new Eve.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the two,
brother and sister,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
are actually going to
function in that capacity.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Noah's going to be, in a
way, like Noah from Genesis

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:90%
8, the Noah's ark story.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:90%
He's going to be the engineer.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
He's going to help his sister,
who is the feminine archetype.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:90%
She's more intuitive.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.500 align:middle line:84%
She has these separate
powers from him.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
He has certain powers,
like telekinesis,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:90%
and he can open these portals.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:10%
And what's interesting
is that it's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:10%
done through the
idea of the yantra,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:10%
an Ancient Indian philosophy.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the idea that certain
forms, geometrical forms,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
can actually tap
into other planes.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And it also connects to
vibrations and sounds,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
which is why he has the ability
to speak to bugs and insects,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and move them around.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's all done
through vocal intonation.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So what Noah does is tap
into higher frequencies.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it is true
that these different levels

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of reality that we
experience, they

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
do happen at different
vibrations or frequencies.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that aspect
of the movie I

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
found interesting,
very fascinating.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Me too.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So what's going
on here is the pooling

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of both the rational, and
scientific, analytical left

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
brain in the character of
Noah in his engineering.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the more intuitive,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:84%
the right brain, the
creativity on the part of Emma.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And so she's functioning
like a new Eve,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%
a new mother of humanity.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.278 align:middle line:84%
That's what her role is going
to be at the end of the film.

00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
She's described as the new Eve,
the new mother of the world.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:90%
He's the new Adam, in a way.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So I like that we have this
balance between the right brain

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and the left brain, between
analytical and intuitive,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
creative thinking.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most positive
aspect to this film, I think,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
is that when they're
faced with the raid

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
by Homeland Security,
and these different FBI

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
agents, and whatnot,
they don't understand

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that there are people that are
gifted, there are people that

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
are geniuses, indigo
children, that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
are way ahead of
this sort of base,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
or governmental
control type thinking.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I like that
aspect of the film,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.649 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
giving credence to--

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
the only way that we're
going to move ahead

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world, progress
truly, is by listening

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to these spiritually
gifted people.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: These
archetypes are also

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the teacher
and his girlfriend, who

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:90%
discover Emma and Noah.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:90%
He's a science teacher.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
He's a rational.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%
She's a Buddhist.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:90%
She meditates.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Good point.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
she understands it

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
before he understands it,
because she understands the Sri

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Yantra and what it really means.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And he just is familiar
with the imagery.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
He's not familiar with the
intrinsic symbology of the Sri

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Yantra, but she is.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they go to try
to tell their parents

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
about their gifted kids.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
parents rejected them

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and say it's not true.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: As an example
of that, let's look

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
at the clip, "How did
you do that, Noah?"

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:10%
We have this idea in
ancient Platonism--

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:10%
the fundamental fabric
and structure of reality

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:10%
is actually psyche
or ideal forms.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And so it does have a pattern.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It does have a structure.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
seeing in this image

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.915 align:middle line:84%
is the interconnectedness of
all these forms, these objects.

00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be
separate, but they actually

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.748 align:middle line:84%
have an underlying
structure that unifies them.

00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening is that
he's tapping into that unity.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's able to, by
thought, move this object

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
to another location.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.159 align:middle line:84%
And so really, time and
space are, in the film,

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:90%
presented as somewhat relative.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:56.895 align:middle line:84%
They're really relative to our

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in Indian
philosophy, you

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
have this idea of
the yantra, which

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual technology.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It's revelatory of deeper
metaphysical truths,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.522 align:middle line:84%
So what we have is that
there's a conceptual loom.

00:08:29.522 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm talking about
the forms or the underlying

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
structure, there's
a relationship

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.694 align:middle line:84%
between all objects, and
it's mapped out, in a way.

00:08:37.694 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
As we're going to see when we
talk about "9," for example,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:90%
the works of Paracelsus.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:10%
He talks about a matrix.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:10%
He's writing this
back in the 1500s.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:10%
And he says that all reality
is connected and birthed out

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:10%
of this primal matrix.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, I think
Ancient Indian philosophy had

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
some prototypical
notion of this,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that all objects can,
therefore, be accessed,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
or their essence is tapped into,
by these different frequencies.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
Tesla tapped into.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
This is how he figured out
that certain notes could

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:90%
break glass.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So that that
frequency is actually

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.487 align:middle line:84%
disrupting the molecules
in the structure of glass.

00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that all of
these ideas are connected.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And it all goes
back to what we've

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
seen in ancient philosophy,
ancient religion,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
the idea of everything
being connected

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:90%
in this metaphysical sense.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%

of Hans Jenny in cymatics

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that we can make geometric
forms using frequencies.

And they learn the
sacred geometry in this

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:84%
from their dream state,
which is interesting.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Like in Ancient
Indian philosophy,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the waking state is just as
important as the dream state.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So the outer world is what you
experience in the waking state.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
The inner world is
the dream state.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And in both, what
connects the two,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
according to Carl Jung and even
the physicist Wolfgang Pauli,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:90%
is archetypes.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%

what saves humanity,

as this savior figure

by her tear going
into the future,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, returning
some pure genetic lineage.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think, a
prescient warning.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
ways that we can possibly

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:84%
assess this film, that
genetic modification can

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:90%
be a serious danger.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:84%

of releasing GMO salmon

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%

>>WEIDNER: No, we don't.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: We're actually
doing this stuff.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need
to pay attention

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:90%
to these kinds of warnings.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.854 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and there
is, of course, early on,

00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the scene where the science
professor is showing

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
the kids the two-headed snake.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: It's the hydra.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
The hydra is this
mutant reptile.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.362 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
very indicative of what

00:15:07.362 --> 00:15:08.820 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
say in this movie

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
about genetic modification.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And the plot of the movie
is that the dystopian future

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
has been created by
genetic modification.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.559 align:middle line:84%
Our precious quality

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%

>>WEIDNER: Well, that really
shows the Adam and Eve

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
theme there.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to the
great German idealist

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
philosopher, Hegel, one
of his important concepts

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:90%
is alienation.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here
is the alienation

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
of not just humans
amongst one another,

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
but alienation from
man and nature.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.879 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That was a
fundamental concept for Hegel

00:16:27.879 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:84%
because he felt that modernity
was moving towards alienation,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:90%
principally through technology.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That technology
would have that force

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.752 align:middle line:90%
of alienating us and nature.

00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's been proven
right about that, whatever one

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%
thinks of Hegel's philosophy.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And here, what we're
seeing is humans

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that actually have taken on
non-human characteristics.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:90%
They look like bugs.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:90%
They look alien.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
They're basically wearing
transhumanist exoskeletons

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to even survive in
their environment.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
presumably, they

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
can't have natural
intercourse or interrelations.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
the restoration

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
of the genetic lineage, they're
able to shed these bugs suits.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And we move back
towards an Edenic state.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, I think
we've been constantly talking

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
about these themes
through this series,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
about the natural
state as opposed

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.096 align:middle line:90%
to the transhumanist state.

00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of these movies

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
are warning us about
the transhumanism,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and that going back into nature,
like "Avatar," like the people

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
in the future in this
film, where they're

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
living in a natural
state, I think

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly the message.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, it has an
"X-Men" type message too,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much in human
potentiality that the question

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.704 align:middle line:84%
is really, how are
we going to use it?

00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not whether we
can do these things,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
whether we can develop
these abilities,

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:90%
but will it be used wisely?

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the key question

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:90%
as to how to avert destruction.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is really a
combination of science,

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and mythos, and symbol.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And I
think that alchemy

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
is, in some ways, the opposite
of the hard tech future,

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
even though they both
seem to be heading

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:90%
towards the same direction.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Hard tech is trying
to make us immortal.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy promises to
make you immortal.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the next film
that we're talking about,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:84%
"9," this really
is a combination

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.295 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy and science.

00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Brilliantly,
I think, presented.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
A very, very much
underrated movie.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I think "9" is one of the
more interesting movies

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of the early 2000s.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And so "9" is a
story of another,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
again, dystopian future where
the world has been taken over

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:90%
by transhumanism and machines.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: An AI has been
invented by a scientist

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and has gotten out of control.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he knows that he screwed up,
so he invents nine golem-like

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:90%
creatures that he sends--

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that go into the
future after he dies

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to save the world from the
machine intelligence that

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:90%
has taken over the world.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.471 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a very sophisticated
allegory, which we don't often

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:90%
see in children's movies.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty, most of
the time, on the surface

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:90%
what the movie's about.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's a very,
very esoteric allegory,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:84%
influenced by Gnosticism,
influenced by Platonism,

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and influenced by
Paracelsus, who I've never

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
seen Paracelsus
referenced in a movie

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
before, especially
not a kids' movie.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But it actually spurred
me on to go and read

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:90%
the works of Paracelsus.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big key to
understanding this film.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to
the esoteric stuff,

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
we want to look at the
AI control mechanism that

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.109 align:middle line:90%
has taken over the planet.

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
depopulated, right?

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:90%
The humans are gone.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.545 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's only,
as you mentioned,

00:19:48.545 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
these golem-like creatures
who are missing their soul.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And so just like
the Gnostic myths,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
the message of this
movie is the regaining

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.664 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, that
inner quality that's

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%

to create the utopia
that it promises.

And this is really
a message that

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:10%
we've seen throughout history,

>>DYER: A lot of
the modern writers,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:84%
like Bertrand Russell,
HG Wells, they really

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
thought that we could
create this tech-run utopia,

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think that
it's going to work.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
one great warning here

>>WEIDNER: That's
very interesting,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
because in the early 1970s,
Zbigniew Brzezinski and David

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Rockefeller created something
called the Trilateral

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Commission.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And what the
Trilateral Commission

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:84%
was doing, what it tried to
do, and is still trying to do,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
was do an end to
run-around politics

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:84%

what they are making.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.428 align:middle line:84%
They could be making
something that we're

00:22:48.428 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
seeing right here in this film,
an out-of-control AI system,

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:90%

>>DYER: Right.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The film explicitly, as we
said, references Paracelsus.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's important because he
wasn't just a Hermetic doctor

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and philosopher.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
He also formulated his medicinal
and metaphysical theories

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:90%
based on ancient Platonic views.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And what that
led him to theorize

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:84%
was that the world is
actually birthed out

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:90%
of some sort of primal matrix.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.604 align:middle line:84%
And he uses that
term in his credo.

00:23:18.604 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I went
and read Paracelsus.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I was blown away
because that refers

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
not just to living
creatures, but it also

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
refers to the ideas that
would be behind computers.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So Leibniz and Paracelsus
would actually be instrumental

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
in the formation of
the computer over time,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's all based on
Platonism and Pythagorean.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's at once a
healthy, healing message

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of Paracelsus.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:84%
The misuse of it
can then also be

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
turned into this
creation of the tech,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately, the golem.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you said,
these creatures,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
which are aspects of the
original creator's psyche,

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
he says that he endowed
each of these entities

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:90%
with some aspect of his being.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:90%
There's nine of them.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
This goes right back
to Egypt, the Ennead,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
which is the nine principal gods
of Egypt, and then the 10th,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the tetractys that
Pythagoras talked about.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
regaining the soul.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The dominance of tech and AI
means the loss of the soul.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So the creatures are
on their mystical quest

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:90%
to regain their soul.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, and
Gurdjieff also broke the soul

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:90%
into nine aspects.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
interesting also

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
because the aspects are
the archetypes that we've

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
been talking about in
all these other shows.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:90%
We have the leader.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.032 align:middle line:90%
We've got the warrior.

00:24:35.032 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got the people that
are just watching the world

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and taking it in.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And we've got our hero.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, just like
in "Lord of the Rings,"

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the smaller, little figures are
the ones that save the world

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:90%
from the gigantic machines.

episodes we've done,

00:24:53.436 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:84%
the answer to our problems
is found in the past,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
in these ancient myths,
these ancient allegories,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
these ancient stories,
religions, philosophies.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They have a common
underlying theme

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and pattern that leads us
back to some beginning,

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%

from which we were made

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:90%
in the image of some creator.

idea of this original creator

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in the story being an
entity or a human who

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
endues these golems with nine
different aspects of his psyche

or his mind.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a very
fascinating psychology here,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.170 align:middle line:84%
which, again, is based on
the writings of Paracelsus.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%

Latin, it was written

to transmute life,

to create life, and
so forth, in some way.

But here, as we've seen,
it's all been lost.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.299 align:middle line:90%
The soul has been lost.

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
important aspect here,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:84%
is that even if we were
to create some being,

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
it's still inferior to who we
are because we have the will,

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:84%
we have volition,
we have a spirit.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And these beings don't
have spirit until the end.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
They do eventually recover
their divine spark,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:90%

through hard technology.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it looks like he
has to resort to alchemy

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
to solve the original problem.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.800 align:middle line:10%
So he creates the
problem of runaway AI,

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:10%
and then he goes to
Paracelsus to figure out

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:10%
how to create the golems
that he can send out

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:19.290 align:middle line:10%
into the world to save the world
from the AI that he invented.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%

dark science, the black arts,

to make the technology.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
side, he's using alchemy

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:90%
to solve the original problem.

What we're going to see
is that the AI is directly

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
from the left brain
and analytical side.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's even
mentioned that this

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.580 align:middle line:90%
was born of his intellect.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it's lacking
heart, it's lacking soul.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
point of the movie.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
key to this scene.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
"Machine was born
purely of my intellect."

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:10%
- Greetings, 9.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:10%
It had such promise,
my great machine.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:10%
It was meant to be an instrument
of progress, of creation.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:10%
That was the agreement our
chancellor failed to honor.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:21.180 align:middle line:10%
Though the fault is
hardly his alone to bear.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:10%
The machine was born purely
of my intellect, which I now

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:10%
know was not enough.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:10%
My creation was hopelessly
flawed and indeed dangerous,

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:10%
for it lacked the human soul
and could be easily corrupted

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:10%
by those who controlled it.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:10%
That is why I am
making each of you.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:10%
You are all that's
left of humanity.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.002 align:middle line:10%
You are all the
pieces of my soul.

>>DYER: One of the
things that Paracelsus

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
talked about in his writings
was the fact that God created us

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
out of clay, out of the
matter of the Earth,

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and that without His spirit
being breathed into us,

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:90%
we're just husks.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Mm-hmm.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so that's really
the message of this film,

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.920 align:middle line:84%
is that they find their
self, their higher

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:84%
self, their true unity, when
they get back to their source.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And they find where
their origins were,

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.317 align:middle line:84%
and that gives them, then, a
map or a roadway of how to live

00:30:23.317 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and how to be in the future,
because they've discovered,

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, freedom.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And this synthetic determinism
that results from the AI

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:90%
is what was impossible.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It didn't bring what
it promised, the utopia

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:90%
that it promised.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It brought nothing but a
hive-like Borg existence.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they finally free
themselves from this

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:90%
and find their soul.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
a perennial message

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:90%
that we can all take away.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it was
a really good ending.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The matrix that Paracelsus
is talking about

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:90%
is associated with that clay.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when he's
talking about that matrix,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:84%
he's saying that the
matrix is both part of us

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and separate from us.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And that we can use
that matrix to perform

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:90%
our alchemical experiments.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Mm-hmm.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And truly,
the matrix is the clay.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the stuff that
makes this world.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.858 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's the prima materia
that Aristotle talked about,

00:31:16.858 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
which is that
first-formed matter.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And then God the
Creator then forms it

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.090 align:middle line:90%
into some being or some object.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's still not anything
without the breath of life

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:90%
that comes from Him.

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, the
creatures are finally

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
imbued with the creative
soul, and they ascend up

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:90%
into the stars.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: At once, this is a
grim movie, but also a hopeful

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:90%
film.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I like
best about this movie,

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
besides the
interesting plot twist,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
is the architecture
of the film itself--

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the cathedrals, the
cities, the room

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
where the scientist lives in.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It's all filled with
amazing amounts of detail

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:84%
that the filmmakers just did
a great job of putting in.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:10%
Once they discover their
source, once they discover

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.101 align:middle line:10%
the principle of life,
as you mentioned,

00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:10%
they ascended to heaven.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:10%
And we see this
scene where it rains.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:10%
So presumably, the spirits that
have ascended, it sends a rain,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:10%
and we see vegetation
spring back.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.022 align:middle line:10%
So the principle
of life, actually,

00:32:15.022 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:10%
finally comes back, which has
been missing this whole time.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.069 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
a great message.

00:32:19.069 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: That is right.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.985 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly right.

00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:10%
That's what happened
in King Arthur.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:10%
When he's rejuvenated,
the rains come back,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:10%
and the kingdom grows.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's what happens here.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:10%
That is the ultimate alchemy,
is to take the darkness

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.900 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into light,
to turn it into life.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
at the end of this film.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: My takeaway from this
is that we have two children's

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.640 align:middle line:84%
films that tell us
vast allegorical truths

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
about the history, origins,
and the destiny of man.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:84%
They function as a
warning about tech.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
ultimately, what we

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:84%
see is the secret
to our existence

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:84%
can be found in our
origin, in our creator.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And then that will
also give us a map

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.012 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the many,
many cycles in the past

00:33:03.012 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen
throughout history.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Oswald Spengler
talked about history

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
as a constant cycle
of man's failures.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we
can learn from history,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
as Santayana said,
the philosopher,

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
if we can learn from history,
we can avoid those mistakes,

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and we can have a bright future.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: That's right.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it was HG
Wells who said,

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
"History is a race between
education and disaster."

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
these movies are also about,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is trying to educate
us as to what

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
these potential disasters in
the dystopian future will be

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.109 align:middle line:90%
and how to avoid them.
