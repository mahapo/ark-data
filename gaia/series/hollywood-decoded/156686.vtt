>>JAY DYER: Is there a deeper,
hidden, more esoteric meaning

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:84%
to the Hollywood films
that we all love to watch?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jay Dyer.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WEIDNER: And
I'm Jay Weidner.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.756 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching
"Hollywood Decoded."

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:23.532 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: We chose
"Inception" because it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
such a philosophically
profound film.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I think Christopher
Nolan is looking back

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:90%
to ancient Greek mythology.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
He's looking back to
ancient Indian philosophy

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and the Vedic text.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's also
looking to Carl Jung.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And from this
mixture, what we get

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.092 align:middle line:84%
is an artistic presentation
about the depth

00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of the human psyche and that
that's where we actually

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
have to dig down to.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to plumb those
depths to find healing.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes an
archetypal message, itself,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
for how all of mankind
can spiritually progress.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So the whole point
of the movie is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.829 align:middle line:84%
inception, which is to plant
an idea into someone's head.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And what they want
to do is they want

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to plant the idea into
this person's head

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.760 align:middle line:90%
that their father forgave them.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And instead, the father, in
real life, did not forgive them.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But they want to implant that
idea so that that person now

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
believes that they
are their own man.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:90%
They will sell off their empire.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:90%
And the competition will win.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that inception
is this kind of idea

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that is difficult to pull off.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And Cobb is reluctant
to do it because he

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
knows how dangerous it is.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Boxes within boxes.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.111 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
We have a structure that
is our subconscious.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.687 align:middle line:84%
We have another box, which
is the next layer down.

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You have the architecture and
the houses that are there.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.561 align:middle line:84%
You go another layer
down and there's

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
other buildings and architecture
there with a box inside

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
of it, which has a
safe inside of it.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are the layers
of our subconscious.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what's
in the box is the totem.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the totem
that Cobb, himself,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.019 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to
have to know if he

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
was in the waking
or the dream state.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So the final scene is he finds
the totem and he spends it.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:90%
We're never told.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But the point is not really
the waking or the dream state.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The point is finding
solace, finding healing,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and finding peace, which
Cobb actually does.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes, he does.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: With his
children, at the end.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing about this movie

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:90%
is that it's a movie.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And movies are the
closest thing to what

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:90%
the dream state is like.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And Christopher Nolan's really
taken that concept of a movie

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
being, you're in
the dark, and you're

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
seeing images and a story,
which is what a dream is like,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and then taking that and
making the ultimate dream

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.274 align:middle line:90%
movie, which is what this is.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Which is surrealism.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.174 align:middle line:90%
Noir surrealism.

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
We've seen that before, in
other episodes that we've done.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And here, what Nolan
is doing is playing

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
with that in the
context of almost a kind

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.687 align:middle line:90%
of a sci-fi story, in a way.

00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a very interesting mix of--

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
"Blade Runner's" a kind of
a similar idea of mixing

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:90%
sci-fi and surrealism.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But surrealism really
has its origins

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Indian philosophy.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Indian philosophy is
preoccupied with the importance

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:84%
of the waking and the
dream state as equally

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
relevant to man's experience.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so to understand the human
psyche and the human spirit

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.866 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, you
have to understand

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:90%
both of those realms.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You can't just focus
on the waking state

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and empirical observation.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
You also have to look to
these archetypes, which

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung thought you could
pick apart and interpret

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.565 align:middle line:90%
through the dream state.

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And Carl Jung
spent a great deal of time

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
looking at alchemical paintings
from the medieval times

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and showing you that these are
archetypes from a deep state,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:90%
deep symbolic state.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And Nolan's reaching
into his bag of tricks

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and pulling out his
archetypes that he

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
wants you to understand.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And these archetypes
are actually

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
quite profound and deep.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:10%
I'm really impressed
with Nolan's ability

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:10%
to get complex subjects onto the
screen and have it make sense,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.525 align:middle line:10%
where Joe Six-pack could
watch it and like it too.

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:06.655 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:04:06.655 --> 00:04:07.455 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And what's neat about Jung is
that the archetypes, he thinks,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
are actually universal.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.983 align:middle line:84%
There's a collective
unconscious that we all share.

00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go
into that dream state,

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing
phenomena that

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
are, in a quasi-real
sense, happening.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
They're not real in
the same way that it's

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:90%
real in the waking state.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But they're still, in
some spiritual way,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:90%
significant to us, real.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening
here is that Cobb

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to have to work
out his own inner labyrinth

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
in order to find
peace and solace.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually what's
going to happen in the film.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
first clip, which

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
is that he can't
remember where he is,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's a half
remembered dream.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I know what this is.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.374 align:middle line:10%
I've seen one before,
many, many years ago.

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:07.196 align:middle line:10%
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream,

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:10%
a man possessed of
some radical notions.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the most
resilient parasite?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.272 align:middle line:10%
Bacteria?

00:05:21.272 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:10%
A virus?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.267 align:middle line:10%
An intestinal worm?

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh, what Mr. Cobb
is trying to say--

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:10%
>> An idea.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Resilient.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Highly contagious.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Once an idea has taken
hold of the brain,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:10%
it's almost impossible
to eradicate.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:10%
An idea that is
fully formed, fully

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.155 align:middle line:10%
understood, that sticks
right in there somewhere.

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The first thing
that sticks out to me

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
about this scene is that he's
meeting with a man from the Far

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:90%
East, Saito.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is an interaction with
far Eastern culture, which

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
has always focused
on the holistic dream

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.374 align:middle line:90%
state of our waking state.

00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, that reality
is a kind of maya or illusory

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.429 align:middle line:84%
experience and that the
true reality might actually

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
be either a combination
of the waking

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and the dream state,
or the dream state.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have at
the beginning of the film

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.438 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
end of the film.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
This is Cobb sunk down
at the very lowest aspect

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:90%
of his subconscious.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And he's forgotten himself.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is a perennial
aspect of gnostic philosophy,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have forgotten
our true origins.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
We're lost in a dream state.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And can we wake up
within this dream state?

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's Cobb's
process of coming out

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of this maze, this labyrinth,
is finding who he really was.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So time also
has three dimensions, just

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:90%
as space has three dimensions.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're sleeping,
you're not moving.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:90%
You're in bed.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But in your dream state, you're
moving around in a world,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:90%
a world that is mysterious.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And who constructed
this world, really?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you're awake, you
are moving around in 3D space.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But your brain is
linear now and not

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
thinking the way it
thinks in a dream state.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
This movie is so
much like a dream

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's so non-linear
that, like "Memento," you're

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
bouncing around,
and at first glance,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you're really kind of
not sure what's going on.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you really get
to understand the landscape

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that Nolan is creating
here, it's really brilliant.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.157 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's a complement to
"Insomnia," his other film,

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:27.957 align:middle line:90%
his early film--

00:07:27.957 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: --where they're
stuck in Alaska.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's during the period when
there's extensive sunlight.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And you can't sleep.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they're imagining
being forced into the waking

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:84%
state and how it
would drive you mad.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Here, you're forced into a
perpetual dream state and how

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
it would, in a
way, drive you mad

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.159 align:middle line:84%
or into a kind of
forgetfulness of who you are.

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening with Cobb

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.944 align:middle line:84%
is that he's got to overcome
this trauma with his wife, Mal.

00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all the names
have significance here,

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Mal being in the
Latin, the root malice.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And so she represents, kind of,
his shade in the Jungian sense.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:10%
Saito is a kind of
far Eastern mystic

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:10%
and represents Eastern thought.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other characters--
the Michael Caine character

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
represents, kind of, the
sage, the wisdom archetype.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
characters are archetypes.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And they are manifestations
of his psyche,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
as he explains to
the other characters

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that he thinks he's
helping in their dreams.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.822 align:middle line:84%
Which is actually all
happening within his dream.

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:22.621 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So the whole movie is
actually his dream.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I think so.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.355 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:25.355 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And we never really find
out if he ever really

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:90%
is reunited or anything.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think the movie is
really about getting caught

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
in a dilemma that you cannot get
out of, which is like Ariadne

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
again, trying to find your way
out of the labyrinth but not

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
really ever finding
your way out.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, we're going
to see an interesting aspect

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to the connection between the
subconscious and a labyrinth,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
or a maze, which goes
back to ancient Egypt

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and other cultures.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's prominent
in this film.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:90%
And getting out of that maze.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look at
we're working together.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:10%
>> We were working together.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:10%
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:10%
And I kept pushing things.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to go
deeper and deeper.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to go further.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:10%
I just didn't
understand the concept

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:10%
that hours could turn into years
down there, that we could get

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:10%
trapped so deep that when we--

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:10%
when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:10%
we lost sight of what was real.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So what we have
here is a lot of tie-ins

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:10%
to mythology and
ancient traditions.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:10%
>> We created.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.196 align:middle line:10%
We built the world
for ourselves.

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:45.742 align:middle line:10%
We did that for years.

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:10%
We built our own world.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.645 align:middle line:10%
>> How long were
you stuck there?

00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Something like 50 years.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.555 align:middle line:10%
>> Jeez.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:10%
How could you stand it?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.155 align:middle line:10%
>> It wasn't so bad at
first, feeling like Gods.

00:10:05.155 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:10%
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, it just
became impossible

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:10%
for me to live like that.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.692 align:middle line:10%
>> And what about for her?

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>> She had locked
something away,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.267 align:middle line:10%
something deep inside her, a
truth that she had once known

00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:26.161 align:middle line:10%
but--

00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:10%
but chose to forget.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.114 align:middle line:10%
Limbo became her reality.

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So in the
Greek tradition,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
you have the story of
King Minos imprisoning

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Theseus in his labyrinth.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's Ariadne who's
the character who

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
helps him get out.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Ellen Page character
here is playing that role.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:90%
She is Ariadne by the name.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And what she is doing
is trying to help

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Cobb realize that he's stuck in
this prison of his own making.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a solipsism,
which in philosophy is just

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
the idea that everything is
a projection of our mind.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
That also ties into the ancient
Vedic tradition of maya,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that the reality
that we experience

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
is something that's either
a psychological projection

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:84%
of our minds, of
our subconscious,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
or it's just a
fantasmical illusion.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And that that awakening actually
centers around coming out

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:90%
of that dream state.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.073 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happens to Cobb here

00:11:21.073 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:84%
is that he is in a kind of
Hades or a kind of underworld.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- the
deeper that they go--

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
he calls it the shores
of the subconscious--

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:90%
he's stuck there.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about him getting
out of that through the process

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.035 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual awakening.

00:11:35.035 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think that
we have to understand

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that Cobb has fallen into
this hell, this Hades.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in this
movie is falling.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The kick, which is how you
find out where you are in time,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is you falling backwards.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The van on the
bridge is falling.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Mal jumps to her death.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The falling is, itself,
what you're doing.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Every layer you go down
deeper, time is more stretched,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:90%
it takes longer.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Japanese fellow,
he is living 50,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
60 years down at the very
bottom sublevel, where

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Cobb is trying to save him.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Whether he actually
does save him or not

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
is really kind of
evasive because we

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:84%
don't know if we're
watching Cobb's dream

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
through the entire movie or
Cobb coming out of his dream

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the movie.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.676 align:middle line:90%
It's left a little ambiguous.

00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But we have what they call,
in the film, the totem.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.236 align:middle line:84%
And the totem is supposed to be
the key that helps you wake up

00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and realize whether
you're in the dream state

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:90%
or the waking state.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And we never know until the
end what Mal has hidden away

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:90%
in this box.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:10%
But I think the real
secret of the film

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:10%
is that Mal and what's in the
box is ultimately about Cobb.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Because there's also the Cillian
Murphy character, Fischer.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
There's some secret
that's stashed

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
away in some safe
somewhere that that

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be his story.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But all of these character
stories and unconscious

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're stepping
into in the film,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
it's all Cobb's unconscious.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
That box, that treasure
that's hidden away,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is the secret that
he has with Mal.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's that him and Mal
had a traumatic experience.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.592 align:middle line:90%
And he's blaming himself.

00:13:23.592 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And he can never get out of
this until he forgives himself.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: He understands
the concept of inception

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
because he put a
thought into Mal.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And that thought is like
a Frankenstein monster

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:90%
coming back to haunt him.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So he also knows that you can
implant a thought in someone,

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's not necessarily
a good thing.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, it
cost Mal her life.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.892 align:middle line:90%
And he blames himself for that.

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:50.115 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:13:50.115 --> 00:13:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right?

00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the only way that
he's going to find redemption

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:84%
is through self-forgive--
forgiving himself, basically.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.295 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That's the
whole point of the film.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.416 align:middle line:84%
But it's just fascinating to
me that all these characters,

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
all these names, they
have some significance.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Cobb, I think,
you could probably

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
connect it to Kabbalah.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Or he works for this
enigmatic company, Cobol,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:90%
which we never know what it is.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
But what's
interesting about that

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
is that there's even a
kind of a hint from Mal,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
where she says to him, stop and
think about this for a minute.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You're being chased
around the globe

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
by enigmatic corporations.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got some box
that lets you step

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:90%
into other people's dreams.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that sound a
little fantastical?

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.816 align:middle line:90%
But he believes it's real.

00:14:32.816 --> 00:14:33.616 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:14:33.616 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So we're being given
clues that this whole thing is

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.259 align:middle line:90%
Cobb's dream.

00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Well, it does.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's Cobb having
almost a James Bond kind

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of dream, where
he's in adventures

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
in the snow, and skiing, and
car chases, and the whole thing.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.134 align:middle line:90%
And it's come--

00:14:53.134 --> 00:14:54.175 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's fantastical.

00:14:54.175 --> 00:14:55.216 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah, it does.

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It becomes ridiculously
fantastical at some point.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, oh, this
has to be Cobb's dream.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And Cobb is still stuck
down there somewhere.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe nobody in this
movie is actually real.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.185 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Except for Cobb.

00:15:08.185 --> 00:15:10.185 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: They're all
manifestations of his psyche

00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because if you notice, at no
point do they come after Cobb,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that I can recall.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.257 align:middle line:84%
That was one of his keys
to let you know that you're

00:15:18.257 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:90%
in your dream state.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Right.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So I think,
next, we want

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to look at what is the key
to how he, in some degree,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.606 align:middle line:84%
gets out of the-- he may not
totally get out of the dream

00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
state, but at least,
achieves some kind

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of solace or some kind
of spiritual plateau

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.037 align:middle line:90%
where he can find happiness.

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
finally forgives himself.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.786 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at you
have to forgive yourself.

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Your guilt defines her.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:10%
It's what powers her.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:10%
You are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:10%
And if we are going
to succeed in this,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:10%
you have to forgive yourself.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to
have to confront her.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:10%
But you don't have
to do that alone.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no, no.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm doing it for the others
because they have no idea

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.034 align:middle line:10%
the risk they've taken,
coming down here with you.

00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Cobb has
been traumatized.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's traumatized by,
apparently, the suicide

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:90%
of his wife at some point.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that
he blames himself for this.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's a prisoner
of his memories.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
That's another
aspect of this film

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
is that we can be prisoners to
things that we've done wrong

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
in the past that can haunt
us and cause us to basically

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:90%
have a miserable life.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only way out
of that is to realize

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that the message of these
kinds of movies, these kinds

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.795 align:middle line:90%
of films, can be healing.

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It can be redemptive.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It can show us that through
forgiving ourselves and letting

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
these things go, we
can actually move on

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:90%
in the process of healing.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: So the scene in the
movie where Ariadne is learning

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
her practice, how to construct
the worlds in the dream state,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and she takes these two giant
mirrors that she constructs

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.036 align:middle line:84%
and puts them across from each
other and creates that kind

00:16:56.036 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:84%
of-- you know,
the mirror effect,

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
where he's caught in
the infinite time--

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
right?-- I think this is very
symbolic of the trap that

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Leonar--

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:90%
that Cobb is caught in.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about that scene, and some

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of the other scenes, is if you
start talking about the dream

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:84%
state to each
other in the dream,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
you cause all the people,
your fantastic people that

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:84%
aren't real, to suddenly
become antagonistic toward you

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're beginning to
realize that they're not real.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're caught
in your dream.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And they don't like it.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yeah.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
things going on here.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with these
various levels and dream states

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is that Cobb is having to
work out not just the issue

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:90%
with Mal but also other issues.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So the Fischer character that's
played by Cillian Murphy,

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
he's having this
battle with his father

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.265 align:middle line:84%
over the empire,
this giant wealth,

00:17:53.265 --> 00:17:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, that they have stored
up, that he's inheriting.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in some way,
some kind of an issue

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that Cobb has with his father.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
child/father battle

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
over who's going to take on the
reins of power and so forth.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
aspect of what

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Cobb's having to work through.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So none of the stories
are about Fischer.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not about Ariadne.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not about Mal.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all about Cobb and all
of these different traumas.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we know from
psychology is that trauma

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:90%
can fragment our psyche.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.007 align:middle line:84%
It can cause us to be
split and disintegrated.

00:18:26.007 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
Carl Jung always talked about

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:10%
was integration.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And so he--

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Cobb is going through this
self-actualization and

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
self-integration process, in
all these levels of the dream

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:90%
state, to achieve healing.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:10%
>>WEIDNER: That's a very
interesting interpretation,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:10%
in that the entire movie is
just Cobb's dream and reflection

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:10%
of his own life and
that everybody in there

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.165 align:middle line:10%
is essentially maya, in the
whole movie, except for him.

00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:10%
And so the question
then becomes,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:10%
does he get out of
the dream or not?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
left up to debate.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:90%
But we see the top spinning.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: We don't
know, at the end,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:10%
whether it might look like a
little-- wobbles a little bit,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:10%
which would mean
that he's waking up.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:10%
But he may not wake up because
he's back with his children.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:10%
And so he does find
some kind of redemption.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:10%
So the next clip
we want to look at

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:10%
is the explicit statement
that your world is not real.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Listen.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:10%
There's something you should
know about me, about inception.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:10%
An idea is like a virus,
resilient, highly contagious.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:10%
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.808 align:middle line:10%
It can grow to define
or destroy you.

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.944 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The smallest idea, such
as your world is not real.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.934 align:middle line:10%
So certain of your world?

00:20:00.934 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:10%
Of what's real?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:10%
Do you think he is?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:10%


00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.266 align:middle line:10%
Or do you think he's
as lost as I was?

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I know what's real, Mal.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:10%
>> No creeping doubts?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:10%
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.458 align:middle line:10%
persecute the dreamer?

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:10%
Admit it.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.402 align:middle line:10%
You don't believe in
one reality anymore.

00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:36.365 align:middle line:10%
So choose.

00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:38.825 align:middle line:10%
Choose to be here.

00:20:38.825 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Choose me.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: One of the clues that we
know that this is all going on

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in Cobb's mind, in
his subconscious,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you
see, in one scene,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Mal stepping on a wine
glass, and then, later, you

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
see the same scene
played out again,

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's Ariadne that
steps on the wine glass.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And so she is appearing
to him and trying

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
to lead him and
heal him in a way.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.441 align:middle line:84%
So she functions as
this kind of guide,

00:21:03.441 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
which is what she functions
as in the Greek mythology.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
To lead him out of the trauma
state of being stuck in Hades

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and towards finding redemption.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But there's all kinds
of clues like that

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that I think show us that the
whole story is Cobb's healing

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, it's an
allegory for all of us.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:90%
We all have the same traumas.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
We can all be fragmented
in our psyche and so forth,

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:90%
in some degree.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's really through
the integration process

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.295 align:middle line:84%
that Carl Jung talked about
that we can find this healing.

00:21:34.295 --> 00:21:36.461 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: I think that is
what this movie is about.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately a
very optimistic film.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Once more, Chris
Nolan takes us down

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.522 align:middle line:84%
deep into our psyche, which
he did in the Batman series--

00:21:44.522 --> 00:21:45.322 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Mm-hmm.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:45.543 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:45.543 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:90%
--and Memento.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in the end,
this is probably his best film,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to date, and definitely one
of the most intellectually

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.885 align:middle line:90%
challenging films ever made.

00:21:56.885 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The idea of
architecture fills this film.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:10%
And we see cities being
built in the mind.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:10%
We see cities that
we think are actually

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:10%
out there in the external
world, but they're also

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:10%
part of the mind.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.006 align:middle line:10%
And they exist in different
forms and different layers

00:22:10.006 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:10%
and different levels.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:10%
When they get to the lowest
level, subconscious, it's--

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:10%
Cobb has constructed a world
that is based on prior memories

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:10%
in the waking state,
where he and his wife

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:10%
were building sandcastles.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:10%
But in his subconscious, they
are these giant structures

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:10%
that seem to fall apart, like
when they were destroying

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.477 align:middle line:10%
the sandcastles.

00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:10%
What is the meaning of all that?

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's that our mind is,
I think, structured, in a way,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.800 align:middle line:10%
kind of like a building.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.609 align:middle line:84%
There is an architecture
of the mind.

00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And there's layers to the mind.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.357 align:middle line:84%
And many great
psychologists, philosophers,

00:22:40.357 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:84%
ancient religious traditions
have spoken this way.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Ancient Indians.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
spoke this way.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the point of this movie;
very deep, very esoteric,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is that mankind, as a
whole, and each individual

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:90%
has the same issues.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:84%
They have the same
problems and traumas.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And the way out of the maze
that we're all stuck in

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
is the same for all of us.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We all have to face the
trauma, forgive ourselves,

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
go through a
reconciliation process,

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
an actualization process,
an awakening process.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Healing and integration
then occurs.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And we progress on into
the spiritual state forever

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.505 align:middle line:84%
and ever, I would say, because
I think there is an afterlife.

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The film kind of
shows that, too.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It kind of hints that
the p-- did he die?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Is he in some sort of
dream coma, spiritual state

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%
where he's passed on?

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it's
a positive message

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
about not fearing death,
about being reconciled

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and progressing into eternity.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yeah.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that the
reason that he's showing us

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
all of this architecture
is Jung frequently

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:84%
asked himself, where do
all these images come from?

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a dream of a
city that does not exist.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Did I build this city?

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Did I make it?

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Did it come from somewhere else?

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
Nolan is asking us here.

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:90%
Where do these things come from?

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:90%
How is it possible?

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I had
a dream once where

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I watched a band
with like 21 members

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
play a very complicated
piece of music

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
that I had never heard before.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Did I make that music up?

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Did I compose that
music in my dream?

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Or did it come from
somewhere else?

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, this
is what Nolan is asking.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:90%
What is real?

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:90%
And what isn't?

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that process
of bifurcated reality

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
between the dream state
and the waking state

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
to become a more
full human being,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to get past the trauma
of our childhood

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.342 align:middle line:84%
and possible parental
mistakes, and find our way out

00:24:38.342 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of the wilderness, out
of the maze, as you say.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
redeeming aspects

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.262 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Indian philosophy is
that it taught that very thing.

00:24:44.262 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WEIDNER: Yes.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.588 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It taught that the
waking state and the dream

00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:84%
state were equally important
and that to unify these two,

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, would
be, at least, one

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:84%
stage on the process
of enlightenment,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't be
split between these two

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.995 align:middle line:84%
seemingly different
worlds, the outer world.

00:24:58.995 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're
in the dream state,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
we're involved in the
inner subconscious world.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:84%
If these two worlds could be
united, then we would, I think,

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:90%
have much more insight.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
We would be able to
experience reality

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:90%
in a very different way.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what I think is

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
at the core of
enlightenment, at least,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:90%
in that ancient tradition.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WEIDNER: And we
know, in real life,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that when Crick and
Watson were trying

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to discover the shape of DNA,
they struggled and struggled.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And one night Crick was
exhausted, went home,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and dreamed of the
shape of the DNA,

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and became the Nobel Prize
winning discovery of the 50s.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that
dreams can teach us

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
about this hard, cold
reality we live in.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And that hard, cold reality
can also affect the dreams.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And together, they work
together to help us understand

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
what we are as an individual.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:90%
