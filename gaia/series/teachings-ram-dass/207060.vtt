00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You and I have cultivated
certain awareness.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We have a certain ability
to hold more than one plane

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:90%
consciously.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We may not have
integrated them fully.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, I know that there
is incredible pollution

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and that a tremendous
amount of that pollution

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is caused by automobiles and
that the wisest person is

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the one that would either
walk, bicycle, and then

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
use the public
transportation next,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and then after that would
have an electric car

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
or then would have a
low-gas, high-efficiency car.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, when we
feel the potential of change

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and we see that we are part
of the social institutions,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
we can change all of
it from within because

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of the web of communication
and the information age.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what we are about.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
It is not just that
we do something.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:90%
It's how we do something.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And which we do is dependent
in each of you on what

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
your unique predicament is.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know at this
moment whether I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
am sitting at the bedside of
the birth of another level

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Am I sitting at the bedside
of a dying or of being born?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Or is the world of
"or" just another plane

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of reality and behind
it all birth and death

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
are the same thing
and what I'm sitting

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:90%
at is the edge of the mystery?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The interesting question
you and I can look at

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you
deal with mystery?

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal
with the unknown?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with it?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
is I don't know.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't doesn't have to
be, oh my God, I don't know.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, can
you live now rooted

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
enough in other
planes of awareness

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so that you can sit with the
uncertainty of not knowing

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
how all this comes out
and not be immobilized

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:90%
by that uncertainty?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you sit with it in such a
way that you are doing what you

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
do because it's in these--
you'd call your Dharma--

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
without an attachment
to how it comes out?

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I will still, whether it's
going to end or begin,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
the best thing I can still do
is quiet my mind so I can hear.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Truth waits for eyes unclouded
by longing, the Tao says.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I can open my heart
so I can be part

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
of the liquidity of the
universe, like a tree is

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:90%
or like a river is.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I can take my place in
it without the mediation

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of my self-conscious mind.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, now I'm being a tree.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I can balance discriminative
wisdom or that part that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
uses the judging mind with
appreciation, with gratitude,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
with appreciation for the
awesome nature of the mystery

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:90%
of suffering and death.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Too little trust in
wisdom and too much

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
expectation about knowledge
that it takes discipline

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to empty the mind
to hear the answer,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to fill the
mind with more facts.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Not that you don't use the
facts and delight in them

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and play with them.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
But don't make them your deity.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't worship the rational mind.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
See it as a beautiful
instrument and a lousy master.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity you and
I have is to listen,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is to open our hearts to
grieving with each other.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
When I asked Zalman
Schachter, the rabbi,

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
if you were an Israeli, what
would you say to an Arab?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, before
we can hear each other,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to be able to
grieve with one another,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that until the Arab feels heard
by the Jew and the Jew feels

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
heard by the Arab,
heard in their pain,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
they cannot meet as
children of the same father.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And for you to hear
your enemy's pain

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
requires a quality
of compassion,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and a quality of fearlessness,
and a quality of willingness

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
to allow your heart to be broken
again and again, embracing

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of birth,
the nature of death,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the quality of suffering, being
able to look it in the eye

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, so that
you're not copping out

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
with reactivity into
righteousness into denial

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
into hysteria into violence, but
you stay wide open to what is.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:90%
You listen.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You listen your way into
hearing your part in the game.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you play
it with a giggle

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
because, after all, it's
just another mind moment.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:90%
