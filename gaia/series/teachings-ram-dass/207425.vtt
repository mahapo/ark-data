00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If you really want to get
high, try living in truth,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%
it's very scary.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Living in truth does not mean
telling everybody everything

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that you think because
most people don't

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:90%
want to know the truth.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But it does mean being
truthful with yourself

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and it means that you
are available to be

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
truthful with other
people if they

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:90%
are willing to share truth.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:10%
I often sit with
people and the game

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:10%
is a very scary and fierce one.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:10%
You can feel what it feels like
I just mentioned; some of you

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:10%
have even played it with me.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:10%
The question is asked, we
look into each other's eyes,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.872 align:middle line:10%
we look at the point
between the eyes

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:10%
and the question is to
ask if there is anything

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:10%
that you can bring to mind
that would be difficult,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:10%
embarrassing, or uncomfortable
to share with me about yourself

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.812 align:middle line:10%
or about me, share it.

00:01:16.812 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And immediately into your mind
comes all kinds of things,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
immediately things you've
never thought about,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:90%
they're not even your thoughts.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
They just pour into your
mind and you think, oh, I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:90%
can't tell them that.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And you start to say now, I'm
going to tell you this thing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's really not my thought.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.883 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it came from.

00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Now then, you cut
out all the crap

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and you just trust each
other and here we are.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the
thing that keeps us apart

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
are the thoughts that
you and I have which

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
when you think them
push another person away

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
because they make the
other person him or her

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:90%
rather than us.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I want to live in a world of us.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
live in a world of us,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't really
afford any secrets.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Because all my secrets
keep people away

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:10%
so I publish all my
secrets because I just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:10%
realized that it's just much
more free to just let it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:10%
all hang out.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you can look
at everybody as us.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It's very scary
but very exciting.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And truth indeed
does get you high,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:90%
but it's a delicate contrast.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple come to
me several months ago

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were thinking
of getting married.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
them, well, I think

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
get married and you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
want me to have
anything to do with it,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:90%
it ought to be done in truth.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh yes,
we want it done in truth.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I
mean really truth.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, everything's fine.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:90%
She was the most vocal about it.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.155 align:middle line:10%
So I said all right just
face each other look

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:10%
in each other's eyes.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK now,
if there is anything

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring
to mind that would

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.365 align:middle line:84%
be difficult or embarrassing
or uncomfortable to share,

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:90%
share it.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:10%
And he says to her,
well, I have to tell you

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:10%
that right after we
started going together,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:10%
I was with Kathy and
she said, you what?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And she turned into
this totally betrayed,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
hurt, angry human being.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And she just lashed,
you betrayed this trust.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
All the time you were with
me and you didn't-- he said,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to but I was afraid to.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't see how
I can be with you anymore.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I said, OK, you have
a choice at this point.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:90%
He's playing to live in truth.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And after about 20 minutes,
her body, which was tense

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
started to loosen and loosen
and loosen, and she let it go.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And finally, after about a
half hour, I could say, right,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:10%
and here we are.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there is
anything you can

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
bring to mind that would be
difficult, embarrassing--

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and we just kept doing
it until finally, they

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
were really straight
and you could imagine

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that a whole year, they had been
going with him knowing that he

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
had that thing in him
that she couldn't know,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.513 align:middle line:84%
and her saying when
she came to me,

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking we should get
married, we want to get married

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little afraid of it.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:90%
What is she afraid of?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
What is she picking up?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
She's picking up that
tension that exists.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And the reason he can't
tell her is because he's

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.290 align:middle line:10%
afraid of just what happened.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's a conspiracy
of concealment

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:10%
that keeps them both distanced
in a way that ends up

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:10%
with a marriage that's OK but
it sure isn't living spirit.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know
about you, but I would

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:10%
like to live in the spirit.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a little
bit like playing tennis.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You meet on a tennis court
and you are competing.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But you collaborated to meet
on the tennis court to compete.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's really two
planes of reality.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
There's the plane in
which you're collaborators

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's the plane in
which you're competitors.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So there is the
plane in which you

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
are two separate people full of
lust, greed, hatred, ill-will,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:90%
sloth, and doubt.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
the other plane

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
in which you are awareness.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And when the eyes meet,
the eyes meet as awareness.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why the eyes are called
the windows of the soul.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you can sit
down with anybody else

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and sit eye to eye, not social
hello in there, I'm here.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:90%
Not that.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why I talk about focusing
on the point between the eyes.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a meditative space but
it's a clear connection.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And then out of here,
run all the stuff.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And then each stuff will have
all the reactions in people,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
let them run through, and
then very quietly you'll

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
come back to hear.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Try living in truth.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.291 align:middle line:90%
