[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:16.269 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Everywhere you look, you
see what you're looking for.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Where you are looking for
God, everywhere you look,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:90%
you see God.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.940 align:middle line:84%
People tell me I can't
live in the city.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
People tell me I can't
live with my partner.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
People tell me I can't
live in this world of anger

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and corruption.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look, you
see what you're looking for.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking for
God, all you see is God.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Maharajah once went to
visit a young fellow who

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
was in a college
dormitory, and the fellow

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
had a pinup a on his wall.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he suddenly realized
Maharajah was in the room,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
he freaked and he quickly got
up and he turned the picture

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:90%
to the wall.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And Maharajah said
don't do that.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the divine mother.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you look, you see
what you're looking for.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking for
God, all you see is God.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
How do you stay with God by
stopping reading newspapers,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
turning off the news,
by isolating yourself?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Its God at the top of
a mountain, by a river?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it all just the dance,
the dance of Kali, the dance

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of Shiva, the dance
of life energy?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I came to Maharajah
once and I said,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Maharajah, you can't
send me back to America.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm too impure.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And he came up very
close and he looked at me

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and he looked at my
forehead, my eyes.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
He looked at my nose.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
He looked at my beard,
and then he said to me

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't see any impurity.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you look, you see
what you're looking for.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking for
God, all you see is God.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
What could it possibly mean
to transform the world?

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
The transformation doesn't
begin with an institution.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't organize to
transform the universe.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't get a God
squad together to do it.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We start with the
individual human heart.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
We start right here
inside our self.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And when your apparatus
of perceiving and sensing

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
is transformed, then everywhere
you walk, there is only God.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that you
meet has an opportunity

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to see God in themselves
when they look into your eyes

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because you are a mirror
because that's what

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
you are looking at in them.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And when people come to
you and they are angry,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:90%
do you see the anger?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you look, you see
what you're looking for.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
When you're in your
ego, you see the anger.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking for
God, you know what you see?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:90%
All you see is God.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Right in the human
heart, the whole process

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
starts, the great
transformation that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.515 align:middle line:84%
is underway, that is
labeled by so many labels.

00:03:46.515 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It's labeled as narcissism,
self-preoccupation,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
as the generation of
me-ism, as decadence.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's a reawakening
and a re-understanding

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that the basic institution
is the human heart,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:90%
the individual human heart.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
No bureaucracy will
transform Earth into heaven,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
but a human heart,
your heart, can do it.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.515 align:middle line:84%
It takes only one heart
to start the whole chain.

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Meher Baba wrote love has
to spring spontaneously

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It is in no way amenable to any
form of inner or outer force.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
True love is unconquerable
and irresistible,

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and it goes on gathering
power and spreading itself

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:84%
until eventually it transforms
everyone whom it touches.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
