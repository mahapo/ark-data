00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the changes
that one goes through,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
one must recognize that
even though you see where

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going, it is important
that you honor where

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:90%
you've been.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And that involves grieving.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It involves acknowledging
and giving space to.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when you move from
like the whole initiation

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
rites of going from
childhood to adulthood,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
there is a process in the
initiation of leaving childhood

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:90%
behind.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, as we go
in spiritual journey,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
there is a loss of the dreams
we were functioning under,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of the models we are
functioning under.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have to slow down
enough to bury the dead,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to sort of allow the thing
to have its completion

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in the process of going on.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
get obsessed with it,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want
to push it away.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And often, in our
culture particularly,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I see people
unwilling to grieve,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
unwilling to honor
where they've been,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
unwilling to honor the losses.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've built a whole
world on a myth of happiness

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
coming from a certain thing
and then you get there

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
you've been had,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't what
it's about, think

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of the investment, of the depth
you've invested in that myth.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just say, well,
that's over now, I'll go on.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You have really got
to grieve for it

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to
have its completion.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're in
between and learning

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
how to grieve for the
dream of our innocence

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
through all of the stuff that
went on in our childhood.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Grieve and then go on.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And grieve and then go on.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to
play with that balance.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't get caught.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't push away.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't get caught.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't push away.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And this for me is the
truth of the relationship

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
between personality and
spiritual dimension,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:90%
spiritual perception.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
That I feel it is this
kind of intimate dance

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that my personality,
my karma as manifest

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
through my personality, guides
me into spiritual practices.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual practices lead me
to reperceive my personality.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The reperceiving leads me to
come back and do more work

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
on my personality from a
different point of view.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The different point
of view leads me

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
to a new spiritual practices
or doing the practices

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:90%
from a different place.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:84%
As I come into these
practices, there's more space.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of space,
certain personality stuff

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:84%
arises that I never
noticed before.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's like skimming soup.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I go back
and I skim some more.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I go back
in my practice.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is no dishonor
as a spiritual person

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
in working with
personality stuff,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
working with neurotic
relationships, and all that.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is it is like
the garden of infinite delights.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly seductive.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And you must balance
it all the time

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
with very deep
spiritual practices

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
in order to not get sucked in.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be very aware,
because many of us in the West

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
have fallen for it of getting
into very high spiritual states

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
by pushing away our
personality stuff.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's still uncooked.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
We haven't dealt with it.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
So watch that balance.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any of us
are masters at this game

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:90%
yet, that I know of.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's grieving, letting
go, grieving, letting go,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:90%
letting the models die.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think part
of that is becoming

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with
the idea of death

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and your non-existence in the
form you've been attached to.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Grieving your own death is an
interesting way of saying it.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Rilke's line is so beautiful.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
That one can contain
death, the whole of death,

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
can hold it in
one's heart gentle,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and not refuse to go on
living is inexpressible.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Is inexpressible.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
To live this moment not denying
the fragility of the forms,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:90%
it's like looking at suffering.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
To keep your eyes open
and looking at what is.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
To look at the violence, the
cruelty, the greed, the fear,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the agitation, the lust,
the doubt, all of it,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
the sloth and torpor, all of it.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
To look at it all,
look at it all,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and have the perspective
of the balance of saying,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I am looking directly into the
light of the mystery and to not

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
flicker and turn away
the mystery of death,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to sit with it and from
out of that to act.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And the statement "It's too
much for me," I can't stand it.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Look again.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Look again at who the
"me" is and whether you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:90%
want to hold on to that "me."

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Saints in India are often called
"the living dead," because they

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
bear the unbearable.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It is unbearable.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of pushing away
to make it bearable for who you

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
think you are, you
surrender who you

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:90%
think you are into the ocean.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.415 align:middle line:84%
And then it is bearable
because you aren't.

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:90%
It just all is.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And out of all of it
comes a compassion

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:90%
that is breathtaking.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the genuine compassion
of your deepest truth.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:90%
And it rises up.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And your acts towards
other human being

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
aren't because you're
good, or you're kind,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
or you even want to help them.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
That's all interesting,
but that's not what it is.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the compassion of
the universe rising up

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:90%
in relation to the suffering.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It's this dance.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.686 align:middle line:84%
It's this incredible
tension and play of form.

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is,
wow, it's incredible.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It is incredible.
