>> Grace is the touch of those
beings who were free to leave

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and elected not to do so.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
For they are not here because
of their personal karma.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
They are here as perfect
and pure instruments of God.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:90%
They are the gurus, the saints.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
They live now or lived
on this plane in the past

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and still live.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Christ said, when
you call me, I come.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:90%
But who calls him in faith?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding you, right
by you at any moment,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
are the highest beings who
have stayed in form only

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:90%
to bring you to liberation.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But what is required is that
you ask, that you reach up,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and you say, me.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Come on, God, listen to me.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I want to go, too.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to know you.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to know myself.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Because what does it turn out?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
How bizarre that when you
keep going higher and clearer,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and higher and clearer,
and higher and clearer,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:90%
who do you end up being?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Ramana Maharshi
said it very simply.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
God, guru, and self
are the same thing.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So who is it that turned
out designing the game you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:90%
think you're stuck in?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You designed it, now
you're playing it out.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, you will awaken
out of it, until you are free.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you're free to
continue to play or not.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
That is the true
Bodhisattva vow.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And you stay in form not
because you want anything,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
because everything you want is
fulfilled by being with God.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
For that is the
all and everything.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:90%
It is the total fulfillment.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
It is the complete going home.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the Om.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything you ever wanted.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what God was saying.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:90%
He said it to Adam and Eve.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
If you get caught
in your own mind

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and in seeing me as an
object and pushing me away,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
you will go through hells
until you awaken again

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that in
the surrender to me,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:90%
you are fulfilled.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
You work to get a new car, to
have security and pleasure,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and then it's all in time and
it's passing, and you grow old,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and you die.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Because all of Earth
existence is in time,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and it is passing show.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
You're a great success, and a
moment later, you're forgotten.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Look on my works, ye mighty,
said Ozymandias in despair,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
but nothing remains
but that tablet.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But in you is that
which is beyond time.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with time.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with space.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And once you have let go
of the clinging to who you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:90%
thought you were--

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you don't push it away, you
just don't cling to it--

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you begin to recognize
who you also are.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And who you also
are is all of it.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
The great saint
Rama Tirtha said, I

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:90%
am without form, without limit.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I am beyond space.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I am beyond time.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:90%
I am in everything.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in me.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:90%
I am the bliss of the universe.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I am Satcitananda, absolute
existence, absolute knowledge,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
absolute bliss,
Tatvamasi, I am that.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We were so busy looking
down, we forgot God.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Then we got so busy looking at
God, we forget to look down.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Final liberation is where you
look up, and you look down.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
You cling to neither
this nor that.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
That is perfection.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
That is what the being
who you are is capable of.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
You are God made manifest.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Know yourself.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Whisper it now.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Not as labels, not I am
God, but beyond label.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of your Earth
existence is n dimensional.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It's everything,
in all directions.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So you listen, but
there is no listening.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I speak, but there
is no speaking.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
We sit in the silence behind
form and play with God.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And all the forms
are our playthings,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:90%
including our bodies.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
That is the joy that
comes with freedom.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Once you know, from
then on, there is only

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:90%
play with God, nothing else.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
For all form is
play, nothing else.
