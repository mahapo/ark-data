[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:17.712 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Close your eyes and feel
all of the tension in the body

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and in the mind that is
connected with your model about

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.495 align:middle line:90%
what this moment is about.

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Getting here, the
beginning, what you want.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself
silently, what is it I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
really want out of this moment?

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
How would I like to be what
is keeping me from being

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.745 align:middle line:90%
that way at this moment?

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But if some real change
were to happen to us,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe we have to
empty the cup in order

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to allow it to be filled.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.175 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we have to let go.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:90%
We've done it.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.485 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten here, now we
can let go of that phase.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:90%
And we can just open to what is.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe the
true growth will not

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
follow our expectations,
and maybe your wanting mind

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
will block you from
receiving just that food

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:90%
that you hunger for.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Take another slow, deep breath.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the out-breath,
just let go

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
of all of our models and
plans and expectations, fears,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:90%
and just taste of this moment.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We are a group of beings,
sharing consciousness,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
sharing our hearts, sharing
the roadmaps of our journeys.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
What we are here for is
transformation of being,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
not the collecting
of experiences.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
For no matter how many
experiences we collect,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:90%
it will never be enough.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.415 align:middle line:84%
But we the experiencer will
always be a breath away

00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:08.215 align:middle line:90%
from this moment.

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're diving into an
ocean beyond the separation

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:90%
of experiencer and experience.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.705 align:middle line:84%
The notion that has
very little form.

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this sutra
from the Dao De Jing,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:90%
which concerns this moment.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They call it elusive,
and say that one looks

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.205 align:middle line:90%
but it never appears.

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
They say, indeed it
is rare since one

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:90%
listens but never a sound.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Subtle, they call it.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.325 align:middle line:84%
And say that one grasps
it but never gets hold.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
At rising, it does
not illuminate.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:90%
At setting, no darkness ensues.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It stretches far back to
that nameless state which

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
existed before the creation.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Describe it as
form yet unformed,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
as shape that is
still without shape,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:90%
or say it is vagueness confused.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
One meets it, and
it has no front.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
One follows it, and
there is no rear.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you hold ever fast
to this most ancient way,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
you may govern today.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Call truly this knowledge
of primal beginnings, a clue

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:90%
to the way.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:84%
You can open your
eyes and relax.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:90%
