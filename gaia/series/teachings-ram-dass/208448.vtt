00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a practice
that I do for example,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the
Tibetan tradition,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:90%
the Dzogchen tradition.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the practices that
I do is to lie on my back

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and look at the sky.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I see this vast sky,
and then every now and then,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
a plane goes over, a bird
flies into my vision,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:90%
the clouds come and clouds go.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's the sky, and all
these things are in the sky,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
but the sky is just there
and they come and go.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing
is I see all that

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:90%
as a mirror of consciousness.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.495 align:middle line:90%
And consciousness is the sky.

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And into the sky arise phenomena
and they come and they exist

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and they dissolve and they
turn into something else.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's easy to have
a phenomena out there,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
but then the phenomena of
the experience of the body.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The phenomena of
your own existence.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
These start to be just
arising moments of thought

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and passing moments
of thought, and you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:90%
keep coming back into the sky.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Until pretty soon, the
phenomena aren't arising to you,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena are
an internal matter.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
You're just at rest in being.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And internally,
phenomena are arising,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
transforming,
changing, dissolving,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and there's no clinging to it.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's there and it's not there.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't even care.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the equality
of awareness, it's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:84%
like a feeling of total presence
in which the trees are present

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and the wind is present
and our minds are present,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's all part of one
presence and that presence is.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.414 align:middle line:90%

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you go from one
of those places to another,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
it's not like your
ego disappears

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.900 align:middle line:90%
or your soul disappears.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you change
perspective about them.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like you thought you
were a star, pull back,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and so now you're
lying on your back

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
looking up at the Milky Way.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Of millions of stars of which
you are just another one.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm living my life, and when
people say, thank you so much,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and I say, it was
nothing personal.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't do it for
you, I did it because I do it.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to have
the issue of gratitude

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
if you don't get trapped in it.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But you can use
gratitude to poor me

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and wonderful you to get it.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the awareness and watching
the freshness of the creativity

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
every moment, including your
life and what you're doing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and who you think you are
and what you're about.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
standing in the place

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
where you're seeing
your own life

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
as your ultimate creative
act, come on a prayer.
