00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RAM DASS: When
someone is using a mala

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and reciting japa, meaning
the name of God, doing mantra,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
this is an auditory technique
of bringing you back

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
into that heart cave,
back into the hridaya,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual heart.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
On and on goes the mantra.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Om mani padme hum is such a
widely used mantra in Tibet.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.460 align:middle line:84%
There are millions
of prayer wheels.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And inside, written a million
times in tiny little letters,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:90%
is, Om mani padme hum.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And you very often
see a Tibetan woman.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
She'll have her prayer wheel in
one hand, which, with a twist,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:90%
she keeps it going around.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And in her left hand,
she'll have her mala.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:90%
On the back is her baby.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:90%
On the head are her vegetables.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And on her face is a big smile.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Even though her belly is empty,
she's just completely centered

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:90%
going down the mountainside.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:03.905 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
At the temples, around the
center, around the stupa,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
there are huge wheels--
some of them as big as 12,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:90%
15 feet high.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk around, keep
walking around the stupa,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and from 4 o'clock
on, the Tibetan monks

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
are just walking
around the stupa.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:90%
(CHANTING) Om mani padme hum.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And as they walk, they're
hitting the wheels.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And the wheels are going
around and around and around.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the wheels
whirring in the morning.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's semi dark.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
100 voices.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:90%
(CHANTING) Om mani padme hum.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And the wheels are going around.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you walk out
of the countryside.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're following a little
path back into the hills.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.035 align:middle line:90%
And you come to a stone.

00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And covering the entire thing
in the tiniest little writing,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.547 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So for the first day or
two, it was out there.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Then it started to be subvocal.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And then what it felt like
was as if it was a big bucket.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And it would go down into that
great big bowl of ambrosia.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And it would dip into the
bucket of ambrosia each time,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and it would pull up.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It started in the manipura,
in the third chakra,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:90%
right down in the stomach.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Om came up.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.838 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It's pronounced H-N-U-N-G. With
the back of the nose closed.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it right,
it vibrates in your chin.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
You go, hum.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then one night, I
lay down to go to sleep.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And all day long, I've been
saying Om mani padme hum.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I lay down.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I closed my eyes.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I was in the
midst of a chorus of voices

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.985 align:middle line:84%
that stretched that way and
that way and back in time

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension as far
as I could hear and could see.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And this chorus of voices
was old as time itself.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And it shook me up.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It was an extraordinary chorus.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And it went on
for several hours.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked my guru
brother what that was,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
he said, you tuned
in on the omkaar.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
O-M-K-A-A-R. You tuned in
on the eternal sound of om

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:90%
in the akasha.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:90%
In the ether.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:90%
You tuned in on higher sound.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You started to hear the
divine sounds of the universe.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's after
experiences of that nature

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and having met so
many monks that you

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand what a
powerful device a mantra is.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.056 align:middle line:90%
