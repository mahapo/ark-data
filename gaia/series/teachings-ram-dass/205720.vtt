00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
- Once you have recognized
what this game of evolution

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is about, the evolution of God
away from God and back to God,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
once you understand
what you're doing here

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, the meaning of your
every act starts to change.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
your whole life is

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
designed towards awakening,
because you understand that

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
only in your own liberation from
your attachments and clingings,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
not your responsibilities or
your incarnation or your love,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
but from the
clinging and grabbing

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that only in that freedom lies
the cessation of suffering.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when you do
as Christ admonished you to,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
know the Father, not talk
about him, not just pray to him

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
but open yourself to become it,
only then will the whole thing

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%
fall into place.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing else to do.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:84%
There isn't any
other game in town.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you
can offer me that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:90%
holds a candle to this process.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
In order to go this
journey, you finally

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
demand of yourself
the discipline

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
of body, heart, and mind.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The quiet mind, that's
why you meditate.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
The open heart, that's
why you practice devotion.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The strong body, that's why
you need to concern yourself

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
with your way in which you
keep your body and maintain.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when the spirit
of God enters you,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able to withstand
the power and the intensity

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of love, the brightness, the
blinding brightness that would

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
wither you were
you not prepared.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of yoga
is the preparation

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to in truth become
the bride of God.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what your
births are about.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what this life is about.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Give up the guilt. Give
up the unworthiness.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Give up the self-pity.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Give up the anger.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Give up the greed.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Give up the lust.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And every time you meet it
again, give it up again.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Here Christ, you take it.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what he went on
the cross for to take

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:90%
that stuff from you.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what Kali is there
for in the Hindu tradition

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:90%
to take that stuff from you.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what the guru is there
from the take it from you,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
but you got to
want to give it up.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You get to the
point in this game

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
where everything in you that is
keeping you from getting home

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:90%
you say forget it.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You are looking at a
map, and every side road

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
pretty the mountains

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
if it's not getting you home it
doesn't interest you anymore.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:84%
First rule, listen
to your inner voice.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The second rule, be
honest with yourself.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The predicament is that you
listen to your inner voice,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:90%
and it leads you to a path.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you outgrow
it, and you don't

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
want to admit you've
outgrown it, because you've

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:90%
made a big investment.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:10%
And you must be willing
to stand naked as

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:10%
a newborn child again and
again and again and again

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:10%
and again and again.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
The name of this
game is surrender.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:10%
Surrender of who
you think you are

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and where you think it all
is over and over again,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:10%
because what you
see from 1,000 feet

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:10%
is not what you
see from 2,000 feet

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:10%
and what you see from 3,000
feet, truth and trust.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And that trust in your inner
voice is based on the faith

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that there is a divine
law which guides you.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
When you look up,
when you say free me,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
God help me, that
action of raising a hand

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
or reaching out, that's man's
will is what elicits grace.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And grace is all of the
beings on other planes

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
or on this plane who are
there only specifically

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
to liberate you, but they
are not living in time.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's no rush from
where they're sitting.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to come get you.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:90%
You got to initiate the action.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Every morning at 4:00,
Buddha would look out

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
over all the Buddha
fields to see

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
who is ready for enlightenment.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Christ says with two or more
are gathered in my name,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:90%
there I am.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:90%
You got to call me, then I come.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the grace the
grace is drawn by you,

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's by you saying
I see my predicament.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to get out.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Help me.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Not with self-pity, but
I'm ready to be counted.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I am ready to stand
naked before God.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I am ready to come
to the father.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I ready to convert my
life so the whole process

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
is one of awakening.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I will lose myself 1,000
times into lust, greed, fear,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, et cetera, and 1001
times I will awaken and get up.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I won't waste time
in guilt and shame.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I'll just get on with it.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret
of the whole game.
