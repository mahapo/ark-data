00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Misunderstood right effort
is a driven "I've got to change"

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:84%
in which you get trapped
in trying, and yet,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
no effort is not harmonious
with the yearning for freedom

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.125 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling of the desire
to do the work on oneself.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So one is cultivating
and moving in and out

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
at first sequentially and
then, hopefully, more and more

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
That statement, "The
wise person does nothing,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and nothing is
left undone," it's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
that learning how to be between
effort and no effort that

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is such a delicate art
form, in which there

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.415 align:middle line:84%
are things being done, there
is effort made to change.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm with somebody,
and I feel myself

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
get caught in some habits of
interaction that are stuffy,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:90%
they're real.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, under certain conditions
I'd say to the person,

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
let's work this out,
let's get behind it.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
If the timing is
wrong when I do that,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
we are so invested
in those patterns

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that even as we
try to work it out,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.745 align:middle line:84%
we just keep substituting other
patterns and keep working.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
There is another timing where
it is so ripe that we can just,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:84%
recognizing the
caughtness, we start

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to let go because we're
both ready to let go.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Right effort has to do with
timing and hearing as well

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and feeling when that effort
is just absolutely appropriate,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to get
caught in making the effort.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just what needs to happen.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I had been on a long
tour, a lecture tour,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was very tired.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was in New
Mexico, and I was

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
in a sauna with some lovely
friends, a Tibetan nun,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And a telegram was
delivered to me.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And the telegram said, we
are holding a place for you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
for the Rohatsu Dai-Sesshin,
which starts on December 19.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%
This was December 17.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Rohatsu
Dai-Sesshin is the sitting

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in that sect of Zen
Buddhism that is

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
the fiercest one of the year.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Here, I was relaxing
in this hot tub.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It was all so sweet.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:10%
And here, they were these cold,
tight zen Buddhists 1,000 miles

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:10%
away, holding a space for me.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I read the telegram,
and I felt my way

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:84%
into this moment, the sauna, the
nun, the telegram, Mount Baldy,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
the airplane, the rushing,
and the opportunity

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to have nine or 11 days of
such incredible discipline

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and rigor.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And I found in me this
incredible yearning

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:90%
for that experience.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said to
everybody, excuse me.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.935 align:middle line:90%
I've just been called away.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I went into it, and it was hard.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It was really hard
because you got

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:90%
to keep going in to the Roshi.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And his technique is--

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
they give you a koan, you see.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
My koan was "How do
you know your Buddha

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
nature through the
sound of a pine tree?"

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So then you go in
and you report.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And you've been practicing what
you're going to say to him.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So you say something
like "listening."

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And he rings the bell,
and you're thrown out.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, my God."

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And this went on for five days.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Five days, and four times
a day, you got to do this.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was just
cutting me to shreds.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Finally, on the fifth day,
I was running a fever,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and I had chills, and I got so
disgusted with the whole thing.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I ran up, and I looked at
a bush, and it was burning,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.188 align:middle line:90%
and I thought a-ha.

00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:84%
He got all finished
with his routine,

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.503 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Good
morning, Roshi."

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
(MIMICKING ROSHI IN
JAPANESE ACCENT) "Now, you

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
becoming beginning
student of Zen."

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was interesting
that moment

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in the sauna where the pleasure
was beautiful and lovely,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
but that yearning for
something was so strong that I

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
would put myself in that
situation, knowing I

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:90%
was going into that.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say,
well, was it effort?

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It was and it wasn't.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It was the obvious.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like is falling
off a log effort?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it isn't when
your balance is right.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And it all has to do
with timing and balance,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
the way I can hear it, to get
that quality of right effort.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:90%
