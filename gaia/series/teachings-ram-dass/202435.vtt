00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Fear is the result of
getting caught in the middle.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Buddha says it's the
result of ignorance.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And the ignorance is
that when you start out

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.940 align:middle line:84%
as an infant with an
undifferentiated awareness,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and then you are
taught who you are,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that structure which we call
ego is a very fragile structure.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a structure
that is created

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
of learned neural patterns.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And it has on one
side of it what

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Freud referred to as the
id or the impulse life.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand is
this fragile structure

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
in the face of tremendous
forces externally,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:84%
which are parents, social
institutions, chaos

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and storms and
nature, all of it,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and if you can sense
the way that works,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
just see on one side of you
these extremely powerful

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
impulses in you
that you're afraid

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of and on the other side the
tremendous forces outside

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're afraid of
and feeling yourself

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
as a very fragile entity
within that structure.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:84%
When you didn't
have a framework,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
when you didn't have
a "somebody-ness,"

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
you are just part
of the universe.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's no fear so
that the root of the fear

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:90%
is the separateness.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The root of the fear is the
model one has of oneself.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:90%
That's where the fear starts.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Once that exists, then
you process everything

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.310 align:middle line:84%
from inside or outside
in terms of that model.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps reinforcing the
feeling of vulnerability.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, there
are incredibly powerful

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:90%
forces outside and inside.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The transformative
process of spiritual work

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is reawakening to the innocence
of going behind that model

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that one had that cut oneself
off, that made oneself

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
a tiny, little,
fragile somebody.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
You say I'm afraid of
being socially shamed.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you are socially
shamed, it hurts.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And then here we still are.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
You're afraid of violence.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then if violence
happens, sure.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's scary and painful.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:90%
And then behind it, here we are.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Often, the fear
feeds upon itself.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost
afraid of the fear.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The fear is the thing rather
than what we're afraid of.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:90%
We're just afraid.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
See, in a therapeutics
tradition, what you usually do

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is try to figure out
what you're afraid of.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Another technique
is this witness

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
which merely sits with
the fear and tries

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
to get it before it
becomes so consuming

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:90%
that there's no space left.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The image I usually use is
you got a painting of a cloud,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
of a gray cloud
against a blue sky.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But you only had
one picture frame.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was little too small.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So what you did was you bent
the canvas around to frame it.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, you
lost all the blue sky.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So you ended up with
just a framed gray.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It fills the entire frame.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So when you look around, you say
I'm afraid, or I'm depressed.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.915 align:middle line:84%
If you enlarge the
frame so that it

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:84%
was a little--
even just a little

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
bit of that kind of
round thing of a cloud

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and a little blue space,
you'd say, ah, a cloud.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what the witness is.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The witness is that
tiny, little blue

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
over in the corner that
leads you to say, ah, fear.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Often, we get so frightened,
we can't stop for a moment

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
to notice, ah, there's fear
because it's consumed us.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So the art is to keep
cultivating that witness,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:84%
continuously cultivating it
in all the opportunities you

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
have so that it is present
more and more of the time.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you focus
on the witness

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
rather than on the fear,
you see that there's

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
a part of you that is not
afraid but just noticing.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
The noticer isn't judging.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not trying to change it.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not even afraid.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It's just noticing.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, recognizing that
there is a part of you that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
always exists that is not
afraid and in the deeper,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
mystical sense or transformative
or spiritual sense,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
there is indeed a part of
you that is always not afraid

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
because there is a part of
you that was never separate.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
How could you be afraid?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
You are everything.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:90%
What could you be afraid of?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
All it is transformation
of energy.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a tree
falling and then rotting

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and then providing nurturance
for everything else

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
in the forest and going on.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And the tree isn't upset
about its change of state.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It is the process of death.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You're just seeing
transformation of energy.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Because once you get back
into the mystical root

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
being, your true
self, it doesn't

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
die because it wasn't born.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's always a
place that is not afraid.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what one works
to find in one's self.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
