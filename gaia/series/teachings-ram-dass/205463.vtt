00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The guru trip is a
really hard one for the West

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand, because it's
really a play of soul not

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
of ego, although we make
it into quite an ego trip.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The teacher is somebody who
is working on themselves

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and who points the
way because they've

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
heard there is
something down the road,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and they're pointing the way.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So a guru is in a way
like the door frame.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Because what is it that
the guru is a vehicle to?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The guru is a
vehicle to yourself.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The guru is a vehicle to that
which is beyond guru certainly.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a doorway through
which you keep meeting

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:90%
the unbeatable, the mystery.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a doorway into the mystery.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
In India, they say
God, guru, and self

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:90%
are one and the same thing.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of the nature
of individual karma,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
some people meet
that form that way.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Some people meet it that way.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people meet it that way.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many people who
have guidance on astral planes.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They have beings that
come and talk to them.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that a guru?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:90%
It may be and it may not be.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Just like somebody on this
plane may be and may not be.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
A guru from the Satguru
is somebody who is nobody.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody saying I'm the
guru, because who would that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:90%
be?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm the door frame, you know?

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean what happened to me
was that I met this being.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And what happened emotionally
and intellectually

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
was some doorway
opened inside of me.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And I allowed the possibilities.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.356 align:middle line:84%
I experienced something
that allowed a possibility.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I could say, in one
way of looking at it,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that I was ripe for
that experience.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was like a
being that was sent

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to do that so that I
could resonate against it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.732 align:middle line:90%
and find nobody home.

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Because in all the years I knew
him, I kept looking for him

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and he was never there.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because whoever I thought
he was, he wasn't.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And he played with
my mind all the time.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Many of you know the stories.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.862 align:middle line:84%
Like I thought he had all these
powers, and he saw everything,

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and he knew everything.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
He threw me out all the time
when I was in the temple.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
He let other people hang around,
but he always threw me out.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I felt
really put upon.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean my ego was
really crushed.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would he let other
people stay and throw me out?

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
People I had brought
to him, you know?

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
was when he died,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
all the people that
had hung around him

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
were completely
decimated by his death.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have his form
anyway most of the time.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So he and I were moving
to another plane anyway.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't miss
the forum so much.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But what I felt
was the qualities

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that I had known through
him-- the qualities of humor,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of rascality,
the qualities of wisdom,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of emptiness,
the qualities of compassion,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
the qualities of love.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And so I'd feel those qualities.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way
I connected with him.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And then those
qualities just got

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve into just
a sense of presence.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just a sense of presence
I'm sitting in right now.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind,
the information I

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
need to keep that connection is
in the presence of the moment.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that
I'm dissolving into him,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or I'm becoming Maharaji,
or he's turning me into--

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
all that's too
astrally melodramatic.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
All I can feel is that he and
I are aimed in the same place.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Where he truly is, I am truly
becoming to be, as you are.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
surrender into that,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
the more we are
all home together.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:90%
We are just at home.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I watched after he died that
the people who had met him,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
their lives went in terribly
complicated and very often

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
a lot of suffering ways.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there were people
that met him through books.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And I watched their lives be
turned around by his presence.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So I realized, then,
that you didn't have

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
to be in his form to see it.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
You still got what you got.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I now see that you can
take one of those pictures,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
like the picture of Maharaji,
or the picture of Anandamayi Ma,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and you just sit with
it, and allow that being

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
to be with you, and a lot
starts to happen to people.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I meet people who have never
had a guru in physical form

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.905 align:middle line:84%
and who don't have
great beliefs in God,

00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
but who have delved so
deeply into their own beings

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that we meet just in
presence together.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:90%
