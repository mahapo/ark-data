>> For there is suffering
but none who suffers.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Doing exists although
there is no doer.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Extinction is but no
extinguished person.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Although there is a path
traveled, there is no goer.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So what we are talking about
in this method of wisdom,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
or in all methods of yoga,
is extricating oneself

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
from the attachment
to the illusion

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
of a permanent somebody
doing something in the world.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Getting one free of doing a take
of yourself in nature, being

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
attached to the gunas, or
the threads that compose

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.045 align:middle line:90%
the physical plane world.

Lovely line by Ramana Maharshi.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
If it is said that
liberation is of three kinds,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
with form or without
form, then let me tell you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that the extinction of the
three forms of liberation

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:90%
is the only true liberation.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But you keep having mind models
about where you're going.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the models
themselves have to go too.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.389 align:middle line:84%
Because as Ram Kir said, "a
god defined is a god confined."

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
If you follow these mind methods
through, a number of things

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.775 align:middle line:84%
One is you begin to sense a
deeper way of knowing things.

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
come into what we've

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
been calling intuition
or an intuitive relation

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
hard for somebody

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that is used to
knowing what they know

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
as objective knowledge
to deal with,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
what this intuitive grasp is.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an inner feeling of, yeah,
right that's the way it is.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And my first knowledgeable
memory experience

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:84%
of this where I honored it
all because of its validity

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and power was the first
time I took psilocybin.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But when that happened,
when I was ripped away

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
from being the knower
of objective knowledge

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the entire world
outside or from outside,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.835 align:middle line:84%
even thinking of
myself as an object--

00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
when I got into this inner
space, the power of it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
was such that there is
a part of me that never

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.255 align:middle line:90%
returned from that moment.

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The experience itself
had such a powerful sense

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
of validity to it that
there wasn't a chance

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that it was going to
be completely lost back

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
into the Akash.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, almost
by definition,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
what brings everybody
into this room

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that at
some level or other,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
this thing has happened
to each being here.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It may not have happened by
any method you can even label.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe for some
of you, all because

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of your particular karma all
the way through your life,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
you've been flipping in
and out of these things.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But every time you got
into one of these spaces,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.875 align:middle line:90%
you labeled yourself as insane.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:90%
Because it didn't fit in.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't along with the
total conspiracy of mind

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.762 align:middle line:90%
that we call our culture.

00:04:28.762 --> 00:04:31.738 align:middle line:90%

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And once this awareness of
another identity in one's self

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:84%
has occurred, then the whole
meaning of worldly desires

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:90%
starts to change.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
That's our predicament.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:90%
You see, that's the one.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
To he who knows, no
explanation is necessary.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:84%
To he who doesn't,
none is possible.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly the kind of
wisdom we're playing with now.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We're really talking about a
discontinuity of consciousness.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the predicament.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
You are living totally in
this most grotesque illusion.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if once this,
quote, "thing" happens to you,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
once there is the breakthrough,
once you have started

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to experience another way
of relating to the universe,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
then the way you have
built up the model of how

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
you would relate were you
who you think you are--

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
once this thing
breaks through, you

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.960 align:middle line:84%
are literally never
the same again.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Because though you are
back in the illusion

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and you will get sucked into
thinking it's real many times,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.585 align:middle line:90%
a seed has been planted.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:90%
