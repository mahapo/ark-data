00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:19.305 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The awakening could be
said to be the moment when you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
realize you're in prison, the
moment when you experience

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
another reality, the moment when
you see there are other ways

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.147 align:middle line:90%
of looking at it all.

00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about other
places in your thought

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%
process--

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:90%
but other.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Now what you call
that place from which

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you look at your life
when before you were just

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
busy thinking you were
it, your incarnation life,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:90%
where do you look at it from?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're
using the word "soul."

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at the
soul's predicament.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The soul had some karma to
work out, took an incarnation,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
got lost in the
incarnation, and then

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
starts to awaken and
realize that it has just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
taken an incarnation.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And it had to get lost and
go through the whole process

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:10%
of awakening for the
incarnation to work out

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:10%
the karma, which you created or
which is the manifest of what

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:10%
your karma needs.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's all fine.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no errors.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just interesting.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God, have I been had.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that big at all.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So from the soul's point of
view, as you start to awaken,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
you see the way in which the
incarnation sticks to you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
as you're sort of
shaking it off,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
like shaking off water
or stuff like that.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a tendency
because you've

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
been trapped in the incarnation
for so long, when you awaken,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to see it in negative terms.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:90%
It trapped me.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It's thick.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:90%
It's something.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
And you push against it.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like the renunciate path.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I just will push away life.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.852 align:middle line:84%
I will push away incarnation,
and then I will soar as a soul.

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
want to get high,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and I want to push away the low.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And low and high are still
seen as value things,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that higher is
better than lower.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Higher, I feel connected
to the universe.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel I'm in my soul.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Lower, I come down back into
my psychodynamic, social,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
physical, somebody's
specialness, trapped back here

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The curriculum of the soul
has two components to it.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:90%
They're really interesting.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:10%
First of all, it's working
with its incarnation,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:10%
and it sees, ultimately, that
Buddha was absolutely right on,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:10%
that the clinging of mind, the
attraction, and the aversions

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:10%
of mind are what juiced
the whole system,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:10%
and the suffering,
and the whole shtick.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So the soul is using the
experiences of incarnation

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
to get lost in, then
to awaken out of,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to see one's predicament,
and to get to the point

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
where one can be, as
Christ said, in the world

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
but not of the world.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You are not pushing
away your incarnation

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:90%
because that's an aversion.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
The versions are
from the ego level.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Soul doesn't have aversions.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The soul just sees aversions
and attractions within the ego.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Every time you're identified
with an attraction

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
or an aversion, you're
identified with your ego.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So the job of extricating
oneself into one's soul

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
is slowly cultivating
those qualities

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
which allow you to
see the whole process

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and to calm yourself
into realizing

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that your incarnation is
about extricating yourself

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
from attractions and
aversions so that you are not

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
lost in incarnation anymore.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The game is to go beyond
that into the point where

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
you are fully in the world
and fully not in the world.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
There are stages where you get
into your soul where you say,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
oh, I miss the passions of
life, meaning the passions,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
the excitements that were
caused by being lost in it.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And you think, I'll
never have those again.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll never have
my first romance.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll never have this,
and I'll never have that.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Because those were so
adrenaline-rushy, heady stuff.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot like
what is often called

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.898 align:middle line:90%
the "Dark Night of the Soul."

00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We have sort of
realized that you're not

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
going to have the intensity
of the excitement that

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:84%
came from being totally
lost into the linear drama

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing
how it comes out.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:90%
It all comes out the same.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.102 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] It all turns
back into whatever it is.

00:04:56.102 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] That's the
transitory nature of phenomena,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:90%
whether you like it or not.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
