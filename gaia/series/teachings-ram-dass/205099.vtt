00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if each and every one
of us is this extraordinarily

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
precious conversion vehicle
for bringing spirit into form.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.420 align:middle line:84%
If we get caught in form,
so that our whole minds are

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:84%
stuck in form, then we don't
turn it back into spirit.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And at first, we are
very intentionally

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.317 align:middle line:84%
doing things like
breathing up into the head,

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and then down into the
body, and up into the head,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.567 align:middle line:90%
and then down into the body.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:90%
These are methods.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Until after a while,
you are so much,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
as the Bible says, "in the
world but not of the world,"

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
that every situation
you come into

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
is one into which you
bring that kind of light,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and peace, and presence,
love, compassion.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And it gets so that you're
really not doing anything.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You have merely
surrendered to becoming

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.675 align:middle line:90%
an instrument of that process.

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's not even
the conscious intent,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:90%
like I'm doing it.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It is merely being
done through you,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you start to live
in the most extraordinarily

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.875 align:middle line:90%
different kind of a world.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
For me, when I am resting in
the space of being, of God,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, and I am just
going through life looking

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
at my beloved, it's like walking
through a garden in which

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
everywhere you look the
flowers keep blooming

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:90%
right before your very eye.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Because almost
every human being,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
when they are touched by love
or light or spirit that is not

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
judging, that doesn't
want anything,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not asking for
anything in return,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.065 align:middle line:84%
they respond and they just
open just a little better.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
watching a flower bloom.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:84%
See, most of us are so
vulnerable that if you allow

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
yourself to open that way and
you look at someone with love

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and they look at you
like, what do you want,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you are so in the world yet
that you buy their mind.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh,
nothing, nothing, and you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
close right back up
like a clam, a muscle.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
When you have quieted and
deepened your connection

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to that which is the most
profound in the universe,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
then when people in the world
reject or turn off or give you

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that glassy eyed thing, you're
crazy, you allow them to do it,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
diminish your love,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.167 align:middle line:84%
because you, it turns
out, are not vulnerable.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Catch you with your
love hanging out?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
How terrible, how
embarrassing for you.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:90%
I'll love you if you love me.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't that game anymore.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Your only friend is God.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you
don't have friends,

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:90%
but it means the essence.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all
the different friends

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
you have and you look at
what the essence of it is,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
it's that place inside where
the two of you meet in love.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:90%
That's God.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:90%
That's it, that's spirit.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
