00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> For those of you that
really appreciate touching

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of the compassion
of your heart would find that

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances tend to
make you protect your heart.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to just
look around where you are

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and listen and find a way
in which you can reach out

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to be there for someone
else, but the practice

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of kindness of
compassionate action

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
is something that draws
you out of yourself.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I find that because of
what I have projected out,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
people will come to me and
present something extremely

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
pressing, and profound,
and deep, quickly,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
like the loss of a child
or something like that.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I can be standing there
filled with my own self, stuff,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
inadequacy, arrogance,
insecurity, studying,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:90%
planning, whatever it is.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I find that the realness
of their demand on my heart

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:90%
demands that I let go.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It pulls me out of myself.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
opportunity to be with children

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is reaching
out, to be with elders, to be

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
with the sick, to be with
people in any way disadvantaged,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:90%
it pulls you out of yourself.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It pulls you into yourself.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
It pulls you into the
deeper truth of your being,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
because at that
point, what can you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
offer that other person other
than the purest thing you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
have to offer?

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
How could you offer any less?

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:90%
How could you do it?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me being in
the Saver Foundation,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
for example, because
of the nature

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
of what a foundation
that is there

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to try to relieve
a little suffering

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is like, you become much more
aware of the massive nature

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
of suffering.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reactions to that, at
first, it's so overwhelming.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:90%
You want to hide.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to go
into denial again.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And then when you hold
hands with each other

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and you get so that
you can stay open

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
facing the inability of you
to take away all suffering.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Most people are afraid that
if they look at what is they

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:90%
will break.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It'll be too much for you.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it is too much
for who you think you are.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It is not too much
for who you are.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I invite you to open to
the suffering of the universe,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you can
only do what you can do.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And that if you do what
you can do, but only

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of frustration,
because you can't do more,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
what you are transmitting with
the very thing you are doing

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
is that frustration.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
While if you're
quiet, you see the web

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:90%
of suffering in the universe.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
You see yourself.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You see all the
others, you see the web

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of compassion in the universe.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm on the good guy
mailing list just like you.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.123 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds and
hundreds of requests for help.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I go through
them, and there's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:84%
no rational way I can
decide, no way I can do that.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And I let my responses
change from year to year.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:90%
I just feel my way through.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And one of them pulls.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
doesn't, but I know

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
that that one pulled for me.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And that one pulled
for someone else.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And that we are part of
the family of compassion.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
