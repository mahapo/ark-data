00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Every person will have a
story about a moment of that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
recognition that things
aren't the way they seem.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
That the conceptual model that
you and I became conspirators

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to about what is
reality is actually

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
this fragile, fragile veil we
put up against the unknown.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we put it up
really out of fear,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
we make it impermeable
out of fear.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
What seems to have
gotten screwed up

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.243 align:middle line:90%
is the balance in us.

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
That you started
out when you were

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
born with this
undifferentiated self.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
There weren't a boundary saying
this is me and that's other.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
That was something you learned.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fact that you
learned it was necessary.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And you learned it and
it had a genetic origin,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
it had a environmental origin
because your parents all

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
thought they were somebody,
and they went, took you

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:90%
into somebody training.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was part of
the culture you lived in.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And they thought,
I'll train my child

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to be somebody, that's the
best thing I can do for them.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And the more special you are,
the better somebody you are.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So you and I got trained
into somebody specialness,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
because this is a culture
of somebodys where

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
your identity is with
your individuality,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
not your identity as part
of the unity of things.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's interesting
that people are waking up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to their interdependence, while
other cultures always lived

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%
with their interdependence.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans always
knew they were interdependent.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
The balance that got off
was that we started out

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
with this undifferentiated
self and we so well learned

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
our separateness that
our separateness veiled

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
over the connection we had
to the unity of all things.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.142 align:middle line:84%
Once we awaken to realize
you're part of everything,

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:34.975 align:middle line:84%
that it's all relative
reality, that there's

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
a something behind it all,
it's all one God, whatever

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
metaphor you want to use,
you're awakening back

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:90%
into the balance.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And at first, when you
recognize that there's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
a unity behind the diversity,
the whole awakening metaphor

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
tends to pull you towards
pushing away at the diversity

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and grabbing at the unity
because you've lost it so far

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and you want to taste
it again, because when

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.605 align:middle line:84%
you experience the unity, you
feel at home in the universe.

00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But then you realize that to
just acknowledge the unity,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the
non-conceptual part

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
of your identity, to
acknowledge your divinity

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and to push away your
diversity, to push away

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
your incarnation as a separate
entity, that's imbalance, too.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And you then begin to
see the exquisiteness

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of the human incarnate; the
potential of, as Christ said,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
being in the world, but not
of the world; the potential

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of being fully yourself as
a diverse, unique entity

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and fully everything; that
you and I have the capacity

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to live on more than one plane
of reality simultaneously.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And the predicament is that
part of our identity, which

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is known by our senses
and our thinking mind,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
those parts have
fascinated us so much

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that they are like loud trumpets
that have overwhelmed us

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
so that we haven't heard what
the Quakers call the still

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
small voice within, which is
that part of ourselves which

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
is not object, but
which is subject.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like the flashlight, which
you shine on this and that

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, it's that,
oh, it's that, oh, it's that.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing the flashlight
can't do is shine on itself.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So that you never see
that which is seeing.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So that part of you that is
just the seer, the wisdom,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
the source, the
subject, you never

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:84%
notice it because
it's not noticeable.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It is just be-able.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.272 align:middle line:90%
