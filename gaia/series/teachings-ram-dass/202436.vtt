00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We each have a
set of experiences.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Around those experiences,
we create a scenario

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
or a storyline of
who we think we are

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and how we think it all is.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you,
there's no scenario

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
you've created about
your own life that

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.940 align:middle line:90%
is anywhere near how it is.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I know that when
I was at Harvard,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I had absolutely no
conception not only of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
how my life would turn out
in the external forms of it

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
but of what I would be
experiencing now as a being.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what I experience
myself to be now

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is so entirely different than
what I experienced myself

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to be 16 years ago, not
just that I had a younger

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
body and all that, I
mean a profound change

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, in what
I see in the world, what

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I see in myself,
what I feel, how

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I deal with every
situation that comes up.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody
said to me in 1963

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you don't even begin to
know what your life's going

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
to be about, you have
no idea who you are,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I had already written
the scenario then.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:90%
And that scenario was a crock.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It never had anything to
do with how it turned out.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I have
written hundreds of scenarios.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And they've all been wrong.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And there comes a
point where you just

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:90%
stop writing scenarios.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Like the scenario I'm a mother,
and then your child is gone.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly you're not a mother.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.015 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm a wife or a husband,
and suddenly your partner's

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:90%
is separate.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm healthy, and suddenly
you find out you have cancer.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Scenario, let go, new scenario,
new scenario, new scenario,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:90%
new scenario.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And all the time behind
it is lurking just

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
this unfolding of law, just
the working out of stuff.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when you're very
quiet inside, at least for me,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very quiet, I can
almost see the clock ticking.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:90%
I can almost see it working.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I can almost see how many times
I have to go through this.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But if it's something,
it's still something.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I got to keep going through
it until it isn't anything.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't do it this life,
I'll do it in another life.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
The situation you are in
at this moment, whatever

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:90%
it is, whatever it is--

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.795 align:middle line:84%
this is one that's so hard for
people to hear, for me to hear.

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy to forget.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
The situation you are in at
this moment whatever it is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely perfect.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And it boggles the
mind to see billions

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
of beings having billions of
life's situations every moment.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And it all is within law.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And if I understand
the game that as you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
get lighter and clearer
and less attached,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
you create less
and less new karma,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that karma is created
by every action that

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
has attachment to it or a
desire or a clinging or intent.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you stop needing
to act out of your desires.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
The desires are there,
and you are here.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And action happens.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then new karma
stops being created.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And all that results is
old karma just runs off.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And very often,
you see beings who

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
finished who aren't around
except for maybe a thread.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And all it's there is this
old karma running off.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea about my guru.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Was he beyond karma?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Was he working out old karma?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Was he finished?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
How would I know?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:90%
You only see what you can see.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't know one
if I stepped on it.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've stopped
asking about myself

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:90%
when will I get enlightened?

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I stopped counting
and measuring.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just an unfolding, and
I'm just a part of a process.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of patience now.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And I am merely seeing
that the means and the ends

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:90%
are all interwoven.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just a mosaic that's
just unfolding before my eye.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And the quieter I get
and the lighter I get,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:90%
the more it all gets clearer.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%
