00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Now perhaps the biggest fear
of aging is the fear of death.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
you are identified

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
with your separateness and
you think that's what you are,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:90%
you will have fear.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you cultivate
the part of you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that is not identified
with your separateness,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
you will have a place in
you that is not afraid,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as the place
in you that is afraid.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a balancing
of those things.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you might even
get light enough.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
A zen monk is dying and his
students say to him, master,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
you haven't written
your death poem yet.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I haven't
written my death poem.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And he grabs the brush and
he calligraphies madly,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:90%
and he dies.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:90%
And it says birth is thus.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Death is thus.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Verse or no verse,
what's the fuss?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
My guru was walking with
one of his old devotees

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:90%
and he started to laugh.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the old devotee said,
what are you laughing about?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, well so-and-so, this
old woman devotee just died.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And the friend said, what
are you laughing about?

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
What are you some
kind of a butcher?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And Maharaji said
to him, would you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
like me to make believe
it's all that real?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is,
where does somebody go?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When I sit with that mystery,
all the experiences I've had,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have a
flicker of anything other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
than an appreciation that
when we drop our body,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:90%
we just drop our body.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Ramana Maharshi is
dying and the people

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:90%
say, don't leave, don't leave.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And he says, don't be silly.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Where could I go?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just a shift of form.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you have loved
somebody in the love

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
that transcends form,
even for a moment,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
you and they aren't
going anywhere.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Your mind may say they've gone.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's your mind.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The minute you quiet down
and go back into your heart,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
they're right there again.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And love really does
transcend death.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:84%
There's not even a doubt
in my mind about it.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.265 align:middle line:84%
And you remember what
I said to Emmanuel?

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Emmanuel, what shall I
tell people about dying?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, tell them
it's absolutely safe.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's like
taking off a tight shoe.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Buddha said, do you
know how many times

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
you have taken birth like this?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, imagine a mountain
6 miles long, 6 miles wide,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and 6 miles high.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And every 100 years a bird
flies over the mountain

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:10%
with a silk scarf in its beak.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:10%
And it runs the scarf across the
mountain once every 100 years.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
In the length of time
it would take the scarf

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
to wear away the mountain,
that's how long you've

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:90%
been doing this.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It sure gives you a different
perspective, doesn't it,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
about time and the
meaning of a life?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Can you see a life as so
precious and beautiful,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and still learn how
to hold on tightly,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
let go lightly, how
to not cling to it,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
how to be open to the mystery,
and open to the next part

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
of it, by saying, OK, and
now this, and now this?

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.655 align:middle line:84%
In the Tibetan tradition
when you're dying,

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
you are trained to
stay in the moment.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the
model, I am dying,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
you are just in the moment.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:90%
The Earth element leaves.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You notice heaviness.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
The water element leaves.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
You notice dryness.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
The fire element leaves.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:90%
You notice coldness.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
The air element leaves.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
You notice the outbreath is
longer than the inbreath.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Just moment, moment, moment,
now this, now this, now this.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I have been sitting now
with dying people for 10--

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
15 years I guess.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
that it is the richest

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:90%
experience of my life.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:90%
It is such incredible grace.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The two things that awaken
the same feelings in me

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.022 align:middle line:84%
are being present at a birth
and being present at a death.

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment
of death, when

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:10%
you feel the awareness
leave the body,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and when that
person's connection

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:10%
to that which is
beyond their body

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:10%
is deep enough because they
have relaxed the mind that

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:10%
keeps grabbing at
their separateness,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:10%
so that they can just
let go very gently.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:90%
There's not even a ripping.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
There's not a pushing.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:90%
There's not a grabbing.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.505 align:middle line:84%
The whole secret is to live
this moment fully, now this one,

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
now this one.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
this one, how do you

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:84%
know the next one may
be the one you die in?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
The best preparation
for your dying

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.658 align:middle line:84%
is that you live this moment
now, fully, moment by moment.

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then one of them will
be the one in which you

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
drop your body, and it'll just
be another moment, nothing

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
special.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not really that dramatic.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:10%
We milk it so much,
such a big drama.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.472 align:middle line:84%
Will he die, or won't
he die, should she die?

00:05:45.472 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Sure, we're all going to die.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you a secret.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:90%
You're all going to die.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But though you perish,
you will not die.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The whole secret is of
extricating yourself

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
from identification with form,
because all form corrupts.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It all dies.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:90%
You take care of it.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:90%
You honor it.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:90%
You clean it up.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
You keep it healthy as
it is slowly corrupting.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Hold on tightly.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Let go lightly.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:90%
