00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me that this
spiritual journey is a process

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:90%
of tuning very, very slowly.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like diving.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.297 align:middle line:84%
You have to acclimate at
each level of depth of water.

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And at each level, you're
getting different information,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
which leads you to a
different conclusion.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So you get down 2 feet,
and you look around,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and you see a beautiful
fish, and you say that's God.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And you follow that fish.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.335 align:middle line:84%
And then as you get acclimated,
you're able to then go deeper.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you
go deeper, you look,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.585 align:middle line:84%
and the whole universe
looks different.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole new fish
to look at that attracts you.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, as you go
into the spiritual journey

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
along the way, you shouldn't be
afraid to jump into a method,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and you shouldn't be afraid,
if the method feels like you're

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
done with it, to go on.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Now there are other times when
your inner feeling will say,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I've gone as far as I can go
with this method at this level,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and what I'd really like to do
is go deeper in this method.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'll make a kind of a
renewed effort to go deeper.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
That is information that
only you have, really.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can tell
you how to do that.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people that are
committed to their path

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, you've done
a wise thing to come to me

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.285 align:middle line:90%
and follow my path.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, well, I don't
know whether to go deeper in it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:90%
or leave.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
They say, we'll go deeper,
because of their commitment,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
unless they are very wise
beings, in which they will say,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:90%
listen to your own heart.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You will find that your karmic
predicament will pull you

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
to a path sooner or later.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And you will feel
at a certain point

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the nonsense of looking
here and there is all over.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:90%
I've found my way through.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
Some people will be very drawn
to working with their minds

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
to quieting their minds.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll get to a point
where their mind is reasonably

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
quiet like a lot of my friends
who are Vipassana meditators.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They go, and they
follow their breath.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.512 align:middle line:84%
And they follow
Joseph to Hawaii,

00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and they follow their breath.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And then they go to Switzerland,
and they follow their breath.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And they go to Barry, and
they follow their breath.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And they get to be master
Vipassana meditators.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
feel that there's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
something in them screaming
that isn't getting fed.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
They can't break through to
the next level by that method.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.927 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, some of
them just blow sky high.

00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They leave Vipassana,
and they go out,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and they have mad love
affairs, and they smoke dope,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and they do all kinds of stuff.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And then some time later,
either they go back to Vipassana

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
from a new level or they
found another method.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Either way, you don't know.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Other people get to
Vipassana, and they

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.855 align:middle line:84%
get to that sticky
place, and they just say,

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to do a three-month meditation.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And they go in.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And for the first two months,
it's just like it was before,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
but there's a way in which
they are so one-pointed and so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:90%
determined, they come through.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.605 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they're
in a whole new place.

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you hear what I'm
saying, that there

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:84%
isn't a rule of thumb
about playing this game?

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.740 align:middle line:84%
You really just have to keep
listening from day to day.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:90%
