00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If I want to be part of
a relationship going to God,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:90%
my job is to keep free.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what I can offer
into the situation.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how nitty gritty
it happens with the partner,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:90%
your work is on yourself.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may have a
relationship with your partner

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
where you can say, you are
driving me up the wall.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing
what you need to do.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.088 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I'm climbing
the wall is my problem.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking for
anything from you.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We're just sharing
truth with one another.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:90%
You just keep the channels open.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
As Maharaji said
to me, do what you

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
do with another human being,
but never put them out

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.325 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And the only ones
you have to be scared

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of in one of these
volatile relationships

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the thing
that the other person

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.318 align:middle line:84%
does, which disconfirms your
model of how they should be--

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:84%
which is the only
thing that's making

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
you suffer in the first place--

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
that that thing,
you would rather

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
hold on to how you
think it should be,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:90%
than to deal with how it is.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And in order to hold on to
how you think it should be,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
you close your heart
to the other person.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the only one
to be concerned about.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And all you can do
with that point is

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
to say to the other person,
I've closed my heart to you.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Help me open it again.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And their help isn't that they
do what you want them to do,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
it is merely that they
appreciate that your heart is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
closed and they help
you with whatever love

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:90%
they have to help you with.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.118 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very volatile
and delicate stuff.

00:02:06.118 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are often
times when you'd rather

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:90%
run away than play again.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You just almost get
burned out from trying,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
because it almost seems as if
our personality dynamics that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
keep us locked in
these separatenesses

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
are stronger than our
desire for liberation.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
But patience and trust
and just goodwill

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and a real yearning
for God will keep you

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
of that fire and will

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
keep you letting go in yourself
again and again and again.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:90%
And you're surrendering to God.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
You're not surrendering to
the will of the other person.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
You're surrendering to God.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Most people want to want
to be free this lifetime.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.605 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be free.

00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you want to be
free, There's no pride,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:90%
there's no grudges.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Why would you hold on to anger?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to be free?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Anger is not going
to get you there.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you need it for?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Anything that doesn't
go, gets chunked.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You're ruthless with yourself
when you really want God.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When you just want
to want God, you just

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:84%
want to be somebody
who, in your own eyes,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
is going towards liberation.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I can be busy being
somebody that's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
been maligned, self-pity, anger,
feeling old, feeling whatever.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Or I can say, well, look
at all these feelings.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that far out.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:90%
And here I still am.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And it hurts like hell.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And the karma of the act
is in the other person.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
blaming or anything.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
All I can feel is compassion
if you get stuck in stuff.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is stay
there with my heart open.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, there's a new moment
and all that became irrelevant.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Such a delicate dance.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Such a delicate dance.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:90%
