00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> In practices, each of us is
the manifestation of a unique

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:90%
karmic predicament.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And that unique
karmic predicament

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:84%
has to do with balances of
mind, and heart, and energies.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
whole web and mosaic

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of the attachments, attractions,
and aversions of our mind.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And so from there, what
practice do you do to get free?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Well the answer
really is that there

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
is no rule book in this game.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
There is no one practice
that's going to work.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Each of us is in a
unique predicament.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
listen to hear what

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:90%
way is going to work for us.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize
that at different stages

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of our development,
different practices work.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
When you initially
start out, you often

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:90%
optimize your strong points.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're a person of heart,
you are attracted to singing

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:90%
to God.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Later on, you may
be drawn to working

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
with the fire of
the places which

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:84%
are really not the ones you've
led with in your personality.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, you go
to quiet the mind

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
even though you're
a devotional person.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I have been, as
you know, accused

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
many, many times of
eclecticism, which is often

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
treated as a dirty word.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean people like
Swami Satchidananda

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
has said you must not dig
a lot of shallow wells,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:90%
you must dig one well deeply.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And I hear him, and I
understand what he's saying.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't help myself.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
In my practice, which is Guru
Kripa or grace of the guru,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
how does that express
itself in form?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It's led me to take teachings
in various forms of meditation.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's led me to devotional
and ecstatic practices.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
It's led me to energy things.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
It's led me to working
with LSD and psychedelics.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I respect and
honor my inner truth

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
that guides me to what
practices I am drawn to.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And other people tell me
what they think I should do

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and I run that into
my intuitive heart,

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and I listen, and
I process, and then

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I do what I feel I need to do.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The closest I have to God
is in the deepest part

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:90%
of my intuitive heart.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to come
through anybody else's saying

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Even Maharaj Ji said many things
to me that I have never done.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But I felt them working
on me, and working on me,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:90%
and working on me.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if I imitated
or did what he told me,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I would end up imitating
something that I wasn't.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet at some
times, I practiced

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
by doing those
kinds of things just

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to see the nature of
the clinging of my mind.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
about practices,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
as I said the other day, is
that practices are traps.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And for them to work, you
must be trapped by them.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But any practice worth
its salt, ultimately,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
self-destructs to take
you beyond itself.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
go into it first.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You see the whole
journey you are on.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like the one who
wants enlightenment

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
comes right up to the gate
but never goes through.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Only nobody gets free.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we may have practices
that you do in the morning

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
before you meet the
people who won't

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:90%
understand what you're doing.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you might have
practices that you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
can keep in your pocket
or all kinds of practices.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, appreciate
that your entire life

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:90%
is your practice.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
At first it starts
out that I practice

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
on Sunday morning,
or Saturday night,

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
or every morning for 20
minutes, but ultimately

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
what else is there?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Because until you are free,
you are caught in suffering.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
As long as you are
caught in suffering,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
compassionate you are,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:84%
you cannot free
others from suffering.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the web of life

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and you open to your
identity with all of it,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the whole nature
of the suffering, the freedom

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
from suffering, the
cause of ignorance,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
when it's all
inside you, and you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
want to liberate others,
not out of personal desire

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
but just out of itself
liberating itself,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
then the work on the instrument
becomes what life is about.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.327 align:middle line:84%
And you feel joy in being
able to transform your life.

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So more and more, you see it
as a vehicle for awakening.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:90%
