00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:12.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I tell you that you really
have to expect your heart

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to open and close
like an accordion.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And when it closes,
it will open.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And when it opens, it
will probably close.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because behind closings
and openings, here we are.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
dramatizing your closed heart

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
or your open heart,
just allow it

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the
process of life,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and be patient with yourself.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it is very clear to me
that the shadow is the greatest

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
teacher of how to
come to the light.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't ask for suffering,
but when it comes along,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
it certainly turns
out to be grace,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm begrudging
it all the time it's there.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you and
I live in a world

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:10%
where it is hard to keep your
heart fully open because it

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:10%
hurts so bad, because
there's so much suffering.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But I would tell you you
can't afford to close it.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when it
becomes unbearable,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
then the choice you have when
something becomes unbearable

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is to protect yourself from
it because it's unbearable

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or to change who it is that
thinks it's unbearable.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I recommend this latter course.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:90%
If you can't bear it, bear it.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll find a whole
new interesting part

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
of your being, somebody
who bears the unbearable.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:10%
And until we can
bear the unbearable,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:10%
we are really frightened
of suffering, of death,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:10%
of all of it, this thing
that we repeat over and over

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:10%
and over again, hoping
to hear it sometime.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Do what you do
with another being,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
but never put them
out of your heart.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%
You can say no to somebody.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:90%
You can oppose them.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You can do what it is
within your role and dharma

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
you need to do.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But if it involves closing your
heart, you can't afford it.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And to keep your heart really
open with another being really

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
is soul business.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:10%
So every time I forget I'm
dealing with another soul,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:10%
and I got caught in
the dance of roles

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:10%
that we as egos
are in, my heart--

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:10%
I can feel it close,
and it hurts so bad.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like cutting you
off from the life force.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel I've deadened into
righteousness, for example.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
But I was right.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:90%
This person's bad.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:90%
But you're paying the price.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that bizarre?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Their badness is
their predicament.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Your reaction is yours.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got to close
your heart down to take action,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.471 align:middle line:84%
you're probably standing
in the wrong place.

00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you should be able to do
what you do with another human

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
being without forgetting that
you love the soul as a soul--

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
not their actions, but
their essence, their being.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
