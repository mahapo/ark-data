00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Meditation has shown you
how irascible your mind is,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
how much it floats all over
the place and grabs at this

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most profound
ways of working with service

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is to bring your
awareness right down

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to the act you're
doing to get so

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that when you're moving a brick,
you're just moving a brick.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking
about moving bricks.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.993 align:middle line:84%
You're not mythologising
moving the brick.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
moving of the brick.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
When you're washing the dishes,
you're just washing the dishes.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you can understand
that just in the breath

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
is the mystery, well, in
the washing of the dish

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
is the mystery.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
In the moving of the
brick is the mystery.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
In the handing of the glass
of water is a mystery.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The mystery of the universe
is in the precise action

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
of the moment.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It's in the joining of
the mind with the object.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the nama, the rupa
when they grab together.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what burns you out
is your thinking about what

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:90%
you're doing, not doing it.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
That's really what catches you.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
What wipes you out
is the thinking

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:84%
you do about your actions,
not the actions themselves.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:84%
People will go in, and
they'll sit all day long,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be exhausted
at the end of the day

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
not from physical
action, but from what

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:90%
their mind did during it.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The mind is going to
am I doing enough,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:90%
is it successful, et cetera.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And the secret of
action is always

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
if it is your dharma
to do the action,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you do it as
impeccably as you can,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and you offer the fruits
of the guru to God.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And what happens happens
not because you're

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to be good or
anxiety or anything,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.957 align:middle line:84%
just because you feel most
in harmony with everything

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing it that.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Why you serve people--

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about is
volunteering better

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:90%
than money, doing it for money?

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
All the motives for
why you're doing it,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're identifying
yourself with your motives,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.025 align:middle line:90%
you're short of the mark.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing it
for money, if you're

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
doing it to be good, if you're
doing it even to help somebody,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:90%
that's what's so weird.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're even serving to help,
you're already reducing it.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
You're serving because
you're serving,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:90%
because that's what you are.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there's suffering,
and there you are.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And you just start to enter
into the universe in such a way

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
that this is what happens
out of your being.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of that,
you may earn money from it,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and you may not.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.078 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it
doesn't really matter.

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a little
harder for you when

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
you got the money
thing to deal with,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
but it's a good work for you.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Know your limits,
because sometimes you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
can stay conscious in service
four and a half hours a day.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the four
and 3/4 hours, you go under.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
You can stay conscious
through helping so much,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
bit takes you under.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly--
it's too much.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is the
amount of suffering

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.333 align:middle line:84%
in the universe is so great,
you feel like you've never

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
given enough because you feel
like you're unworthy anyway,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:84%
so you figure, well,
I'll give more.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You keep giving more and
more and more and more.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And that art of learning
what your limits are

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can stay a little
conscious in learning how

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to say no and hold back,
you've got to trust and respect

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:90%
that place.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.295 align:middle line:84%
Because, otherwise, you go
under deeper and deeper,

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's harder and
harder to come up.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
In reading, some of you may
want to read about Hanuman

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason we read
Hanuman so much

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
is because Hanuman lived to
do service, but service to God

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
in whatever form it took.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And hanging out with Hanuman
and thinking about him

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and seeing yourself as
one of the band of monkeys

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:90%
is a way to do that process.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we're
all experimenting

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
with this process.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
aren't experiencing

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
from the way in which you
do service, whether it's

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
professional or personal
to another human being

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
or volunteer or paid or family
or to yourself, if you are not

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.045 align:middle line:84%
doing service in such a way
that at the end of the service

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
you feel freer, higher, clearer,
lighter, and more energized,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
you got work to do.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
