>> It's as if you and I
are learning how to swim.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And we keep coming back
to land, to touch down,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to be with the familiar
limits of our earth

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
on which we're
familiar with walking.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're still developing
our dolphinesque qualities,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
our ability to be at home in the
water of the great perfection,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:90%
pure awareness.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that when you have

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
built such a habitual
structure of self definition

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
on this plane of
reality, on Earth,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
to awaken to the realization
that it's beautiful

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
being just what it is,
and that there are places

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
you can see it from
that turn it from being

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a burdensome weight
to being a delightful play.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That at first the journey starts
where you are, on the normal

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
waking consciousness
plane, and you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
come into a kind of
spacious awareness

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
that's quiet and clear,
and you see it all.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no doing.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:90%
There's no coming.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:90%
There's no going.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:90%
There's just ah.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And then something causes
you to grab or fixate,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're suddenly
in familiar territory,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
back in the model of
your separateness.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I got
high, and I came down.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's a model
you imposed from

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
your habitual self-definition
of separateness.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So what does it take to bring
about the full transformation

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't
come back to that.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't reject it.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:84%
You dance in your separateness
without being entrapped by it.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
How can you transform
where you stand

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
or don't stand so that
there is no home to come to.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all just to play a form.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
All of the spiritual
practices move you

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
becoming familiar

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and at home in what
is often called

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:90%
the domain of the spirit.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You can feel that you have,
because of where you're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
starting from, your karmic
predicament, a proclivity,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
an attraction towards one
form more than another.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
For some of you, the kind
of metaphysical reflection,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
thinking about the nature
of self or things like that,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
right on, just
excites you immensely.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It keeps taking you to the edge.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else singing
om namah shivaya

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
brings you in through
the softness of the heart

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
into a quality of
spacious moment presence.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
For another person, the
grieving and acknowledging

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and being with stuff
of life has allowed

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:90%
you to relax, release, open.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Or still others,
just the meditative

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
opening into spacious
awareness simply

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
given through the
relaxed state of being

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:90%
is what touched you most deeply.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:10%
What we come away from is
hearing our own unique journey,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:10%
respecting the uniqueness of
others and their journeys,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:10%
and being careful not to get
too enamored of even your path,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:10%
but rather become free.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
How many moments in the journey
between what you think is here

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and what you think
is there, a moment

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
of appreciating a tree,
a moment, a predicament,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
a poignancy, the humor,
the flow, the emptiness,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the sweetness, the fullness.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
How many moments?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
How much will one get identified
with thought of planning?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
How will my life change?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The best practice to
be free is to be free.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the practice.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
If, for some strange chance,
you should happen to get lost

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
into your drama sometime
in the future again, don't.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
That image is that
forgetting is great

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's such
fun to remember.
