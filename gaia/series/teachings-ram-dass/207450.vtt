00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.364 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing is you begin to
see your personality needs

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:90%
as insatiable.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:84%
That one need just gets
substituted with another

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
sooner or later.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Somebody says, you're
very special to me.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
The next question
is, but really?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.831 align:middle line:90%
Or are you special enough to?

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's back with this
question about feelings

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:90%
of lack of self-love.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
may say, you know,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:90%
you're not special for me.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And if I really am
spacious in my awareness,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I see your mouth open
and these words come out

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're telling me
about you, not about me.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm a beautiful human being.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like me, that's
your problem, not mine.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Unless I buy it.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You don't like me, whew.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe next life.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you sort
of play with it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.115 align:middle line:84%
You just play with
it because you

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
see the intensity of the
drama and how the world turns

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and how on and on it goes, the
whole stuff of personality.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:90%
You become mindful of it.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You begin to be aware
of how it all works.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.360 align:middle line:84%
You keep seeing yourselves
doing repetitive patterns.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can spend the
rest of your life trying

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to work them out and
interpret, and understand,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and analyze, and work on them.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Or you can treat them as
thoughts or phenomena.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
They are phenomena
and they're going

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to go on because you
do have a personality

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and you do have a body.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are nesting
feelings and there's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
connectedness feelings.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Many of my friends if they
don't have a home and a family,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
they are feeling extremely
unable to do inner work.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And for others, their
home and their family

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:90%
seems a tremendous obstacle.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Like for me, it seems to
be a wonderful sadhana.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I find great peace in just
being this kind of liquidity.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Others are wandering
and they're miserable.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's less
interesting what

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
form your life is in than
the state of your being.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And as your state of
your being gets deeper,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
you can take the forms,
whichever ones arise,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and kind of work with them.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And that includes sickness,
and dying, and opportunities,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and lack of opportunities, and
being around miserable people,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
or being around beautiful
people, or being frustrated,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:90%
great sadnesses.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Personality is
like the sandpaper.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the stuff of
the incarnation.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking
at these trees.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Each of them has its own
unique characteristic

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:90%
but they're beautiful.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate them.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate the trees.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to judge them.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate them.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I find I don't have
to judge people either.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:90%
I can just appreciate.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And even when they say, I
don't think you're special,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I really see that as
their mind speaking.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has these mind nets
of reality that they put out

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying,
this is who I am.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:90%
This is what reality is.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're really strong.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you have two parents
that have a strong one of those,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:90%
you buy in.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like a tuna being netted.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:90%
You got caught in a mind net.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is
I meet each person

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's like projective
systems coming towards you.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Each person is looking
at you and telling you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:90%
who they think you are.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they're seeing
is the projections

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of their own relation to their
father or whatever it is.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.173 align:middle line:90%
They don't know who I am.

00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who I am.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:90%
How could they know?

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But when you find the place in
yourself where you just are,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
you are, and you are unique, and
you are part of the universe,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and you're one with God.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's all empty, and it's all
dream stuff, and it's all true.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:90%
And here we are, all of it.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
