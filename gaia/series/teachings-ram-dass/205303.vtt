>> The stance of listening,
of listening ever more deeply

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to hear how this moment
in life can awaken.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Because every situation
is so multiply

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
determined that your rational,
analytic mind can't really

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
know what the hell is
going on, even though we

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.075 align:middle line:90%
would love to think we could.

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We have gotten so
enamored of the siddhi

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
of our prefrontal
lobes that we have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:90%
forgotten how finite they are.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just another power.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It's just another power.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that we
have lacked our trust in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is the wisdom, the
inherent wisdom in us,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the sense in the
heart-mind wisdom,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive wisdom that
exists as you extricate yourself

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
from identifying with any
specific thought form.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So that people say to me, why,
when we ask you a question,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:90%
are you silent first?

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Because what I do is empty to
experience the gestalt of you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
asking the question,
the tone of your voice

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
as you're asking the
question, what history

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
must have led to
asking the question.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:10%
What is my whole history
that has brought me

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:10%
to an understanding of
what your question is.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
What is everybody else's need
in this room about the question.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I've just got to empty
and empty and empty

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
until all of these forces
are like awash in me,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're all just part of
the ocean of my awareness.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that will
come some response that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is in some way relevant
to what you said,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:90%
or irrelevant, depending.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's none
of my business.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I just trusted the universe
to come forth with a response.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's fun to
start to practice

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
trusting the universe in
the way you live your life.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get more
calls or more things

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:90%
than I can deal with.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
sometimes which one.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And I trust.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.155 align:middle line:84%
I say, I'll do this one,
I won't do that one.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And somebody says, well,
why did you do that?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I say, I don't know.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.662 align:middle line:90%
And it infuriates people.

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you can
use it as a copout,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
but you certainly can develop
a deeper and deeper trust

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in your intuitive wisdom,
in the wisdom fount that is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
pouring forth from inside you.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that intuitive
wisdom tells you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
which fires will burn you
up, because you're still

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
too attached to somebody-ness,
and which fires will purify.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
fires that liberate,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
certain fires that burn.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing what
fires you can transmute

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and which ones you can't leads
you to define the boundaries.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Not boundaries to push
away God, but boundaries

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the stage and
the level of your development.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
things that I haven't

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
dealt with in my
life, and maybe I'm

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:90%
not going to in this lifetime.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And maybe as my love of God and
presence and spaciousness gets

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
deeper, they will all fall
away and be irrelevant,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and maybe they won't.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But I have to trust what I can
transmute and what I can't.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I can feel that certain
things I get into are so thick,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and I get so stuck, that I'm
not yet ready to work with that.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And I really allow the timing.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying, oh my
God, I'm stuck in this.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll never-- and I used
to do that all the time.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I used to see all of my neuroses
and all my clingings and stuff

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
like that as standing
between me and God.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that now.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I see them as something that may
remain, but the meaning of them

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
may change, and
they may just turn

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:84%
into my style being manifest,
rather than my obstacles.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And that'll happen
very gracefully.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.447 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
happening gracefully.

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to feel that life
is this kind of a process,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
so that when you feel
you fell off the path,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
you just say, ah,
falling off the path.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:90%
More process.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Because where could you go?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Maharaji said, I am always
in communion with you.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
God's always there.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:10%
You may forget, and it
may be a hell for you,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:10%
but the power of
that forgetting will

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:10%
affect the richness of
the remembering whenever

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:10%
it happens.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And it will also affect
every subsequent forgetting.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So don't think you
fall off the path.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
fraudulent concept.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I just can't buy it.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear it.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.623 align:middle line:84%
I meet people who tell me they
fell off the path 20 years ago,

00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and I look into their
hearts, and their hearts

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:90%
are so beautiful.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realize the pain
they've been through

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
of falling off the
path and how that

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
has burned into them
a compassion that

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:90%
is such a payoff.
