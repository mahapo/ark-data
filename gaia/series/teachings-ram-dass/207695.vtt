00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I judge myself less
harshly and appreciate myself

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%
more?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the heart
of it is observing

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:90%
oneself more impersonally.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I often use this image which
I've used already, I think,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.093 align:middle line:84%
that when you go out into the
woods and you look at trees,

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
you see all these
different trees.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.885 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are bent,
and some of them are straight,

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:90%
and some of them are evergreens.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the tree,
and you just allow it.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:90%
You appreciate it.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:90%
You see why it is the way it is.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
You sort of understand that
it didn't get enough light,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:90%
and so it turned that way.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get all
emotional about it.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:90%
You just allow it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:90%
You appreciate the tree.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
The minute you get near
humans, you lose all that.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're constantly
saying, you're too this,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
or I'm too this, or that
judging mind comes in.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I practice turning
people into trees,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
which means appreciating
them just the way they are.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
period of time where

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a picture
of myself on my puja table.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And people would
come and say, my god,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
what an ego this guy's got.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
He's got his own picture
on his puja table.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But really, what it
was was a chance for me

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to practice opening
my heart to myself

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.008 align:middle line:84%
and to appreciate the
predicament I'm in.

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.478 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:52.478 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
whole incarnation.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
If I'm quiet enough, I can see
his storyline, the storyline

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of our predicament.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's finding a
place in yourself

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
from which you see
the unfolding of law.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Dad did this.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Mother did this.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Economics did this.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Education did this.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Opportunity did this.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
All of this course and effect
previous incarnations, all

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of it is just an unfolding
of a storyline, a drama.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're just sort of
watching this story unfold.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
me because I'm not that.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
That's just a set of
phenomena happening.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at yourself as a set

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
of phenomena, what is to judge?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to appreciate
your uniqueness without it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
being better or worse.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:90%
It's just different.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.957 align:middle line:84%
It's just when you get
inside identification

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
with your personality that
you get into the judging mode

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because then you are part
of that lawful unfolding.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You're not stepping
outside of it at all.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The witness or the spacious
awareness is outside of it.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's another
contextual framework.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
As you're more quiet inside
so that you notice and you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
can see your own thoughts
a little more clearly,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
you will see your father's
voice and your mother's voice

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and all your
education, principles,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
voices inside your head,
constantly saying things

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
You will see that
that judge is inside.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And you keep giving it power
by identifying with it.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And you feel yourself
at war with yourself,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that there's a part of
you that's doing it,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
part of you that's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:90%
judging what you're doing.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And as you're quieter,
you see the dynamics

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
between the superego,
the id, the ego,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and you see it all
as just phenomena.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
A psychologist-- I can
study those phenomena

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:90%
in another person.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Why not study it myself?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Part of what drugs did
for me and then meditation

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
did for me, and all
the spiritual things,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is it helps me stand back
and get outside of it,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:90%
to see it for what it is.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just stuff, stuff,
phenomena, phenomena.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:90%
