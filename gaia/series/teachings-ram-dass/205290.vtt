00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And just one more thing that
we begin to appreciate as we

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:90%
start to awaken.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we ask ourselves,
if all this is true,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:90%
what are we doing here?

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
How did we get caught
in this absurdity?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing in this
illusion of separateness?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
What is the meaning
of incarnation?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Why did it all start?

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
In the minute you start to
ask those questions, that's

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
part of this process.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:10%
And what seems to be
required since that which

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:10%
asks that question, which is
the analytic rational mind

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
can't know the answer
because like it's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:10%
a subsystem that
can't know the meta

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:10%
system that lies behind it.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
There's an extraordinary
appreciation

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that even though you
can't know the answer,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you can devote your life
to approaching the answer,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
appreciation that incarnation

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
or what would be called
karma is a blueprint

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:90%
for your own awakening.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
You can call my life my karma,
my incarnation my curriculum.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a set of life experiences
which you're creating.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It's how you see reality
and how I see reality,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
our different realities.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that yours
is different from mine

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
isn't by chance, it's
by karma, and that karma

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:90%
turns into your Dharma.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
That means the stuff that's
given to you becomes your path,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and you use your
unique entrapment

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
as the vehicle for getting
free of entrapment.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
So as the Gita says, to do
someone else's Dharma is,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
gunner, not going to work.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:90%
You have to do your own.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
See, the real appreciation
and the fun of it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that
just where you are

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
you are in exactly
the right place

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
at this moment from your
evolutionary point of view.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:90%
There are no errors in the game.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
There's not even a
possibility of one.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Because most everybody hides
and if it only weren't for this,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and even hiding in
that is perfect.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:90%
It's too beautiful.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
It's too beautiful that
your incarnation turns out

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to be the blueprint
for your liberation.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Who would have expected that?

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Judeo-Christian
[? teachings ?]

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:90%
all teach that it's an error.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's some falling
from grace, it's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:90%
some really some abysmal thing.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Full of lust, and greed,
and fear, and hatred.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Those are the stepping stones
of the path to enlightenment.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Greed, you go through
greed into trance greed.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I want it, I want it, I want
it, I want it until, right,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and this is it.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But then the recognition that
all the desires and motives

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
there in your unique game that
are bringing you to something,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:90%
it's always the same something.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain
feeling of well-being,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
a certain feeling
of, yeah, I'm home.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, phew.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
A new car, the good
diagnosis, the whatever

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:90%
it is, it's oh, yes, smooth.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.865 align:middle line:90%
And for a moment, you feel hmm.

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:38.665 align:middle line:90%
But it changes.

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
king that was going

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to kill the tribe of people, and
the tribe came and they said,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
is there anything we
can do to prevent you

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
from killing all of us?

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.427 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you can
come up with something

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that when I'm sad
will make me happy,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
you've got overnight to do it.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And the wise men all gathered
and then they formed a ring

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and they gave him a ring, and
the rings had inscribed in it,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and this too shall pass.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.025 align:middle line:84%
Now he said, oh,
that's very wise.

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Because what he
didn't recognize,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:90%
it works the other way, too.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
God, this is
wonderful, it'll pass.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just another polarity.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If you try to milk
the game for pleasure,

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
you're investing in
displeasure or pain.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Beyond pleasure and
pain, what is there?

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a quality
of happiness that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
embraces pleasure and pain,
all of it, all at once.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, it's the moment.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the present moment.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
It's dying in the
moment of fullness.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what our game is about.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the metaphysical
underpinnings

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of what it is
we're playing with.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
