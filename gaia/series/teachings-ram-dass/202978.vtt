00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened to me, in brief
from inside myself, was that,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
after I took the psilocybin
mushrooms in 1961,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:84%
my entire understanding
of reality changed.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And it changed my entire life.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what
happened was that I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
went from seeing a reality that
I had been trained to interpret

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:90%
as reality as absolutely real.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I went from that to, in a
moment, moving through planes

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to understand
that the reality that I thought

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
was real--

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
like, Richard, come
down to reality,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
as my father would say--

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:90%
was indeed just one reality.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It was relatively real
instead of absolutely real.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
What happened to me was
exactly what Einstein

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:84%
did to Newton,
because Newton said,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
these laws are absolutely
real-- mechanistic theory.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember learning
it in high school

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
as, absolutely, that's
the way the world is.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, basically,
Einstein said,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
it depends on where you're
standing in time and space

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't overestimate
the significance

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
of the shift of
consciousness that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
goes from seeing
reality as absolute

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:90%
to seeing it as relative.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It opens up a vast
terrain of possibilities.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It's what William James
said when he said,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
our normal waking
consciousness is but one type

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, while
all about it, parted

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
from it by the
filmiest of screens,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
there lie other types
of consciousness.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We may spend our entire
lives without knowing

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
of their existence, but
apply the requisite stimulus

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and there they are in
their completeness.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Whatever their meaning, they
prohibit our premature closing

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:90%
of our accounts with reality."

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and I was basically thrown
out of William James Hall

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard for arguing that the
intellectual analytic mind was

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
only one plane of reality,
because that was heresy

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:90%
within that temple.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So opening the doors of
that, do you see what it did?

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It cast me out from
the dominant theme

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of our culture,
which is basically

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
a form of scientific
materialism.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It's rooted in the feeling
that technology and science

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
have paid off so
much in changing

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:90%
the quality of our lives.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And those models, a
way of defining reality

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and how to interpret what's
real, have worked so well.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
We can't really question them.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The predicament is they
are relatively real,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are other realities
they have nothing to say about.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But science really
has a hard time

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
accepting there are
other realities it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:90%
can't say anything about.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like the issue of
consciousness versus the brain.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Science really has very little
to say about consciousness.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It's got a lot to
say about the brain.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So, since it's got a lot to say
about the brain, what it says,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
then, is the brain
and consciousness

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
are really one
thing-- isomorphic.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But our technology doesn't
allow us to measure it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
from the point of
view of consciousness,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.415 align:middle line:90%
so we'll work on the brain.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But we know, when your
brain is dead, you aren't.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that has seen
relative reality says--

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:90%
like they do in India.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
When you die in India, they
called it dropping the body.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
What an interesting image.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
drop my body today.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Who's the I that's
going to drop what?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
In the West, that's a
very peculiar expression,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because when your body
isn't, you aren't.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me that
what happened to me in 1961

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and that certainly
got reconfirmed

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
1,000 times over when I met
Neem Karoli Baba in 1967

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
was that there was a larger
context in which I existed

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
than the one that
I thought I did

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and that everybody around
me was telling me I did.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:90%
