00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We used to think that what
we thought was the best way

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:90%
to play the game.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The thinking mind,
and then science,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
which is its child, and then
technology, which is its child,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
would take and reorganize
everything in such a way

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we would be happy, free
of suffering, joyful, peaceful.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Did it work?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
world at this moment,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard not to see a
fear-driven social structure.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And yet what we
touched certainly

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s was a sense of
a love-driven, if you will,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
social structure.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
But what happened in the '60s?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were very
naive, and we assumed

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that once we saw this
incredible power of love, which

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
had to do with egalitarian
and compassionate

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
human relationships,
we tasted that,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and we felt its inherent
power so strongly.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We just assumed everything
would fall before it.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And the minstrels that
Bob Dylan and the Grateful

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Dead and the Rolling
Stones and, on and on,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
they carried the message.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, 10 and
12 and 14-year-olds

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
were sitting with
their earphones

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
on, listening to
the words coming out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
of people who were playing
with planes of consciousness.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And the minute you start to
have the perspective of playing

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously with more than
one plane of consciousness,

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
you are free of the oppressive
power of any institution

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:90%
on any one plane.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the Pentagon
is relatively real rather

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
than absolutely real.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But what, in fact, happened in
the '60s was that the people

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
that hadn't been touched by
that direct experience of unity,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of interdependency, and who
were stuck in their separateness

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and, thus, frightened
and, therefore,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
were collecting power and
material power and worldly

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
power in order to fend
off the anxiety generated

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%
by their fear--

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately,
to fend off death--

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and those people
looked around, and they

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
saw an emerging
consciousness that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
undercut the social institutions
that empowered them.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And they got frightened.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And what fear leads
to is fanaticism.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:90%
We can't hear anybody else.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You get caught in
a belief system.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And the human
psyche, unless it has

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
evolved to be resting
simultaneously

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.108 align:middle line:84%
in the plane of emptiness
where there is no time

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and there's no space and
nothing's coming and nothing's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
going, chaos and
anarchy are very scary.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Because in chaos and anarchy,
the worst that can happen

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:90%
is you could die.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a philosophical
materialist, that's a drag.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're a mystic, it's
just very interesting.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're a high enough mystic,
it's just another moment.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.287 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, that's
why I, too, had

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
a difficult time with the
word "revolution" because I've

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
always pitted revolution, which
is something against something,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
to evolution, which is something
which evolves into something,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it embraces everything
into itself as it evolves.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But I could see it as
revolution from the unconscious

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:90%
into the conscious.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the word
"hope," I have really

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
lived for a number of years
now with Trungpa Rinpoche's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
teaching, which he said,
"You have to stand halfway

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
between hope and hopelessness."

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
See, I'm talking now to you
about what myths you and I

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
have to live with in order to be
effective players in the game.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
What can we get from our
spiritual work all these years?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Our inner work, our development
work, our personality work.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
What can we get now that
as we hear-- once again,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:90%
as we heard in the '60s--

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
a kind of liquid possibility
that the kind of dream

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
or vision we have
deep in our being

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that there can be
social structures that

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:90%
are compassionate?

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
They can be social
structures which are just,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:90%
where there is real equity.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Dreams that we can
hear each other

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate ethnic diversity
instead of being threatened

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
by it; dreams that we can
walk lightly on the earth;

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
dreams that we can
just hear each other--

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
the dream that the participant
in the social structure

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
can have a balance
within their being,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
between their preoccupation
with their own individuality

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and their membership in the
community that is concerned

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:90%
with the common good--

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
common good of the earth
and species, common good

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of species with each
other and with themselves.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:90%
