00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:12.325 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, we have to
understand that as humans,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
we are awakening out of the
illusion of our separateness

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and our identification with our
bodies and our personalities.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we awaken,
as we pull back,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
we listen clearly to hear
how we are to be on Earth.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
What is our route,
what is our work

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that allows
us to awaken fully?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken fully
through what we do on Earth?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, at first, you are drawn
to one spiritual practice

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:90%
or another.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Say you are drawn to devotion
because your heart's very open.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy for you.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So you would do
devotional practices

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
because they're very
natural for you.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And the philosophical
stuff or the zen stuff

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be attractive.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't appeal
to you at all.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Later in your evolution,
you get to the point

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
where you want to be
free so badly that you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
are drawn to the things that
are difficult because those are

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
the things that are
catchy, your places

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
where you're out of balance.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Like if your body energies
aren't working well

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
but your heart's
wonderful, you'll

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
find yourself wanting to
get your energies moving

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
you're being blocked,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
or you'll find yourself
wanting to develop

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:90%
more discipline of mind.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.655 align:middle line:84%
Some people meditate
because it's natural to them

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to meditate, and
other times they

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:90%
meditate because they hate it.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine, too.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're guided by your
intuitive wisdom about that.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
You see, at first,
that's the difference

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:90%
between high and free.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
In terms of listening
for unique manifestation,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you've got to understand
that the form is

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in a world of anicca, or a
world of changing phenomena.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That everything's
changing all the time.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very
critical because when

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.743 align:middle line:84%
you're listening for your
unique manifestation,

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
you've got to
understand that what

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
you hear this moment may
be different than what

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:90%
you hear a moment later.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have to deal with the
inconsistency and everybody's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
expectations that you
will be consistent.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
"What do you want to
be when you grow up?"

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:84%
"Well, I think
I'll be a doctor."

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And then you're trapped.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.022 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
I said I wanted

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to be a doctor when
I was nine years old,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.067 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I had a microscope
and books on medicine,

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and everybody said, he
wants to be a doctor.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.108 align:middle line:84%
And then it was really hard
to get out from under it.

00:02:58.108 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to keep failing my
exams to get out of it.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to be ready
to know that what

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
you hear at one moment
about unique manifestation

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is going to
constantly be changing

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:90%
and changing and changing.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to be
listening afresh all the time.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You're listening for a
unique manifestation,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:90%
meaning that form of expression.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the confluence between
your karma and your dharma.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Karma meaning the unfolding of
the laws of cause and effect

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that have created you
to be what you are,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and that are still
affecting you lawfully.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:84%
There's an unfolding law, like
a river, of you manifesting.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
think something,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking
it out of a vacuum.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking it as a
result of how you've learned

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to think things in the past.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Then how your parents
thought, and what

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
your chemistry is of your
brain, and all sorts of things

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
are affecting what you
think at this moment.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
That's your karma.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Your dharma is that
which brings you home.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It brings you to truth.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.572 align:middle line:90%
It brings you to God.

00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It brings you to the oneness.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It brings you back
into the unity.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It brings you out of the
illusion of separateness.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The dharma is the
way or the path.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the root.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
It's the appropriate action.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're doing as you
listen more quietly, you hear--

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
as you pull back more inside,
in a meditative space,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and hear more clearly--

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
you hear the way your
karma is unfolding.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And you hear, you intuitively
feel your root home.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And you keep feeling
these things together.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
At one point, my guru--

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, how do I know God?

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:90%
He said, feed people.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And he said, serve people.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's in me somewhere.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
That is my karma.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It's also my dharma.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to resist
it all the way along,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
but every time I meditate,
and the quieter I get,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
the more I feel I should
be out serving people.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:07.158 align:middle line:90%
