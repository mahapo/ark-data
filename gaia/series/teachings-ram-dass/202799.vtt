00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two issues
that come within the realm

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:90%
of what's called the mystery.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:90%
One is suffering.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:90%
And one is death.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because people say, if
all this is so benevolent,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:90%
why is there suffering?

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So I listen to the
Buddha's Noble Truths.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
there is suffering.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The second one is the cause
of it is the clinging.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The third is let go of
the clinging of mind,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:90%
you let go of suffering.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Fourth is the eightfold
path, how to do that.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I realize, that has
to do with my suffering,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that I can get to
the point where I

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
can work with my own suffering.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't ask for suffering.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
along, I see it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:84%
as a clue to me of where
the clinging of my mind is.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And since I want to get free,
that suffering at that point

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
literally becomes grace,
because it is something

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:90%
that will help me get free.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.397 align:middle line:84%
But as you and I both in
our human hearts know,

00:01:08.397 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
when somebody comes up to you
and says they're starving,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
it's a pretty empty thing
to say, that's grace, baby.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can know something

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
about how you work
with suffering,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and at the same
moment their suffering

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:90%
is breaking your heart.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're left with the
mystery, is suffering grace

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:90%
or is it an error?

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Or is it wrong or is it right?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Do people use it or don't they?

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, my guru said to me,
God comes to the hungry

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in the form of food.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was on benefits
at many peace rallies.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always amazed at
how angry everybody is.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
busy being peaceful,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
but what they're conveying
is something that isn't

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:90%
creating peace in the universe.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, can they
protest against injustice,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and in war, and
nuclear proliferation,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and all that
without being angry?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And can they do it and be
peaceful at the same moment?

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do, it seems
to me, with whether or not

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
you can live on more than
one plane of consciousness

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I was upset about
Bangladesh at one point.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to take my
Volkswagen over there.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
My guru didn't tell me whether
to do it or not to do it.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, Ram Dass, don't
you see it's all perfect?

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.283 align:middle line:84%
And that was like a red
flag in front of a bull.

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
it's all perfect?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:90%
It stinks.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting worse.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And he'd go, don't you
see it's all perfect?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, he didn't mean it's
all perfect, so do nothing.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Human can you simultaneously
not judge God and still

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:90%
deal with suffering?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Because in the judging, you
say, there is an error here.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even know
whether there is or not.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
My rational mind cannot
understand the meta system

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
in which good, evil, and
death, and all that stuff are.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
It is at the realm of mystery.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how you
respond to the mystery?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Do you assume mystery is dark?

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Or do you assume it's not?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I experience is
that, as I go to Guatemala

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and look at a Mayan
woman who has lost

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
her children in violence, and
she's standing right here,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and we look into
one another's eyes,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and I see such beauty
and such suffering,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
at the level that I'm part
of the Seva Foundation,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I will do what I can to
relieve her physical suffering.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
But if I am just part of the
Seva Foundation giving food

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
to her because she is hungry or
to her child, that's wonderful.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But what I am also doing
at that same moment

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
is I am reinforcing the whole
world in which suffering

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's those two
planes that allow

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
me to look at
suffering with wonder

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and then allow my human heart
to keep breaking and do what

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I can to end it,
because there are

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:90%
different levels of the heart.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
There is the emotional,
psychological, personal,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you as a separate
entity that says,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:84%
if I was starving on the streets
of Calcutta, or in Somalia,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
or wherever I am, it
would hurt like hell.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
rid of it, that pain.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to get rid of pain.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you're overwhelmed,
because there is so much of it,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:90%
you can't get rid of it.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And so you go into a depression.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
And does that help the pain?

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that help anybody's pain?

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting question.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're really
compassionate and you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
want to relieve
suffering, you've

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
got to do what Gandhi
said, which he said,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
my life is my message.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And your message has
to be one of the hand

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to
relieve the suffering,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and at the same moment, the
faith, and the equanimity,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and the joy of the universe.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
balancing act that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
allows you to look at
suffering and then hear out

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
of the gestalt of all
the suffering, and you,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and your skills, and your
opportunities, and all of it,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
what is going to
be your next act?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And trust the intuitive
heart to define the next act.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And the next act
might be sitting here.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be getting up and
walking out and finding food

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to feed to somebody homeless.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's no better or worse.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.855 align:middle line:84%
And you've just got
to hear what you've

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
got to do with this moment
to get that balance together.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And finally, your
compassion to other people

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
forces you to work on yourself,
is what it boils down to.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have this relationship
where you work on yourself

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:90%
as an offering to others.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the way I do it now is
I work with others as a way

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
to work on myself.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:90%
