[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The Third Noble
Truth of the Buddha.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Within what is called
devotional tantra,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the
forms, the experiences,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.605 align:middle line:84%
are all appreciated and
related to as the Mother.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.885 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are familiar
with the terms "Maya"

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
or the "Holy Spirit."

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
There is an expression in
this form of devotional tantra

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that says either you cover
the Mother with the world

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
or you cover the
world with the Mother.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
If you cover the
Mother with the world,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
you are lost in the world.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And a car is a car,
and a television set

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is a television set, and anger
is anger, and doubt is doubt,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and a mother and a father
are a mother and a father.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If you cover the world with
the Mother every experience

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that you have in
this lifetime is but

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
another aspect of the Mother.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And in this reality,
you as a seeker

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
are relating to the
universe as the Mother.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And your relation
is one of learning

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to love, feed from,
interact with, consume,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and finally devour the Mother.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The Mother has many faces, the
Virgin Mary, Durga, Lakshmi,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.255 align:middle line:84%
Kali, face after
face of the Mother.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Some are wrathful.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Some are tender.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Some are giving.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe into your
soul, with each in breath,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
you begin to feed
upon the Mother.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
All of the sounds you hear
are the Mother, feelings

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:90%
in your body, the Mother.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
All of it has become the
same thing, the Mother.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:90%
You drink into your chest.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
What comes in is as if it were
a golden mist, a substance.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But the process of incorporating
the universe into yourself

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is the process of making
love to, and flowing with,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.205 align:middle line:90%
and drinking from the Mother.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
For as you take each
experience in your life

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and redefine it as a
form of the Mother,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and then acknowledge, and
honor, and allow its space,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
you are slowly consuming
your own attachments

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:90%
to individual differences.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
As it is said, you
are like a candle

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in the niche, where the flame
never flickers no matter

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.885 align:middle line:90%
how wild the winds blow.

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
For there is nothing that the
Mother can do that you cannot

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:90%
consume in love.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This is returning to the flow
with the forms of the universe.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.745 align:middle line:84%
We are now dealing
only with form.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in all of your thoughts.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Just draw them into your
being, fill with them

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
as if they all were turning into
a fluid you were filling with.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
For that is the
fuel you will use.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.925 align:middle line:84%
You will consume the
Mother to go to the Father.

00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.415 align:middle line:84%
You will consume the form
to enter into the formless.

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
You must consume the universe.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
For that plane of reality,
where there is only one of us,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:90%
you are the universe.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It is the Mother looking at
itself, acknowledge, honor,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
love, flow.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Let the breath flow in and out.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you take it in, fill with
the experiences of your life.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
