00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting that as
you extricate yourself from

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
your identification
with your separateness,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
your whole feeling
about death changes.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the part of you that
isn't separate isn't coming

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't going.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no birth and there's
no death, you just are.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But because that part of you
is not knowable by your mind,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
your mind keeps
denying its existence.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The part of you that is not
in form is only be-able,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
it's not knowable.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And the mind goes
up the wall trying

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
control that part of you.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And for us to stretch
to handle what

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
seems like a paradox to the
mind, that it's all perfect

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's horrible, that
there's nothing to do really,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
so get on with it, you start
to embrace the human condition

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:90%
into yourself.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Like if you live
fully in this moment,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
does this moment
include that baby

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that's taking its last
breath from starvation?

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:90%
So are you sad?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Does it include the baby
taking its first breath

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
as it comes out of
its mother's womb

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and the joy of the beginning?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
So you're happy.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
If you are the fullness
of the moment, all of it,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:90%
these are all your voices.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
If you and I are
to be free, there

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:90%
is nothing we can push away.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
When you have
extricated yourself

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
from your own
egocentric predicament

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and when you have tasted
the emptiness of all forms,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
then your action comes out
of the collective quality

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
of the situation, and the
suffering of another person

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is something you do not
because I'm helping you,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
but because it is
healing itself.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
collecting points for it.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You are merely tuning
yourself to being

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
part of the harmony of things.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're dying into
the perfection of it all,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
which includes the
beauty of your mind.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's the servant.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It's available, but you are no
longer trapped inside of it.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just the subtlest
flip in where you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:90%
are in relation to who you are.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Before, you identified
with the clouds.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you understand that you
are the sky and the clouds.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
As you extricate yourself
from your somebodyness,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
from your thoughts,
which are things,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
from your body, which is
things or stuff, who you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:90%
are has no time, has no space.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not here.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
With that quietness comes a
way of being in the universe.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are part,
you are one with it all.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:10%
So that the action that you
perform is a separate entity

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:10%
arises out of the collective
wisdom of the situation.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Rather than doing it in
an angular way cut off

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
from everything, you start to
trust your intuitive heart.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And under those
conditions, you start

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
to become responsive to
the world around you,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:90%
rather than reactive.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind is part of
law, it's all cause and effect

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:90%
and it's all reactive.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
The minute you're in
that awareness behind it,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:90%
you're free.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:90%
