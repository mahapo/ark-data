00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> As you extricate yourself
from these identities,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
from these roles, you learn
how to wear roles, to use them,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to function within them.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
You and I have to
meet through role.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The question is how you can
be in a role and not of it.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
How you can be in the role?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm lecturing,
and you're audience.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to be
busy being an audience.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not speaking.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.853 align:middle line:90%
You're not audience.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We're just beings
being together.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And it just happens the
vehicle for us being together

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
is this speaking
and this listening.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The minute you
become the listener,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:90%
you make me the speaker.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
The minute you identify
with your role,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:90%
you make me an object.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The minute you don't
identify with your role

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and I don't identify with
my role, how many of us

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:90%
are there anyway?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:90%
There's only one of it.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
There's one of it playing
with these different forms.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So that as you get into
meditative practice,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
you begin to examine
what roles you're really

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
caught in needing.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to feel where the
aversions and the attractions

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:90%
are in your own mind.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
process of meditation,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.200 align:middle line:84%
is to extricate yourself
from these clingy things that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
are models and habits of
thought and definitions.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Until they come
very, very lightly.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
If I'm representing
the Seva Foundaion,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I am a foundation
representative.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm lying
around in the hot tub,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a foundation
representative.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody lying
in the hot tub.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I move from moment
to moment to moment.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
And Gandhi gave
that little story

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
that I've told so many times.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's so powerful for
us in this culture.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.438 align:middle line:84%
When he was leading
a march, and he saw

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be
violence, and he said

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.522 align:middle line:90%
he was going to stop the march.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And the people, his
lieutenants said,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:90%
you can't do this, Gandhi.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
People left their
jobs to follow you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands
of people involved.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, God
is absolute truth.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I am a human.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I only know relative truth.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding of truth
changes from day to day.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And my commitment must be to
truth, not to consistency.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now you just look
at your life and ask

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
how much is your commitment
to consistency and not truth?

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
How much in order to
make it all run smooth

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are you just who everybody
expects you to be all the time?

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
How consistent are we?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
How afraid are we
of inconsistency?

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, to be truthful, does it
mean to appear inconsistent?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
know you're nobody,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
then you can be anybody.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.105 align:middle line:84%
Then you can be
consistent all the time

00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
matter to you.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But as long as you think you're
somebody and you're consistent,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:90%
you're trapped.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm experiencing is
the less I define myself,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
the more available I am
to other human beings.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
The less I am living within
the box of my self-definition

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that constantly
uses the universe

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to reassure me of who I am,
then the more flexible I am.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So that am I a student,
or am I a teacher?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So the spiritual
journey is really

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:90%
going into nobody training.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:90%
