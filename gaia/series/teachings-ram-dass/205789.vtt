00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:84%
RAM DASS: Each of us has a
unique karmic predicament.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
In order to hear that, you
have to shut up with your mind.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:10%
You have to quiet
down enough to tune

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:10%
to the gestalt of what
is, which includes

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:10%
your skills, your past, your
opportunities, and when you're

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:10%
empty enough, not by
your rational mind,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:10%
but by an intuitive sense of
for this moment, this is right.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I've started
tune my life not

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to these kind of temporal models
of career and plans and all,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:84%
but from moment to moment
is this in harmony?

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I had the most
ghastly experience.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I was doing the book,
"How Can I Help?"

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And I ran out of
typing paper and I

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
was in the middle of
an important section.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And I drove to town.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I passed a guy on
crutches that was thumbing.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't pick
him up, because he

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.302 align:middle line:84%
would have taken so
long to get into the car

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:90%
and get out of the car.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to get
the paper in order

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to get back to write the
book, "How Can I Help?"

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't spend the rest of my
life beating myself for that.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I did what I could
do with the time what

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought was an
appropriate action,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:90%
but I have to keep listening.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I fall on my
face, I get up and say,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.943 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm not fully
tuning just yet.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a little
deeper tuning I can do.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of my friends
are in business.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Ben Cohen, Ben and Jerry's
Ice Cream, Ben was telling me,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
first, he and Jerry
were ice cream guys.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
They just scooped ice
cream at a cornershop.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly they realized
they were business people.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
They had employees
and factories.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what
are we doing in this?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking to
an older man who was

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:90%
in business who was his friend.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The guy said to,
Ben, if you don't

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
like business,
instead of leaving it,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
why don't you just change it?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And so they did.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.890 align:middle line:84%
They started to have
a double bottom line

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
so that the success
of the company

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is also in terms of,
how much they help

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:84%
the environment and the
people, the community

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:90%
to be free of suffering.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
They started supporting
all employees

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to do volunteer work by giving
them times leaves to do that.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole way of making a
business a compassionate thing

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and still being
highly successful.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:90%
He did it through business.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else does that
through government.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else does it
through raising children.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else does
it through education.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else does it
through picking up cans.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else does it
by helping somebody

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:90%
that's fallen to get up.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say that when
you say, what can I do,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
it's not a thing.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of listening,
responding, tuning,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:90%
harmonizing, listening again.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
