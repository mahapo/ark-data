00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in the
course of the years,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:84%
I've developed a lot of
very strange friends,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is a
being named Emmanuel.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And Emmanuel is interesting,
because Emmanuel

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a body.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a being on another plane.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And Emmanuel had
a good teaching.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me read you one of
the things he said to me.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You are here
because you chose to be here,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a learning place.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Each lifetime is a
wonderful opportunity

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to expand your consciousness
and to move closer, ever closer

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
to your oneness with God.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
This happens in
very small stages.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
First, oneness
with self, oneness

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
with your human community,
then oneness with God.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be done in
one blinding flash.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It would be too
incomprehensible,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:90%
too confusing.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%
So be patient.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
When we choose to come
back, we construct an embryo

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
to hold within us the
areas of distortion

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:90%
that we need to work on.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we choose our
infinite environment

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to act as a catalyst to
bring out these areas.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So you were where you
needed to be as a child.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So accept the
distortions in you,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
because when you accept
them, you can transform them.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what life is about.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
You are here to find these
areas of imperfection,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand
them, to love them,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and to educate them
into a reality, which

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:90%
is truth, light, love.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
If in the transitional
period you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
find things in yourself
that are not perfect,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
don't blame yourself.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Celebrate."

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So in effect, what Emmanuel
said to me when I said to him,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
"Emmanuel, what work
do I have to do now?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, Ram Dass,
you're in a school.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.686 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you try
taking the curriculum?

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:90%
He said, you took a human birth.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.595 align:middle line:84%
You're so busy being holy,
why don't you try being human?

00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow, being
human was less than perfect.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Even though I
intellectually knew

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that form is no other than
formless and formless is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
no other than form and I knew
that the manifestation was

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
God made manifest, everything
was perfect out there

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:90%
except me.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "OK,
Emmanuel, here I go."

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I decided I'd just
to go and be human.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd already figured
this out, really.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I had already figured
out that as long

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
as I pushed anything
in the universe away,

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to be free.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that the game
wasn't getting high.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The game was being
free and that free

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:90%
included the highs and the lows.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Free included it all.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
All and everything,
as Gurdjieff said.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Not, this is all
god except that.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
You just can't get
stuck in those places.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.157 align:middle line:90%
It's not good enough.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do that up
to a certain point,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
but then the witness is just
another part of your ego,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.582 align:middle line:84%
It's just a part looking
at the other part.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you
witness the witness,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's the kind of
meditative technique

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:90%
you turn in on yourself.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And you-- but behind
all that, there's

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
just a context of frame
of reference of is-ness.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
any quality to it.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't say it's happy,
or sad, or watchful,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.435 align:middle line:84%
or it's not looking,
but it's seeing.

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the Dao.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the way.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happened now, when
I was open to my personality

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
stuff, was that the
movement from knowing

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
the world through
conceptual structures

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and knowing it another
way, which we could use--

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
the Western word we
often use is intuitively,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I have felt that
the problems that we

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
kept creating with
our rational minds

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
were only going to be solved
by our intuitive connection

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I kept looking
for intuitive training

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to connect with that deeper and
deeper part of my being that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:90%
just knows.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But the problem that I
ran into for some years

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
was that the doorway
to the intuition

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
is through the human heart.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
leap into cosmic love

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
without dealing
with emotionality,

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
because emotionality was
a little too human for me.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I
experienced was that I

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
had used pushing
away my humanity

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%
to embrace my divinity.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted
to be intuitive,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
but the intuition, the
impeccable warrior intuitive

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
action has to come from
a blending of humanity

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and divinity.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And until I could accept
my humanity fully,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
my intuitions weren't going
to be fully in harmony

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
with the way of things.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I began to feel that what
my freedom was going to lie in

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:84%
was the creative
tension of being

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
able to see simultaneously
the perfection

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and also to experience
the pain, to see

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that there was nothing
to do and to work as hard

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
as I could to relieve suffering,
to see it was all a dream

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and still live within
the reality of it.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:90%
That creative tension.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm experiencing is
that as the faith, the faith--

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the connection to that which
you are at the deepest level

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, to the
oneness of all things,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
as that faith gets
deeper and deeper--

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
so you can dramatically,
much more freely

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
throw yourself into life.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
As long as the faith
flickers, you've

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
got to be very
tentative about the way

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.385 align:middle line:84%
you go into life,
because you're always

00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
afraid you're going to lose
your connection to the spirit.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But when that faith is
really strong, you can say,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:90%
here I come.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.918 align:middle line:84%
It's a big one,
embracing humanity.

00:05:56.918 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:90%
