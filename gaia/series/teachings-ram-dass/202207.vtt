00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I've learned
something about love.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, most of our
images of love in our society

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:90%
have to do with romantic love.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They are poetic love, they
are interpersonal love.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I love you, you love
me, we love each other.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We all give lip service to, but
hardly ever really acknowledge,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that there is another kind of
love that is not interpersonal.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
We call it conscious love,
Christ's love, God's love.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the image I have is
that when you grow up

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
in a society of conditional
love, which most of us

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
have grown up in, because of the
way in which we are socialized,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:90%
we end up very needful for love.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there's something
in us that's very hungry.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And so when we meet somebody
who has the key to unlock

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
something in us, we experience
that we are in love,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and we say I am
in love with you.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
What we're really saying
is, you are the key stimulus

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that is releasing the
mechanism in me that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
allows me to be in love.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:90%
You're my connection.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And as my connection,
I want to possess you,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
because I'm hungry to be
in this state, in my being.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I have come into the place
of love, in my being.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
beautiful, suddenly.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
But it only happens
when you are around.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And the tendency is to want
to possess the beloved, which,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
as you and I both know, is
one of the quickest ways

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
to destroy the experience.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
That love has in it
fear because somebody

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to die,
or go away, or find

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:90%
another lover, or something.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
That's interpersonal
romantic love.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:90%
But now, take that image--

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
the key stimulus
is something that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
opens you to the place in
yourself where you are love.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And through the
spiritual practices,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and through understanding
the metaphysics,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and through opening yourself,
you find yourself starting--

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
whether you call it awareness,
where you draw your awareness

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
back from thought, or through
meditation, through devotion,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
through study--

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself starting to
rest in the place of presence

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
in your being, which has the
quality of that openness,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that boundaryless-ness,
that intuitive heart

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
space where you experience
that you are in love.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, you are no longer
dependent on an external thing

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you to it.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
You are beginning to rest in it.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
So you are beginning to be love.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the social
problems that raises

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
are very interesting, because
what happens is, now, everyone

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you look at, you
are in love with.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And you don't quite
know what to do,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
because if you've been working
on an old deprivation model,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
want to collect them all.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
that you're going

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to have to give up
your deprivation model,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
because there's an
abundance of love.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.255 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to stop collecting it.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, you just
keep letting go and letting go

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.255 align:middle line:84%
and letting go until you
realize that that isn't the way,

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you're just living in
this presence of love.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing
that has closed

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
you down is the fear of
the other person's pain

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that
spiritual perspective that

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
allows you to keep your heart
open in the hell and the pain

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and the grief and
the stuff, then you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
can start to be in love
with another human being

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
without feeling a
possessive quality about it.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:90%
