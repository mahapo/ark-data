00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> See the game is now to
start to respect what's in you

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and to get over this dependency
which brings you here,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.872 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:90%
We're very straight about it.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.622 align:middle line:84%
The reason you're
here is because you

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:90%
don't know your it yet.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, what the
hell are you doing here?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't need me.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm only here to remind
you that your it.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
If I do my work
perfectly, you'll

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
walk out of here feeling
stronger than you walked in.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
With the breathing
exercise, with the following

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of the breath, with a couple
of books of the words of people

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
who've made it, and with the
needs of your incarnation

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the needs to
help things around you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to alleviate suffering and
to take care of your body

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.688 align:middle line:84%
and alleviate your
own suffering.

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So everything from then
on is your own lack

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.805 align:middle line:84%
of faith, which
you can recognize.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
You can go take a
course in meditation.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Did you say I just need
help, I need some support,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not strong enough?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But don't cater to that
thing, don't get desperate

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's still a copout.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Now at first, what
will happen is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
your meditations will start
to give you that quiet space,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or your week-long retreat will
give you that quiet space.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you will come
back into the world,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and immediately, the stuff will
start to happen to you again,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and you'll lose the space.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say I came down, and
you'll see down as less close

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to God than up.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Fallacy.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Down and up are all
part of the journey.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
When you go on a road, you will
notice the road dips and rises

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and dips and rises, but
the roads are always

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:90%
moving in a certain direction.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I think you're beginning to
recognize that your depression

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:90%
is your down states.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every state that
happens to you all the time

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
is part of the process
if you will just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
give it space to be that
rather than saying if I only

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that, I
could go on to God.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's all energy, it's
all patterns of energy.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
There are teachings in
every state you have.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You see about your
attachment to pain,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
your attachment to suffering.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
You're clinging as you
get to see all of them

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%
in vivid technicolor.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Now in fact, the only
reason the marketplace

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
brings you down is because
of your own desires.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't want
anything, as I said before,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
New York City and
a Himalayan cave

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:90%
would be exactly the same place.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You are only brought down
by your own attachments.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And the point is
that, at first, it's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
nice to get away from the
stimuli in the environment that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
keeps seducing you into
involvement at that level.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
You see, this again is a
matter of the degree of faith.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
When your faith is too
flickery, every time you forget,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:90%
you think you lost it forever.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're damned, and curse,
and you fall out of grace,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and you've blown it.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you remember again,
and, oh, phew, I'm back.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I never want to leave here.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
When your faith gets
a little stronger,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
you know you're hooked,
you really can't lose it.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you forget, you
say, far out, I forgot again.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's far out,
when you see that

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
as part of your side
in it, and that's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the business of the
balance of the feet.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
See, when your faith
is very flickery

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and you think you can get
lost for this entire lifetime

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and forget the whole thing
that brought you here,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
your weight is primarily
on the center of the circle

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
because you're terribly
afraid that you're

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
going to be pulled
back into the world.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But once you have
tasted of that piece,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
you've tasted of
the flow of energy,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you start to taste a
little bit of the bliss,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:84%
you start to taste a little
of the connectedness,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you feel the
quality of the love,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
you start to
experience the passion.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens, then the
weighting shifts just a bit,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and you actually go out
almost defiantly to get lost,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
but you can't.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the matter is if
you look in your own hearts,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:84%
most of you have not had
the faith that you in fact

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
could change, that you could
be a being of the spirit.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Because many of you had
these spiritual experiences

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of awakening, and you
had them through drugs,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you had them through something
like trauma or emotional upset,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
which gave you the feeling
they're it, the pill is it,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:90%
something's it, but I'm not it.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
interesting business

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that as you start to use
methods like the breathing in

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and breathing out, you get
more and more dependent

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
on the stuff in your
self, not in other people,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
or in books, or in the
certain kinds of experience.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But once you have
tasted the bliss,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
you have all the
ingredients you need

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:90%
to become totally realized.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.368 align:middle line:90%
