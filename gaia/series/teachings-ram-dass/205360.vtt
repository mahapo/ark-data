00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The minute you understand
that it's all yoga,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:84%
it's all a way of
coming into union,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%
everything becomes a vehicle.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Everything becomes a vehicle.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.167 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody you meet,
like, who are you meeting?

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Who are you meeting?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You walk into the bank and
you walk up to the teller,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're handing her
your deposit or your check

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:90%
to be cashed or whatever.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And who are you meeting?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Did you get caught in
walking into a bank

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a teller,
in which case, you

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:90%
reinforce that reality?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Or do you constantly keep
loosening it and loosening

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and loosening it, even
seeing a fellow soul who

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
happens to be being a teller?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
There are different
levels at which

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:90%
you can see other human beings.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And you keep playing with it all
the time and playing with it,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes another
form of loosening

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
the hold of all
the divisiveness,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
of the sharpness of the
discriminating mind, which

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.552 align:middle line:84%
keeps making a this and a that
and a this and a that and this

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And you constantly--
you're driving a car,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and you pretty soon realize
you were busy driving.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the minute you
notice that, you just sort

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
of developed a
spaciousness, and then there

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
is just driving happening.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And the car's floating
through space,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.227 align:middle line:84%
and you are floating
through space

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and is motioning and
signaling and turning.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.272 align:middle line:84%
And it's all just like
this, and you're right here.

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:90%
And you're always right here.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
because what happens

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the trippiness
goes out of life.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The rushes and trips
of life start to die.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
The idea of, wow, I'm
going to the movies.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's make love.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
You read this book.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to climb
this mountain.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to
eat these escargot.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Have you tried this wine?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take a hot bath.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to climb into bed.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these
ways that you kind of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
milk the thing for the fullness
of the flavor, of the richness.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you say, well, that's
the stuff of life, and that's--

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
it's like the romantic
storyline of your own life.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get enlightened?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Just a tremendously dramatic
storyline, you know.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
What will he do
when he grows up?

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, he'll marry, won't he?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
as you develop

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
equanimity, first it's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
like reading a story,
you know, his story.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And the present is
just like the past.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just, what
do we do now, you know?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like a continuing
drama on the telly.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you
just start to feel cheated.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have been
preserving a few trips.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to give
up a lot of the ones

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.366 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to give up anyway.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You used to bowl, but
you got tired of bowling.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:90%
So, well, I don't bowl anymore.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
something happens.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:90%
You start to just develop--

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little bit like
a dark night of the soul.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the point where you have
started to die to the world,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't yet fully
tasted or viewed divinity.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way
in which you were

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
used to getting
your gratification

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
from sensual
manipulation of things--

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
from color and sound
and taste and skin

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and playing with
thoughts and all of this,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and they all start
to turn into stuff.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Just stuff.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.442 align:middle line:90%
And it's more of it.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:90%
More of it.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went through years
where the minute I wake up,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I turn on classical
music, and then

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.563 align:middle line:84%
I would play cello
quartets-- in the old days

00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%
when I could play the cello.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd have music
in my office and music

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in my automobile, and I
just was full of always

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
into Vivaldi and Mozart and
Bruch and Bartok and Hindemith,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:90%
and it was all, hmm.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and
smoking special cigars

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:90%
and going here for the octave.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
started to disappear.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the point
where I could sit in a room.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The simpler the decor
became, the better for me.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I got so that a simple white
room, I was quite pleased.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gee, what
happened to my aesthetic?

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.727 align:middle line:90%
What happened to my love of art?

00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:90%
What happened to all that stuff?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Did it all-- it
was all beautiful,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
but just the white
wall was beautiful.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But at first I felt
cheated because I

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
was used to having
all those things

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and used to filling my
consciousness with all

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it all started
to turn into nothing.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was a period where I
said, I wish I could go back.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could make believe
I didn't know what I know,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and I could go back and
enjoy all this stuff

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of innocent
greed or sensual delight again,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't do it.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And that was just stage.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it came to the point
where everything is what it is.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing and
it's everything.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's back where it's all
delightful and all empty.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would love a nice dinner,
and I couldn't care less.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I no longer need to
get lost into it in order

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to milk it so that
life becomes meaningful

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
because just this is enough.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's when enough is enough
because I lived for years

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
with it more was better.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.067 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of getting
old and, my God,

00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
able to do this anymore,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and then I can't do
this and doing that.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And then getting to the
point where, OK, OK.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:90%
