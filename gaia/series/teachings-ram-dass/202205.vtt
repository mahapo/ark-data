00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When I look at
social institutions,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I see that the basic
social institution is still

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
the individual human heart,
that you and I connect with

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
the universe through
our intuitive wisdom,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:90%
not through our analytic mind.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is that connection
to the source that

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
imbues social structures
with living truth

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and with living juice.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It is up to people who are
aware of the dissonance,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
because they are in tune and
connected with the universe

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
through that doorway
of intuitive wisdom

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that can constantly be drawing
the social institutions

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
into line with the deeper
wisdom of the universe.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
collective consciousness

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
in which there are certain
ways of seeing reality.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And our value is that we can do
two things simultaneously, work

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
to extricate ourselves from
it, and at the same moment

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:90%
participate in it.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is very difficult.
And what I am suggesting to you

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is what I see my own work
to be is to figure out what

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
qualifications, what do I need
to cultivate in myself to be

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:90%
that instrument in the society?

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that a lot
of us have done inner work

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or connected
through whatever way

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
with metaphysical perspectives,
with frames of reference that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:84%
give us a sense of
something larger

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
than the immediate
power of the individual.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And we also have connected
with frames of reference

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to
experientially know that there

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:90%
are no them, there's only us.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only is there only us,
but if you've really gone deep

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
into mysticism in
the experiential way,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
you realize there's only me,
or I. There's only one of it.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So that your compassion towards
other beings and other things

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
where they're suffering
is not awakened out

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.662 align:middle line:84%
of pity and empathy as a
separate entity saying,

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll take care of them.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So it won't come to me, I
don't want to be like that.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But it arises out of a sense
of identity with all things.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's not their suffering.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It's our suffering.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
