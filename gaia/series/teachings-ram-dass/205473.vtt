00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at death and you
see it's the heaviest melodrama

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
sucks everybody in.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
You might be very, very
spacious about everything.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Ah, working.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.847 align:middle line:90%
Ah, children are playing.

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.014 align:middle line:84%
But you come to death, and
it's suddenly, I'm dying.

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:84%
At first, when you were
trying to get high,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
you were trying to push away the
things that brought you down.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Then when you want
to get free, you

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
see that the only things that
bring you down are yourself.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's bringing you down
but your own attachments.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So that the things that get
you in life are the secret.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They're the clue to your
stash of attachments of mind.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see
how each thing that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:84%
gets you is showing you where
you're holding, where you're

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
still clinging to a model
of this versus that, of I

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
want this, but I
don't want that.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I like this, but
I don't like that.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And the quietness of mind is
standing behind preferences.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You stand behind the
this versus the that,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%
the yin versus the yang.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
All of the polarities, you
stand in the one behind the two.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So now once you want
to be free, at first

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
you want to hang out with
people to keep you high.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Later, you want to confront
the fires that catch you.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
You want to purify
through those fires.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You just find yourself drawn
towards the things that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
are still catching you so
that you can get to the point

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
where you can be in them,
but not lost in them,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
where you can keep your space
even when you're in them.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And dying is one of the big
ones that sucks everybody in.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the work
is developing the ability

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to be with somebody that's
dying or be dying yourself

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and stay very clear
and very present.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Because those that
are from religions

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that focus on the
moment of death, which

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is most of the religions that
have reincarnation in them,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
see life as a preparation
for the moment of death.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
They see that.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And they see, as Don
Juan says, that you keep

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
death over your left shoulder.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
You live each moment as
if it's your last moment.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Not in a kind of macabre,
horrible, negative way,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
but in a way in
which each moment is

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the one where if it's
to be your death moment,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:90%
it's, ah, here I am.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Very clear.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm dying.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Now the body is dropping.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Like the Tibetans
in describing--

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan Book of the Dead,
they describe the dying moments

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about the
Earth element leaves,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and you feel heaviness.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The water element
leaves, you feel dryness.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The fire element leaves,
you feel coldness.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:90%
The air element leaves.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Your out breath is not
followed by an in breath.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:10%
What follows after
the incarnation is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
what's created by the
attachments of the moment

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:10%
of death, so that
those beings that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:10%
are going to go
into the white light

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.188 align:middle line:10%
are about three
quarters of the way

00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:10%
turned around before
the moment of death.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
They're already right
here with all of it,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:90%
even before they die.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So that a lot of the work
you're doing in a lifetime

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is the preparation for
the moment of death,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and keeping death present
enriches the moment of life.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
That the optimum
way to be healed

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
is the optimum way to die, which
is your full consciousness.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But your full
consciousness listens, does

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:84%
what it can to preserve
the precious human body,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%
but also allows what is to be.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
lose it because they

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
are so attached to which way
it all goes all the time.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I work with people that are
having, like, a slow illness,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:84%
terminal illness, and they're
losing their motor ability.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And each stage
they lose, I watch

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
some people who are able
to open to the new stage

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and say, ah, so.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And those people don't suffer.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I watch somebody
who looks at the shoes

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
in the closet they'll
never wear again

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and sits around feeling
sorry because they

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
can't wear those shoes anymore.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They're holding onto the model
of who they were a moment ago.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The minute you let
go into what is--

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:90%
ah.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The minute you hold on to
a model of what might be

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
or what ought to be or
what should be or what was,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It's that disparity that
creates the suffering.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So that any time
there is suffering,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a clue to where
your mind is holding.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Finally, suffering
is the tastiest clues

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
about your stash,
and so with death.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
People that open to each stage
of consciousness and move

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:90%
with it don't suffer at all.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.
