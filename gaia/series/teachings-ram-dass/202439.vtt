00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a line, a quote
from Aeschylus, "The Oresteia,"

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
saying, "In our sleep, pain,
which we cannot forget,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
falls drop by drop
upon the heart until,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in our own despair,
against our will,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.835 align:middle line:84%
comes wisdom through
the awful grace of God."

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
The awful grace.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
To even sense that
suffering has a function.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
That when one understands that
you are a spiritual entity that

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:84%
has taken birth and that
your curriculum on Earth

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
is to awaken out of the illusion
of your own separateness

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to recognize who you really are
behind who you appear to be,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
then you see that the stuff
of life is the curriculum.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the stuff
that's offered to you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
through which you can get free.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has changed,
as you can see,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
from the earlier
model was originally,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I was always trying to get high.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I understood that I
wanted to be free, not high.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
mystic literature,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
it says there's
nowhere to stand.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
question is, is it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
possible to keep your
heart open in hell?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Is there some way that you
can become compassionate such

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that you don't lose
your joy, and yet, you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:90%
can keep your heart open?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the art form.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the balancing
between these planes.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the being in the
world but not of the world.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
That is the seeing that
it's all perfect, including

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
the suffering,
including your heart's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:90%
pain about the suffering.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Including your yearning
as an individual

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to do what you can to
relieve the suffering,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
even though you
understand the suffering

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:90%
is what the suffering is.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But the perfection of it
includes your human heart.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't deny your humanity.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And you live with that paradox.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.865 align:middle line:84%
You stretch to
embrace that paradox.

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.277 align:middle line:84%
So when you want
to get high, then

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
you push it down because
it brings you down.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
When you want to
get free, you see

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing
that brings you down

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is your own mind because the
phenomena are just phenomena.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
They're just happening.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
What you do with them is
what you do with them.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when you want
to be free enough,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
you invite the phenomena that
will catch you towards you.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:90%
You maybe not invite them.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But when they come,
you work with them

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because they show you the
way the mind is creating

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:90%
your problem, your suffering.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Your job is to quiet your
mind enough so that you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
can escape from
the waddle you have

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.228 align:middle line:90%
of who you think you there.

00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
There are two structures
that are involved.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Two processes.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
One is quieting
the mind, and one

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is opening the heart so it's
not as armored as it was before.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And the balancing when the
quiet mind and the open heart

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
is that balance
is the compassion

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that allows other people to
become free of their suffering

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:90%
through your presence.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they know you
hear what they're feeling

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:90%
because you have a human heart.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:84%
If your heart is closed, your
emotional heart's closed,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel
you're there at all.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But then they also
experience the spaciousness

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of your awareness.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:90%
That isn't lost in the drama.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
If you would free
another from suffering,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to work on yourself
to extricate yourself

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.823 align:middle line:90%
from your suffering.

00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand very clearly,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.653 align:middle line:84%
what are the causes
of your suffering?

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The causes of the
suffering at first

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
would seem to be hunger,
or pain, or relationship,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But later, you see,
it is not those.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.445 align:middle line:84%
It is what you do with those
that is where the suffering

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
is./ it's what your
mind does with them.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to become
interested in quieting

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
your own mind and
getting behind that.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
See, behind the two, behind
the dark and light, behind good

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and evil, behind Yab and
yum or male and female,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
behind all those forces of
positive and negative energy,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:90%
behind the two is the one.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:90%
There's only one behind the two.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And only when you can extricate
yourself from seeing the two

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and come behind it when
you're quiet enough

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that you experience
the one looking out

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
on the manifestation
into two and the many

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and appreciate the
perfection of it.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And when that is a valid,
intuitive experience,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:90%
then it's called faith.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And that connection
to that reality

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
allows you to handle this
reality without flinching.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:90%
You asked me, am I happy?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I am as happy as I've
ever been in my life.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you sad?

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I am deeply sad.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And life has a
horrible beauty to it.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It has all things all at once.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
This moment is so thick.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
This moment has in it
the screaming cries

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:90%
of prisoners being tortured.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It has in it the beauty of a
newborn baby in the mother's

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:90%
arms at the breast.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It has all of this right
here in the second.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
If you say, well, it's
this but not that--

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
push something away,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:90%
you have to armor your heart.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you armor your
heart, you don't get fed.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
What other people see
as things to avoid,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
when you want to be free,
you may not court them,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
but when they come
along, you are

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
delighted to work with
them because they show you

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
your little secret stash
where your mind is clinging.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the job is keep
quieting the mind,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of the
places that it's clinging,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and coming back into the moment.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Coming quieter just
in the present moment.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.072 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
matter of the heart.

00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:90%
And the matter of the heart--

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
really, it's so sweet.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
That heart, that intuitive
heart place, is now real.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It's now where I live.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And what has
happened is that when

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I look out at the universe,
I see it as the beloved.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I begin to love what I see.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
As long as I was just
in my separateness,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.383 align:middle line:84%
I was frightened
of the universe.

00:07:08.383 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I was frightened of the pain,
the suffering, the violence,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
because I was frightened,
because I was attached

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
to avoiding my own death.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:84%
But when you come into that
intuitive heart, that presence,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:90%
that isthmus.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no time.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no space.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no life.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no death.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a joy of just
being part of it all.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Of being it all.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
aversion or attachment.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
There's the writings of the
third Chinese patriarch of zen.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Just the first line of it.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:90%
The Great Way, it says.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Great Way, capital
G, W. Great Way

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.860 align:middle line:84%
is not difficult for those
who have no preferences.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
what you and I can

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
offer other human beings is the
loving, spacious presence that

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
allows them the space to come
up for air out of the entrapping

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
roles they are imprisoned
in if they choose.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any right
to force them to come up.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't take another
person's suffering away.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But you can become
an environment

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in which other people
can come up for air.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
