00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What a subtle
process, this ashram,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
dealing with that which
is formless through form.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Dealing with the way which is
uncharted and most ancient.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
How we eat, and walk, and
talk, and play, and work.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Exploring how to take the moment
to moment experiences of life

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and see them as passing
show, as graceful lessons,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
as a divine offering.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't come away
from this ashram

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:84%
with an intellectual
appreciation of karma yoga,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
but with just the sense
that it's possible.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to be in
the world yet not of it.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
be truly involved

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in the process of life
with honor and with delight

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.762 align:middle line:90%
but with no attachment.

00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
review daily actions

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and see them as a joyful
dialogue with god,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
with guru, with self.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
That perhaps we can
bring into focus

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the tiny space that
surrounds all of the acts--

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
space of mindfulness, of
clarity, of quietness.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And in that space
to appreciate as we

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
would appreciate a sunrise, a
sunset, or a moon, or a fire.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The daily dance
of life, learning

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to reverence the horrible
beauty of existence.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
When we leave the mountain,
if we have learned what

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
is to be learned,
truly have become it,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and if we have become it,
we need not remember it.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
For to remember is to take
you away from the moment.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
For memories are but moldering
butterflies in our collection.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And if the message
of this ashram

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
has been heard in
our bones, the going

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
will be as joyful as the
being here and as meaningful.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
For in every
experience of light,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is just the information you need
for the next step of awakening.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And one deciphers the message
not with the intellect,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:90%
but with the intuitive heart.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And the intuitive
heart functions

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:90%
when the mind is quiet.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So the ashram is but a
continuing part of the journey.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
There are many of
us on the path.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:10%
We come together for a moment,
acknowledging our existence,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:10%
sharing the joy of knowing
we're on the path together.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
We go apart, not to stop
the journey but to do

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:90%
what we each need to do.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But just recognizing that there
are other pilgrims on the path

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
means that as long as you enter
into the space of the path,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:90%
you can never be lonely.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
For we are a community,
not a community

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of form, or a time, or space,
nevertheless a community.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%
We hear each other.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We look in each other's eyes,
and we recognize one another.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
We stand next to each other
in the silence we know

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and with a quiet joy that
comes from being together.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There have been hard moments,
and tough edges, and lack

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
of compassion shown
here and there

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:90%
because we must face our stuff.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:90%
We still have stuff.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
All of us have our work of
incarnation in the world.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Finally for each of us, the
world must become our ashram.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And all human beings on it
have to become our satsanga

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:90%
or asanga.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You just accept that you are
not going back to anything.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:90%
You are going towards something.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:90%
There is no going back.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But in our real journey
towards liberation,

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.455 align:middle line:90%
I wish you all godspeed.

00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Myself, too.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
