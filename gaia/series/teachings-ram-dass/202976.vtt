00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a time just before
my mother died when we were

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
having the 40th anniversary
for my mother and father.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And we had made a beautiful
gift book of their life

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
together with pictures and
stories and art and so on.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
And I had the book, and I
was bringing it to brunch.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Their anniversary was
January 1st, New Year's Day.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:10%
And the night before we
had had a group of us,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:10%
our experimental research group,
had had a large LSD session.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.428 align:middle line:90%
And I had timed it wrong.

00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:90%
We started a little late.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning, I
was sort of peaking

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:90%
rather than on my way down.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked in the
mirror, there was no face.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was in an
interesting position

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
because this was a
family gathering.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't going to miss it.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So I got into this metal box
and drove to my brother's house

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in this foreign country
that I had never

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.895 align:middle line:84%
seen before holding
this snake in my hands.

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the house, and
I was wearing sunglasses

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
because my pupils, of
course, were very dilated.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that since New Year's
Eve is a time of celebration

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.145 align:middle line:84%
they would just assume
I had been drinking.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So I walked in, and
what I walked into

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
was a forest lair with
everybody in a very simian way.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my grandmother looked
like an old aged monkey.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And she was like
scratching herself.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.535 align:middle line:84%
And all of the family
looked like monkeys.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just my
mind suggesting this.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they all turned
into these simian forms.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't blow my cover.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I just said oh god,
got any tomato juice?

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I drink a lot, you know?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
So we sat down for brunch.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And my family is a family
that expressed their love

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
through needling each other.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So my brother, who was a lawyer,
was sitting across from me.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
I was a professor of psychology.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And his opening gambit was well,
Rich, how's the nut business?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was I
saw his mouth open,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and out of his
mouth came an arrow.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And the arrow very slowly
came across the table,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because my time
dimension had shifted.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was very slow.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And with my mind, I reached
up and I took the arrow,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and I put it down
next to my spoon.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked at him.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I saw what a
beautiful monkey he was.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, your children

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:90%
have become so beautiful.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And out of my mouth
came my heart.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And it went across and
it hit him in the head.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:10%
And there was a look
of shock in his head

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:10%
because I wasn't
playing by the rules.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to how's
the shyster business

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we do about lawyers.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, he says all
your knowledge,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
you don't seem to
be growing any hair.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Another arrow came over.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up and put
it next to the spoon.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, you and Helen
have just done so well in life.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Must be really pleasing to you.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Another heart went
across and hit him.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
look of shock.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.122 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else
was doing the arrows.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
looked at the table,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
there were arrows
flying everywhere.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.883 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was the
form of expression.

00:03:54.883 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
In the afternoon after brunch,
we went outside at the end

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to go home and everybody
was out by their cars.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't leave.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
leave each other.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought when
I got in the car

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
probably nothing
unusual happened.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.789 align:middle line:84%
I just think it happened because
I'm a perceiver that's drugged,

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.527 align:middle line:90%
So I'll be quiet.

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, they
started calling one another.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And everybody said wasn't
that an extraordinary--

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
don't we have a
wonderful family?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that it
only took one consciousness

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:10%
to shift the game of one person
who was free of the reactivity

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:10%
within the model.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting when
you look at social structures

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to see where somebody
could be inside

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that could be free
of the structure

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently and not
in a defensive way

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or a reactive way, but
really be free of it

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to bring another quality
into the situation.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is part
of the essence of what

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:90%
the helping act is about.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about service and
help is the ability to be there

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and to appreciate
the predicament

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of other human beings without
getting trapped in reactivity

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So that you are always
present as another being

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
for that person.
