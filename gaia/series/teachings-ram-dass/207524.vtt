00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> As my own faith deepens, I
feel less desire to structure

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:90%
these gatherings.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm much more aware
of how the situation offers

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
into itself a living truth
for us to work with, not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
get so trapped in
our suffering, really

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
taste the joyness, the joy
of the way things are--

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
the joy of the trees, and
the river, and the steam,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and the joy of life.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And you and I come
together out of our lives

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
in which every one of us-- all
of me, and all of the staff,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and all of you get
caught again, and again,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and again in our
minds, basically.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Because there are just
phenomena in the universe.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we make
of them what we do.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And we come here in order
to give each other support

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to examine our minds.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Part of our addiction is we
often feel much of the time

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that our hearts are not fully,
abundantly, compassionately

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
open.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We should feel safe enough to
really love, to be in love.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And part of our addiction is
we know that's the way it is.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And we come together
because our hearts hurt.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We may be efficient, and
smart, and in control,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and doing it all perfectly.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But if our hearts aren't open,
it's not the living truth.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to something
that is not conceptual.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to
being heart full,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
being quiet of mind, to being
attuned, being in balance,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
being in harmony with the
forces of the universe.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And we all sense the
potential of that.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why I come here.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:90%
This is satsang or sangha.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the community
of beings where

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not weird to
say that you're

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:90%
interested in these things.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
embarrassed among you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to say that I would really
like to be with god.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I'd like to be god.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I am god.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
To lose our hearts,
and lose our minds,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and lose our bodies,
how much people that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
are in this particular kind of
addiction lose their bodies.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They get so into their minds
and so into their hearts.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And they forget that
they're an incarnate.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
They forget the
joy of incarnation,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
but to move with joy, and
to tune through the body,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and feel your way into your
humanity, to your animalness.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And we are addicted
to the possibility

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.935 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the challenges
of our life as gifts.

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm talking about
the real challenges--

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the challenge of health,
challenge of death,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the challenge of other
people's sufferings,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the challenge of loss,
grief, the challenge of work,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:90%
challenge of relationships.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you see your entire
life as a curriculum

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:90%
for your own transformation?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
How often do you remember
that, when you're really

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of something
that is really heavy duty

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's got you,
really got you.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.195 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, does the
remembering have much power?

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that in the
30 years that I've been aware

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility that being
in an incarnation can be free,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that has become the
dominant theme of life.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I can feel the
relationship of that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to suffering, to the whole
situation in the world.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that
in 30 years, there

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.925 align:middle line:90%
has sure been a lot of change.

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not a controlled
experiment.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody else.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But there is certainly
the profound experience

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of lightness, spaciousness,
of playfulness, of emptiness,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
of compassion, of
courage, of the ability

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to cling less and
less to this and that.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's true, in one minute,
you could become enlightened.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that in one
minute, you can forget.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And most of us in this
gathering have tasted.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.570 align:middle line:90%
We have tasted.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're all here in
a clean-up operation.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to
integrate what we've tasted

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of our lives.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Graceful.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:90%
It's full of grace.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I think at the moment
of how few people in the world

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity, because
their survival is taken care

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of, have the good karma
to want to explore this,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
you've got to examine, why
did you choose this one?

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
you know already?

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.566 align:middle line:84%
And you just came here to
be reassured that you know,

00:05:59.566 --> 00:06:01.795 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I
really come together,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%
because we are fellow addicts.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We are addicted to
a shared feeling

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that there is the possibility
that we could be free.
