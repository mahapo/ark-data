00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a point where I
was in India with 30 or so other

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And over time I got
to hate all of them,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
be with Maharaji,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
taking up his time.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that they
were very adharmic,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't stand them.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I really loathed all of them.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Maharaji kept calling me
up each day, many times,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and he'd say Ram
Dass, love everyone.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, yes, Maharaji.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.388 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say, jao, go away.

00:00:49.388 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Then he'd call me up a few
minutes later, and he'd say,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Ram Dass, tell the truth.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Because he always kept catching
me at lies, social lies.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And hour after hour,
I'd get called up.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Tell the truth.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Love everyone.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Until finally the juxtaposition
of these two things

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
came together, and I
thought, well, the truth

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:90%
is I don't love everyone.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Now what am I going to do?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
He says, tell the truth,
and love everyone.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I usually do is I
make believe I love everyone.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I surrender the truth
a little bit, oh hello,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
while I'm really
hating your guts.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I do it the
other way for a change?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:90%
So I'll grow a little bit.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'll tell the truth.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So I started to tell everybody
how much I hated them all.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I said Maharaji, I can't
stand any of those people.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:90%
I hate them all.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:90%
And I hate me.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I hate everybody but you.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%
He says, you love me?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, I love you.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And I started to sob.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean the tension
just released,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and I could tell
him I loved him,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and I just loved him so much.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And tears started to
stream down his face.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Then he looked at
me and he said,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I told you to love everyone.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but you
told me to tell the truth.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is I
don't love everyone.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.745 align:middle line:84%
And he came up to me nose to
nose, and eyeball to eyeball.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
He says, Ram Dass, love
everyone and tell the truth.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
What I saw in front
of me was a coffin.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the coffin was
who I thought I was.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm somebody who the truth
is, I don't love everyone.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I saw him saying
when you get finished

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
being who you think you
are, who you will be

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
is someone who loves everyone
and that's the truth.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
You will rest in truth, which
is love where everyone is.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're busy
being somebody separate,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to love
that one and not

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.438 align:middle line:84%
love that one, because
you're going to be

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:90%
caught discriminating mind.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Third Chinese patriarch
says the Great Way is not

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
difficult for those who
have no preferences.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
When love and hate
are both absent,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
everything becomes
clear and undisguised.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But make the
slightest distinction,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.105 align:middle line:84%
and heaven and earth are
set infinitely apart.

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over at all
these people I hated.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
my heart was so open,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that behind what
I hated in each of them,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.678 align:middle line:90%
I loved them all incredibly.

00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And here were these
beautiful beings.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:90%
They were trying for the light.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:90%
They were reaching.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They were these
incredible souls.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw the innocence of each
of them behind the guile.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw that between
me and that expression

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of that love, in the courtyard
I saw this huge mountain.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And the only word for
the mountain was pride.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Because Maharaji didn't
say, work it out with them.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, love them.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
He didn't say, save face.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
He just said, love them.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So then he sent me across
the courtyard to eat.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And then he called
all of them over.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, go
touch Ram Dass' feet.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.915 align:middle line:90%
He's a great saint.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So they all came over and
touched my feet, one at a time.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And I hated them.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean that reawakened
the hatred of all of them.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew they
were hating, me and they

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
weren't really doing
it, and all that stuff.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.753 align:middle line:84%
So I saw my predicament
and I just thought,

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
well, I really ought to make
at least an effort, you know.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll try.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And my guru said it.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I do it?

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So I had some apples
that he had thrown at me.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I cut them up
into little pieces

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and I decided to feed each
person a piece of apple.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But I knew, because
I had been trained

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
as a yogi, that to feed somebody
with anger in your heart

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:90%
is like giving them poison.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I cut up the apple, and I
went to feed it to each person.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at each person,
and I would feel the anger.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for my
anger, which was righteous,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:90%
of course I was right, always.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:90%
We all are, aren't you?

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
where I loved them.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just would sit
with that whole thing

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
until I would just let go
of the hold of that anger,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
without working it out,
without trying to save face,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:84%
without getting them to give a
little and me to give a little,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:90%
so we all end up--

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I just gave up.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I just loved them.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.609 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It took me about
an hour and a half

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to put an apple in everybody's
mouth, 30 people's mouths.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Now since that time,
I used to be so angry

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
all the time that Hari Dass
Baba, who used to say he

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
could never stay
in the room with me

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.607 align:middle line:84%
for more than a few minutes,
because the anger would

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
make him sick, physically sick,
the repressed anger in me.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, I get
angry all the time.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But I let go much
faster, because I

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
see the anger as a
place where I got caught

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
with a model in my head
of how a person should be,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:90%
other than the way they are.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can look
at elms, oaks, and pines,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and pinions, and magnolias; and
you can say, look at that tree.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't say, I wish that
pine were a magnolia tree.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But you get to humans,
and you're continually

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
deciding how everybody
should be, other than the way

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
they are, instead
of appreciating

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
this is a perfect John, and
this is a perfect Helen.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a perfect Bill, perfect
Leonard, perfect example

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:90%
of that species of neurosis.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:90%
