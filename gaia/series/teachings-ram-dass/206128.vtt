00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me what I've
been speaking to is the issue

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:84%
of the use of psychedelics for
inner work, for spiritual work.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of things
I should point out about that.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:10%
One is that a lot of the reason
we used psychedelics because

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:10%
of the monolithic quality of the
belief systems of the culture

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:10%
are no longer the way it is,
that relative reality, which

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:10%
was awakened '50s and
'60s and came back in,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
but there was a lot of stuff
that forced relative reality

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:10%
as consciousness.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has mainstreamed
in the society.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll pick up a
hitchhiker, and I'll

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
realize that her consciousness
is just right where

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:90%
mine is all the time.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And it thinks what
right have you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
got to have this kind
of consciousness.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I drugged myself out of
my existence to get here

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and meditated and went to India,
and you've got this thing.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized it's
like a lot of the stuff

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that you took chemicals to
do from this point of view

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of awakening out of a reality
when that was your motivation.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is much
more accessible now.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's maybe overly
strong thing to say,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.245 align:middle line:84%
it's an anachronism, but it's
certainly not as critical.

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The next fact is that we
know that set and setting

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
in chemical use is critical,
that the set of your mind

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and the setting in
which you do your work

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
determines the nature
of the experience.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics, particularly
the tryptamines,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
override habits of thought.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But where you go with that
is where you go with that.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:90%
That has to do with your karma.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment
in this culture,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
the setting is really a little
paranoid about drug use.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, it may not be
the best spiritual practice

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:10%
around these days because
you don't have enough control

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:10%
of all the variables.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I think you realize
methods are methods,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and some methods are
useful and some aren't

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
at any moment in history.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I would
say is that my experience

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
from the '60s and on
is that a lot of people

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
experimented or
used chemicals when

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have a good
ground to come back into.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
places you can bad trip.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
One's on the way out, and
one's on the way back.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
You bad trip on the way
out because everything

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
starts to dissolve
including you,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's very disturbing
to some people.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
As Tim said, I die
so hard each time.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:84%
The bad trip on the way back
is you've been out la la land,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's been beautiful and
one and exquisite and God

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.788 align:middle line:84%
And you come back, and
you look in your bedroom

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:02.817 align:middle line:84%
and in your life and
in your relationships,

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:90%
and you don't want to come back.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the other bad trip.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the bad trip
going out with a guide

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and with appropriate
preparation,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:90%
you needn't have that.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
You can use that, and it'll
be a productive experience.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The bad trip coming
back is partly

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
if you have used the chemical
to escape this plane.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And if escape is
your motivation,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.022 align:middle line:84%
you really can
anticipate you're going

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to have some trouble
along the way,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to keep
moving pretty fast.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
How you don't get into an
escape thing is to get ground.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And so for young people
who are very busy

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
with new relationships, with
economics, with curriculum,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
with career, with figuring
out how to play it,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
often the ground isn't
really a stable one

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
from which to do this
kind of experimentation.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So my statement has always
been become somebody

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
before you try to
become nobody, that is,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
don't try to up level when your
ego isn't developed because it

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
takes a certain
kind of ego strength

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind of work, which
is interesting since it's

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:90%
overriding ego.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say to each person get
as educated as much as you can

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:90%
and make your own decisions.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
I am very much opposed
to any legislation

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
about human consciousness.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I really think
individuals should

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
have a right to do with their
consciousness as they will.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean if I look at
drug use in inner city

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and in the middle class, I
see that in the inner city,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.862 align:middle line:84%
the lack of economic and social
opportunity and all of that

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and pushing against
something that's not giving

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.695 align:middle line:84%
and the society where
you're being confronted

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
with television, with all
the possibilities, none

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:84%
of which you can have, I can see
that drugs are used to escape.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I see in the middle
class where they can have stuff

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of the
middle class people

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
got what they thought the
American dream promised them,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
at which point they
would feel a certain way,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and then they don't feel it.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.242 align:middle line:90%
They got the success.

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
They worked hard for
it, and they got it,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's not enough.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it's more
is better, and that

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
is the motivation for the
drug use at that point.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And the whole issue of
voluntary simplicity,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
which only comes at a certain
level of human consciousness

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:84%
where people begin to
move towards simplicity so

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that there's enough for
everyone, those kind of thought

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
forms, those come out of a
certain level of evolution.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And part of the drug problem
is the escape mentality

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in the society because there
are some deep-rooted lack

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of satisfaction in the mythology
of this culture at this moment.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And within that whole
context is our opportunity

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to get it all together and to
be present in that situation.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.043 align:middle line:90%
