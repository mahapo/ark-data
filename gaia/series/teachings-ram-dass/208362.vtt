00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of this plane of
reality is that the only beings

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of all the beings in the
cosmos that take birth on these

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
planes, on planes at all,
are beings who have desires.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And those desires always
have to do with something.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you desire
something, there is suffering.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you extricate
yourself from the suffering

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is by extricating
yourself from being

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.565 align:middle line:90%
identified with those desires.

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:90%

Buddha's Four Noble
Truths is all suffering,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the cause of suffering
is desire, give up desire

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:90%
and you end suffering.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And here's the Eightfold Path
of how to give up desire.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That's all of
Buddhism right there.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:84%
The game is not to
stop desire but to stop

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
being identified with desire
because desires turn out

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to be thoughts.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Go behind your
thoughts is another way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of saying give up desire.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the Bodhisattva vow

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of Buddhism which
says, "I vow to relieve

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of
all beings," doesn't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
become a vow of a great
good social concern person.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.673 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a statement
of the obvious

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in the same way the Ten
Commandments are a statement

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.832 align:middle line:90%
of the obvious at that point.

00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:52.748 align:middle line:90%

00:01:52.748 --> 00:01:58.545 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.545 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So here you're in
the predicament

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
now that you're vowing
to end suffering.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The best way you can do
it, as I said earlier,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
is to work on yourself
to get yourself

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
free of those illusions so
that you can free others.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Because a person that's
in quicksand can't free

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:90%
another person from quicksand.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm concerned, where
I am in my stage of the game,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:90%
there's only two of us left--

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
there's me and my guru.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And everybody I meet in the
universe is my guru in drag.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It catches you with
every desire you've got.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
You want power?

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
It'll give you a power.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Because your desires
end up determining what

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:90%
you see in the universe.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's all you see, anyway.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the only aspect
of the guru you see.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're hungry,
you walk down the street,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
all you notice is
bakeries or pizza stand.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't know notice
hardware stores from there.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
your entire universe

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
is peopled by the projections
of your own desires.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the only ones you
ever notice in the world.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's always your guru coming
to you saying, "oh, you still

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
got that desire, huh?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.726 align:middle line:84%
I'll come and let you
work with it some more."

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly enough,
when you get to the point

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
where you're finally at the
end point of that sequence I've

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.000 align:middle line:84%
been talking about,
you recognize

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.167 align:middle line:90%
that suffering is grace.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
That the only reason you suffer
is because you want something,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
you're holding somewhere,
you've got a stash of desire

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And all that suffering
says is, I caught you.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You only suffer
because you're holding.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So you end up
realizing that we are

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.932 align:middle line:84%
born into this plane
because of our desires

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and all the suffering
that's laid on us because

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of our desires is the teaching
that's given to us to free us

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%
from the desires.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we finish doing that,
we don't keep doing it again.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.835 align:middle line:84%
And we do everything
we can to relieve

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of all beings,
and the best thing we can do

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.188 align:middle line:90%
is work on ourselves.

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what you're
doing for anybody else,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
realize that it is
primarily work on yourself,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
and that working
for them is merely

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the instrument through
which you're doing.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've heard any
of that, here we are.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
We're here where you
can go and you can come

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:84%
but there is nowhere
to go because we're all

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
stuck in this stew
together for eternity.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody you think
you are, you aren't.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
In every way you think
you're going, you're not.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And behind all the hocus pocus
of your melodrama and mime,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
here we are.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And we'll dance on.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
We'll do the divine
dance of god.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
The Lila, the dance because
that's what this is, the dance.
