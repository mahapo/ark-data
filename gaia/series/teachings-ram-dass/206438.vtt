[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The way in which one
responds to suffering,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
since there is an infinite
amount and there's enough to go

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:84%
around, the question of which
suffering becomes the suffering

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Or at this moment,
there isn't really

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:90%
a rational process involved.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
You can't decide this one is
a 0.3 and that one's a 0.2.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And out of that comes, if you
trust it enough, an intuitive

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
yes or an intuitive no,
because you and I can't respond

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to all the suffering around.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're sitting
around constantly judging,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
is this the worst suffering,
is this the critical suffering,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:90%
you do yourself in.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you think I have
to cover all sufferings,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
realize you are just part
of the web of compassion.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like there is
a web of suffering,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:90%
there's a web of compassion.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you become more and
more open, and more and more

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:84%
than all of it is, so
people distant aren't them.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:90%
They're still us.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of one process.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You get to the point
where you're not

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
sitting around judging that
you're using your time the best

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
way possible, because it'll
drive you up the wall.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You begin to trust your
just intuitive response

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
at the situation.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And you say, yes.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And now-- and you don't even
rationally necessarily know why

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:90%
you say that--

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:84%
when you open yourself,
it all comes towards you.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And the question is whether
or not you get overwhelmed,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
or you collect it, or you
burn out, or what happens?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you don't take
it personally, nothing happens.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just an impersonal process.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a way of
being with suffering,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:84%
and the Bhagavad Gita
has two injunctions

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
that I have found very useful.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
One of them is,
be not identified

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
with being the actor.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
That is, tune to the
way in which, whatever

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
it is coming through you,
don't get into channeling

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but just get
into the feeling of you're open

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
and you're saying,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
may I serve, or may
I be an instrument?

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Not my, but I will,
whichever one you want.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you stand to
get out of the way,

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and you watch this
stuff happen around you.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other
injunction of the Gita

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is, be not attached to
the fruits of the action.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Because if you work to
bring about something,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
it is natural to be attached
to whether that happens or not.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And to begin to
reorient your life,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
so you realize you're doing
what you're doing because you're

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:90%
doing what you're doing.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's aimed
towards an outcome,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
but whether that outcome
will ever happen,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
is not totally in your control.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And you'll do yourself in if
you spend a lot of mind time

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
worrying about what it will
happen rather than doing it.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the concept in
the east of doing one's Dharma

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
you do the thing, you
listen, and out of listening,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%
comes response.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the
response, you're

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
fully in that moment
of that response.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And how it comes out
is how it comes out.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I do lots of things that fail,
but it's not doing me in.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
But I realize that the
nature of the contract

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:84%
is, I'm doing this as
well as I can do this.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You're doing that as
well as you can do that.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
What you do with this is
your problem, not mine.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not my karma.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It's your karma.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
If I did it as purely as I
can without the intention

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
of manipulation, then I don't
have the karma out of it.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I walk out empty.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
see how much of your life

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you're able to be
empty a moment later.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:10%
And how much you
carry stuff over.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The clinging is
where the suffering

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
starts inside yourself around
serving people and helping

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But I realize, as my
work on myself goes on,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.757 align:middle line:84%
that not letting it go
doesn't help that person,

00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't help
me, and it doesn't

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:90%
help the rest of the universe.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I gotta start letting
stuff go faster,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of holding on
is because you feel you didn't

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
do everything you
could, and you're

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:90%
feeling guilty or something.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The game is to do
it as fully as you

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
can do it, and then, let it go.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Not cling to it.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.046 align:middle line:90%
