[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the purpose
of our life on Earth?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a curriculum that the
soul has created in order

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to explore its own
attachments in order

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to awaken out of its illusion
of separateness, which

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:90%
it created as part of its play.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not an era.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:90%
He didn't fall from grace.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not original sin.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It's choice.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I had an interesting discussion
with a Tibetan rascal

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:90%
named Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:90%
I just met him once.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:90%
He called me.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Ram Dass, we
have to accept responsibility.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, what
responsibility, Rinpoche?

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any responsibility.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:90%
God has all the responsibility.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Not my but thy will, oh Lord.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're copping out.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it bugged me because
I didn't understand it.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
I was copping out?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Then he said to me,
you have the choice.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
He said you can be the victim
or you can be the creator.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And the victim is
when you identify

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
with any part of the form
of the manifestation.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:10%
your body, your personality,
your thinking mind--

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:10%
that's all part of
lawful unfolding.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:90%
That's all the victim.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Personality, body,
that's all in law.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:90%
That's all form.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
It's all happening.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all karma unfolding.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Even the experience you
think you're free isn't free.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of
you that has no form.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
That part's the creator.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of
you that is free

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that is creating that
could change anything

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:90%
you want in the universe.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The only funny part
about it is that were

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
you identify with that
part of your being

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
so that you were outside
of it and seeing all,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.102 align:middle line:84%
you'd see why had created it
that way in the first place.

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like in the Bible.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It said, had you but faith,
you could move mountains.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you had the
faith, you'd see

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
why you put the mountain
there in the first place,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
so that from the
soul's point of view,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
it's on a journey,
a creative journey.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And it has created
a set of experiences

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
which are selected by your
body and your personality.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the way, the
selecting mechanism.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the programming
that's gone into it.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And you keep going
through them until you

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
are so clear that even at
the moment of death, instead

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of dying, it's just
another moment.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's special.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.922 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
To go into the
white light of death

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
means that you're
already about 3/4

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of the way turned around
while you're still alive.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
The third Chinese
patriarch-- the great way

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
is not difficult for those
who have no preferences.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
When love and hate
are both absent,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
everything becomes
clear and undisguised.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But make the slightest
distinction and heaven

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and earth are set
infinitely apart.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
