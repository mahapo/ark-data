00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.870 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The first, you have to be
alone by pulling back from

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the game is to be with
people, yet always be alone.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of you take
the feeling of aloneness

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and feel it as pathology?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever thought
of flipping it around,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:90%
just that little flip?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
There's an incredible
lie about the nature

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
of, the potential
of, relationship--

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful quote
from the "I Ching."

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
"The Master said, life
leads the thoughtful person

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
on a path of many windings.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Now the course is checked.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Now it runs straight again.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Here, winged thoughts may
pour freely forth in words,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
but there, the heavy
burden of knowledge

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:90%
must be shut away in silence.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But when two people are at
one in their inmost hearts,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
they shatter even the
strength of iron or of bronze.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And when two people
understand each other

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
in their inmost
hearts, their words

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.205 align:middle line:84%
are sweet and strong, like
the fragrance of orchids."

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
souls hanging out together,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
souls who don't need
anything from each other.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They both are just
watching the unfolding.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The unfolding, on
the ego level, may

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
involve their
interaction, the roles

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:90%
through which they interact.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But the souls are
just sharing a delight

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in the unfolding of the dance.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
At certain stages in the
journey, if you have a choice,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderful to have
other beings around you--

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called a
Satsang or the Sangha,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
a community of other
beings that recognize

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
what the journey
or the curriculum

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:90%
is about that we are born into.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And they help you.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
We help each other.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
precious thing, to have

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
other people you meet and know
that are journeying on the path

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
examine the contracts we

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
make with fellow human
beings, because most

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of the relationships
we enter into

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
are at the ego level,
in which I am somebody

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and I enter into a contract
with you as somebody.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the
nature of the contract

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is I won't bug your somebodiness
if you don't bug mine.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll allow you to
be who you think

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
you are if you'll allow
me to be who I think I am.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that when
you meet with Satsang, you say,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I am trapped in
thinking I'm somebody.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:90%
You are trapped.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Could we help each
other get free?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the peculiar
circumstance is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
when you make that
contract with somebody

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and they come up and
say, you're trapped.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.325 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:90%
You say, you're trapped!

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about it?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody is
trapped, they are trapped,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:90%
meaning they think it's real.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And in their reality,
your criticism

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is seen as a criticism,
not as a helpful hint.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to enter
into the relation of Sangha

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
or Satsang with that
somebody, you've

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
got to realize that truth is
a little scary to live with.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It's much better to live
with truth, however,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
than with the kind of numbing
deception of all of us making

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:90%
believe a reality is real.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
look at the violence

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that consistency has done to
your truth, it's staggering.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
How do you train
your awareness so

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't get
trapped in one plane

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and then cut off your
access to the other planes?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what the issue is.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see how
your definitions of yourself

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
keep trapping you, let alone
the projections that you

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
have to other people, let
alone their projections on you.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So you and I live in a
sea of projective systems,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
some of which are coming out of
our own desires, needs, fears,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
attractions, aversions,
preferences, prejudices,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
opinions, and some of which are
coming from everybody else's.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
See, the predicament
is as you awake

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and you realize you have
been the perpetrator

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of the conspiracy
you got caught in.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
You're it.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
You are it.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:90%
We are it.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:90%
We are the conspiracy.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
question is, when

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
you extricate your
awareness from being

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
part of the conspiracy,
what happens?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're just doing it in
a half-baked way at first,

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
you're busy telling
everybody you've

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:90%
gotten free of the conspiracy.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then they usually
imprison you somewhere,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
because you don't get
free of the conspiracy.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But a mature person
isn't in the conspiracy

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and is not in the
conspiracy even to the point

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:90%
of putting down the conspiracy.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
They're just not
in the conspiracy.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
They are living in a
different universe.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
their being is free

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of that conceptual
homogeneous field.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And that freedom
is what they offer

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to another human
being that frees them,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and to see the maturity
of being able to extricate

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
your awareness from
entrapment in role--

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
without violence-- and
fulfilling the roles

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, but fulfilling
them from a different place.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:90%
