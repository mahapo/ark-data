00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:12.844 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Keep reflecting about who
you are and listening inward

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and inward and inward to find
the deeper truth of your being.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I do this all the time.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I just sit quietly and just
keep listening and going

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
inward and cultivating a
witness of my own life.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
The part of you that watches
your own life unfolding.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
Most of us are so reactive.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You get up in the
morning, smell coffee.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Reaction-- boy, I
need a cup of coffee.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Watch-- my God, it's 8:15.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Reaction.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Reaction-- he cut me off.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Reaction-- oh, my God, look
what's going on in Lebanon.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
You are reactive all day.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There is no reflective
moment in your day.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It's so busy being reactive to
just stuff, and you come back

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and you've just had a
day full of reaction.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And you are like a
mechanical automaton.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And the newspaper knows that if
it runs up a certain headline,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:90%
you'll salute.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ads are
designed for just you.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Certain ads that will awaken
your prurient interests.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Certain ones that will
awaken your guilt.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Certain ones that
will awaken your fear.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.464 align:middle line:90%
And then they'll play upon you.

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
you give a reaction

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:90%
which is habitual and learned.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
It's probably what
your father did to you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and your mother did to
you and all that stuff.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.825 align:middle line:84%
So something comes and
you say, that's nice.

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Something else comes, you
say, oh, that's horrible.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
As you become more
reflective, you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
move from being reactive
to being responsive.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.545 align:middle line:84%
You start to mediate the input
and the reaction with space.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how you have
cultivated that inner space,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
you can go into absolute
emptiness at that moment.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%
You just go quiet.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't think of the
response, you just wait.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
You empty and
trust and go deeper

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to feel an intuitive, a
deeper response to it.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And what comes out
is something that

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
comes from a deeper
part of your truth.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a key issue.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
See, as you cultivate some
kind of reflective space

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, then you are
able to process the universe

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
around you and provide
a response that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
brings the universe back into
harmony, that is a healing

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
response, rather than a reactive
response which perpetuates

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:90%
the suffering of the world.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with the
emptiness of your own mind.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you develop
this reflective

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
quality, this
contemplative quality,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and then you begin
to look at your life

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and you notice that you got
very holy chanting, but then

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
when you got on the subway,
you got very irritated.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.842 align:middle line:84%
And 10,000 times you get
holy and you get irritated,

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you get holy and
you get irritated.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep watching
that, after a while,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
the watcher says, this
is really off the wall.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But then that's just judgment,
and you watch the judgment.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, judging.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
So you just watch it.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Ah, anger, ah, bliss, ah, anger,
ah, emptiness, ah, bliss, ah,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:90%
anger, ah, irritation.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Till pretty soon, as you get on
the bus and you get irritated,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
you're going, ah, irritation.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the witness starts to
dwell with you all the time.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.383 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's my guru.

00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
He's always hanging around
with me saying, well, Ram

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Dass, pretty interesting.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Or he's laughing at
me or he's giggling.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like you start to have a
dialogue between the deepest

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
part of your being and
the part of your being

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
that is the familiar
personality part.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And at first, the deeper
part of your being

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.695 align:middle line:84%
is an imaginary playmate
that you've created.

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Later on, as it
gets stronger, it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
turns out that your personality
was the imaginary playmate.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the transition
we're talking about.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It's bizarre when
it finally happens.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
