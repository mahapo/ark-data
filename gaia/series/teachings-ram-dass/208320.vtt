>> Instead of the term how
can we love ourselves more,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to ask how can
we accept ourselves more?

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
That in the way most of
us have been socialized,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
the way in which a child
gets the initial learning,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the parent
is under pressure

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to socialize the child, to make
the child socially functional.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And in doing that, they--

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, whether
they intend to or not,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
reward and punish the
child for behaviors,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and the result is that
the child develops

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
certain emotional feelings
that certain ways it

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
is in its natural state
are not acceptable.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the result is some
feelings of unworthiness,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
or inadequacy, or something
in most human beings

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
as the result of socialization.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Then you build this
social structure.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And, often, what you end up
with is a personality that's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
constantly looking to the
world and other people,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:90%
do you approve of me?

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you like me?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Am I good enough?

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Am I acceptable to you?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Have I achieved enough?

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And you get an A for
effort, and you feel good.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get the A,
it's not like you feel nothing.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You feel bad.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:10%
And it's as if the baseline
is negative, not zero,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:10%
so that you're constantly using
your life experiences as a way

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:10%
to disprove a basic negative
feeling about yourself.

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

Right behind that is where the
spiritual dimension begins.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's a part that looks at
the universe, and just sees it

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:90%
as it is.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Or we could say,
let's go behind love

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and hate and find a
place where we merely

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge ourselves, where
we just allow our humanity.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And we hear that there
is negativity in us

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and there is inadequacy,
and we allow ourselves.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And the word that
I have come up with

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is the word appreciation,
that we come

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:90%
to just appreciate what is.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%

appreciating what they are,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:90%

And I've worked
on myself, and I'm

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be equanimous,

I'm petulant.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm closed down.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, for a long time, I
get into those states,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and I would feel really
embarrassed because that isn't

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:90%
who Ram Dass is supposed to be.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So I would appear like I was
warm, charming, equanimous,

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, and there was
deviousness and deception

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that's bad
business because that cuts us

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:90%
off from each other.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And I had to risk my truth.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I had to risk being
human with other people

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and realize that what we
offer each other is our truth,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and our truth includes
all of our stuff.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I had to
do was accept my own truth.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.685 align:middle line:84%
I had to allow myself
to be a human being.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I had always assumed the way to
God was to deny your humanity

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and embrace your divinity.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that the way to truth

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
might be through acknowledging
the fullness of where

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I found myself to be, which was
my humanity and my divinity.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:10%
And not wallow in it, but
acknowledge it, and allow it.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:10%
And not reverence it, or
judge it, just appreciate it,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.537 align:middle line:10%
just allow it,
allow my humanity.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what I found was
that, as I started

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to allow myself to be human
more, just allowed what I am,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:90%
things fell away more quickly.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I was
locked into a model which

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
was based on that negativity,
that dislike of myself.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And once I just allowed that I
am human with all the foibles,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
things started to flow, and I
could feel change occurring in

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I would start to
experience my own beauty.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And it frightened me because it
was so dissonant and discrepant

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
from the model that I
had cultivated of myself

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
over the years, that I had to do
good in order to be beautiful.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
expand my awareness

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at
the universe as it is

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and see what is called
the horrible beauty of it,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:90%
the horrible beauty of it.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's horror
and beauty in all of it

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because there's
decay in all of it.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're all decaying.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look at my
hand, and it's decaying.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful and
horrible at the same moment,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and I just live with that.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I start
to see the beauty in it.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%

about appreciating

what is, not loving yourself as
opposed to not liking yourself,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.150 align:middle line:90%
but allowing yourself.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
