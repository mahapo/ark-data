00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, I understand
evil as that which increases

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
illusion, or paranoia, or
separateness, or separates,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
or increases the multiplicity.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can really redefine
most of your evil terms,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and they work in
that definition.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Good is that which
unifies, awakens,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
brings to consciousness, and
relieves human suffering, which

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%
is the same thing.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I also see that the game
is designed perfectly

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and that at the level where
good exists, so does evil.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And this polarity
reinforces itself in a way.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And it exists at a plane
where polarities are.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that you
can look at the act

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
itself and then impose
that statement good or evil

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
depending on its
function or its effect.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And you learn more
and more that acts

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
per se and neither good
or evil, but rather

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the attachments
of the people that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
are performing the
acts that determine

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.598 align:middle line:90%
whether they're good or evil.

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not the people
that are good or evil,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it's the attachments
that are good or evil.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And behind every
evil act is another

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.927 align:middle line:84%
being just like you
and I. It's just

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
a being who's caught
in a karma that's

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
leading them to perform
out of their attachments

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
an act which has evil
consequences, which

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
is increasing illusion.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
As far as what do
you do about it,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
you reward and
punish good and evil.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You recognize both good and evil
as existing in the universe.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But as you become more
conscious, less and less

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
are you able to do things which
would be defined as evil, not

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
because you think you
shouldn't do them,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because you're afraid of
somebody striking you dead,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
but just because you can't do
them because it's too absurd.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean if I think you and I
are us, instead of you are him

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
or them, how can
I steal from you?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't steal from us?

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I may steal from them, but I'm
not going to steal from us.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.102 align:middle line:84%
And the predicament is that with
increasing consciousness, more

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and more of the time
you're living at the plane

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
where you see us beings
hanging out on this Earth,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
on this world, you know
this little round sphere.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And those things which limit
human freedom and increase

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
illusion, you work
to get rid of.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.923 align:middle line:84%
And I think, ultimately,
that's the way

00:02:22.923 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:90%
you deal with good and evil.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
You do it because that's
your incarnation to do it.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
At the same moment,
recognizing that all

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:90%
that exists functionally.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Suffering exists.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Evil exists.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Wars exist,
pestilence, starving.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
You work full time to end them
all at the same moment you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
know that's why they're
there because they're

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be there.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
paradoxes that people

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:90%
have the hardest time with--

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
seeing that it's all perfect
and then understanding

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:90%
social responsibility.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
ability, the wisdom,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to live with
two levels of consciousness

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
To work full time knowing that
it's perfect when you began

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:90%
and perfect when you ended.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And that your working full
time was perfect, too.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.537 align:middle line:84%
In "The Book of
Tokens," it says if you

00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
know not that the
prince of darkness

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is but the other face of the
king of light, you know not me.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's obvious
there's only one.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And all law comes
out of that one.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And the two comes
out of the one.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And because two
comes out of one,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
good and evil, or
dark and light,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
or the prince of darkness,
it all comes out of the one.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And the one is the law.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the law.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:10%
That's the first commandment--
thou shalt only love the one.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The little bit I've been
able to grasp or feel

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the law has
unfolded in its exquisiteness.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And it boggles, of
course, the mind,

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is merely a
little subproduct of this law.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And the law isn't logical.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The law is full of
paradoxes, because it's quote

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:90%
"the natural law" or the Tao.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense,
it's all perfect.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all lawful.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening just
according to plan, including

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
what we have to do about it.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
