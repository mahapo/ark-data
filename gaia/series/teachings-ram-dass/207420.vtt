00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:12.948 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The moments you tasted
freedom seem like dreams.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
At first, you go under,
and it seems so real again.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And you forget you ever
knew that it wasn't real.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And then as time
goes on, it gets

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
so that you're more
comfortable remaining

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
in a more spacious way of
being in the universe that

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
allows more planes of reality
to simultaneously exist.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:90%
You arrive.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You're so rooted in
the quality of being

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:84%
in just presence, that
as your awareness starts

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to be drawn out into
phenomena and you start

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
to grab the thickness of
coming into that density

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of relationship
with form and being

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in a finite form,
somebody doing something,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
wanting something, thinking
something, planning

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
something, or
remembering something,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that thickness
itself awakens you.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you dive
from air into water,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and as the thickness
of the water,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
you feel that resistance.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It awakens you.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.325 align:middle line:90%
And you come back up.

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It's what the beads do.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
You're Ramming your
way along so spacious,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and then another
car cuts you off,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and you are full of
righteous indignation.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And slowly the method
works, and you come back

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
into wow, that was
like a summer storm.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Boy, didn't that
anger seem real?

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just hard to conceive
how in the midst of what

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is, the suffering, the pain,
the hope and the hopelessness,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
the uncertainty, the decay, the
corruption, the regeneration,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
in the thickness of all
of it, what one can be,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
not rejecting
anything, embracing it

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
all into a spacious
presence in which there

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
is delight in the universe
and a quality of rootedness

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
or quietness and an
embracing of everything

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:84%
as one thing, that
out of that comes

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:90%
the compassionate next moment.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Out of it arises an action.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are
afraid that if we get

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
too free of our
indignation or our upset

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
about the condition
of things, we

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
won't do what's
necessary to right it.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's another place
to play from and let

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
it come to pass that the
forgetting is the remembering.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:18.048 align:middle line:90%
