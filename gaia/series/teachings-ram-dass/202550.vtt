00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> What humor does is it
cuts through perspectives.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.465 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You take any issue, and then
you look at it with humor,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and what you do is you
shift planes of reality.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what humor is.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Humor is shifting perspective.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And when it's done in a
certain way, you laugh.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It takes something that's
characterized a certain way,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and characterized a
slightly different way,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:90%
and then it becomes funny.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
There can be humor that
is very caustic humor,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
but the compassionate
humor is humor

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that keeps chiding
humanity for its foibles

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
but not in a judgemental
sense, in a kind

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
of a delightful,
playful, warm sense.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very liberating
to people to learn

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:90%
to take themselves lightly.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to
learn that consciousness

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to keep
an equanimity that

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
allows you to deal
with heavy issues

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:90%
responsibly with lightness.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The word "dance" in
Sanskrit is called

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
"lila," the play, the
dance, or the play of life.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Dance, play, game.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean it's trivial.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It means it has form
and it's a like quality.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it can be looked at from
an inner place of equanimity.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I always keep looking
at people who have so

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:90%
invested in their melodrama.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your
own melodrama--

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
will I, won't I; can I, can't I;
should I, shouldn't I; did she,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:90%
did he--

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gosh, I promise
you you're all going to die.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
They'll probably be
lots of suffering.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody you know
is going to die.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
built into the system.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
What are you getting
so upset about?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you're
surprised by it all,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
like you didn't expect any
of that was going to happen.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:10%
But it all doesn't happen
to everybody always.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And could you imagine getting
to a point where you could allow

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that possibility,
where you could still

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
feel the qualities of your
heart and at the same moment

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
realize, ah, that's the
process of life-- ah

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:90%
life, ah death, ahh.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do it about
yourself, that's when it's fun.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to do it
about other people.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, are you
caught in your drama.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you see how poignant
it is that a person gets trapped

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
in a storyline, in a model,
like, I'm growing old,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting how you
get into a storyline--

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:90%
like, I just lost all my money.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how the mind grabs,
makes it real, and then it all

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
becomes terribly serious?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
You and I are so much more
profound than any finite story.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to
describe this moment,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
there are no words, no matter
how poetic an individual is,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:90%
that could describe this moment.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It is so much richer
than any of the words.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's far out when you
meet a being who is free,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and you look in their eyes,
and you see behind the game.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And the both of you
delight in the play.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
play in the forms.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:90%
You actually play.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, life becomes a
little bit like Monopoly.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But at the same moment,
there is delight

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because we are all at play
in this game of life--

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and how far most people get
from ever enjoying the play.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at yourself, how rarely you
come up for air, how rarely you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
come out of the melodrama.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Up into the clarity that's
just above the clouds that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see,
oh, here I am in this.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Here I am in that.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's extraordinarily
interesting

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
to keep working on
yourself and find

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:84%
ways to spend more and more
of your time free of drama

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
so that when somebody
else comes towards you,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any moral right
to pull them out of their drama

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:90%
if they don't want to come.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is be
an environment for them

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
where if they would like
come up for air, they can.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell them they
should come up for air.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.833 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have
any right to do that.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't know why
they're caught.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But I find myself more
and more giggling inside,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
just this little
giggle at delight

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
about the beauty of form,
and the play of form,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.535 align:middle line:84%
and the way in which
the mind plays with it

00:04:53.535 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and keeps getting caught.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:90%
