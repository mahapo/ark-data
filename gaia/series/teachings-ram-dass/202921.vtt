00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:11.856 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The world is going
to get more and more

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:90%
unstable in world level stuff--

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
economically, politically,
socially, ecologically.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And what this is about
is seeing the possibility

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that one can ride
the waves of change

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:90%
without being wiped out by them.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in an
earthquake recently,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
which in San Francisco,
that's not unusual,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and things were
flying off the shelf

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and doors were flying open.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know whether
the plan would open up

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and me and the house and
all of it would be a memory.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.466 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
ahh, ahh, ahh, so here we go.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's the girl
in the village that

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
has a love affair
with the fisherman

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and she becomes pregnant
and she doesn't want

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
to admit it was a fisherman.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So she says it was the
monk up in the monastery.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So when the baby's born,
they take-- the villagers

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
take the baby to the monastery,
and they knock at the gate.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the monk opens the gate,
and they say here's a baby.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
You are the sire of it.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
You raise it.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And the monk said, ahh, so.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And he took the baby
and closed the gate.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Some years later,
the girl was dying,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't want to
die without confessing

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.414 align:middle line:90%
that it was not the monk.

00:01:57.414 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:10%
It was the fishermen, and
the townspeople really

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:10%
realized they had
made a mistake.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And so they went up, and
they knocked at the gate.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.875 align:middle line:84%
And the gate was opened,
and there stood the monk

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
with the child, who
was now nine years old.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And the people said we
really made a mistake,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and it is not your
responsibility

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
to raise the child.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And now we will be happy
to take care of the child.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And the monk said, ahh, so.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you, if you're
looking for a mantra,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:90%
try that one.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Ahh, so.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Ahh, so.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Your check just
bounced, ahh, so.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.792 align:middle line:84%
Transmission fell
out of your car.

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Ahh, so.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Try the little ones first.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Before you get to, ahh, dying
of a terrible disease, ahh, so.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
See you don't laugh, do you?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Got you where you live see.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Ahh so.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
