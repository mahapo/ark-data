>> Grief is the realization
of the loss of a dream.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:84%
If you have a relationship
with somebody,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
you build an expectation
and a model of reality

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:90%
with your mind.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
that is torn away,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
when that person dies or leaves
you or something happens,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:84%
the breaking of that expectation
takes away your security.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's fear, but also, there
is incredible feeling of loss,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
of sadness, of
feeling incomplete

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
because you built a sense
of your completeness

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:90%
around living within your dream.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And when the dream
collapses, it's

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
as if your whole
identity has died.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a mini death involved,
because we know ourselves

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
in part through our
relationships with all

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
the people around us.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like when my father
died last September,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I went around saying to
everybody, now I'm an orphan.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But I saw that something
very profound changed in me.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
That up until then,
even though dad was 90

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and I was definitely out on
my own for many, many years,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
there was a way in
which my identity

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of elder and child,
and something changed.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a loss
of the security that

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
came from being identified
as always having somebody

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that was my elder
and that was there

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to finally protect me or
take care of me or something.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And grief is the mind's attempt
to deal with the breakdown

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:90%
of expectation.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And what you do
to deal with grief

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
is that, at first, you
grab states of mind

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to make it go
away or to counteract

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:90%
sadness, depression, crying.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the tricky or the art
is not to grab prematurely

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
to try to make it go away.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people who
break off in a relationship

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and then start to grieve over
the loss of relationship,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:84%
react to their grieving by
grabbing a new relationship.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
the new relationship

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
on the sand of the
grieving of the old one.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't given it the
space to run its course through

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
to come out the other end.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm inclined always to
push people back into grief,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
rather than to bring them out.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But not have any model about
how people should grieve.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you've
got to show emotion.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think there
is a timing, there

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is a healing
process that goes on

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
as you start to exist
after the dream has died.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:10%
And then after a
while, there's kind

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:10%
of a natural way in which the
raw ends kind of heal a bit,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:10%
and you start to find new
ways of being in the universe.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's just very gentle.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And up until that time,
it's like a roller coaster.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.267 align:middle line:90%
A person gets very sad.

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:33.725 align:middle line:84%
And then they seem
to be all better

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.017 align:middle line:84%
and everybody says, oh, you've
dealt with it very well.

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And you come up and
you're all smiley.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
it hits you again.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And it can hit you with
seeing somebody's shoes

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
or their old biscuit
box or whatever.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, suddenly it
awakens it again.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Subtle thing about
grief is where

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
people feel that
if I stop grieving,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I am betraying the
person or the thing that

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
left, because I'm forgetting.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I must remember, or
else I wasn't a true lover.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary
thing about it is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that as you quiet down from
the active process of grieving,

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
you quiet down and
you listen and you

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
begin to appreciate that
the way in which you

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
are with another person
in love exists independent

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of coming and going,
even independent of death

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.511 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things.

Sri Ramana Maharshi
the saint said

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
when he was dying of cancer--

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and everybody said to
him, Bhagwan, Bhagwan,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.572 align:middle line:90%
don't leave us, don't leave us.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't be silly.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.902 align:middle line:90%
Where could I go?

00:04:44.902 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just
dropping the body.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so you realize
that the grieving

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
is part of the dramatic
storyline of your separateness.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
grieve for something

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.897 align:middle line:90%
that didn't go anywhere.

00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
even if you break off

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
with a lover and
there's acrimony,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that
there was even

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
a moment of true
love between the two

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
of you, of true transcendent
oneness, that's there,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that thing has no time and
space connected with it.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We keep reducing relationships
into time and space.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Like if you love me, you'd
spend more time with me.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't leave me.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
profound to me now.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And that it has
tempered my life a lot,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because I now am not willing to
spend as much time with people

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:84%
as I used to, to reassure
them that the love is there.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I see it as their
needfulness constantly.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you love me?

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
How much time will
you spend with me?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Will you do this with me?

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Will you do that?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Can I have more of you?

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they
can't get inside behind

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to the place where, where
we go for one another?

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And I find it
extremely interesting

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to love people more and more
and awaken in them the feelings

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of love and then watch their
minds take that and turn it

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
into something
that fear touches,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
so that then they want to grab
it and collect it and keep

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
testing it and
being sure about it.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.138 align:middle line:84%
And when you want to say,
it's here, it's here.

00:06:15.138 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to
see each other again,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's still here.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one
to ask of people.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
