00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In the culture, you
can feel a certain fear.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And that fear leads people
to take certain actions.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:84%
It leads them in part to become
more hedonistic, like it's all

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:90%
going to go up anyway.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to get what
I can while I can get it.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It leads people
to get very rigid

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in trying to hold on to their
little piece of the rock,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
getting much more caught
in the polarity, say,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of good and evil,
of if I am good

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and if I create these boundaries
and if I protect them,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
then somehow all this will be
all right, even though there

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
is chaos right outside my
door, right where I am,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I will be safe if
I'm good enough

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:90%
and if I represent those forces.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And the evil they see as
external to themselves.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And part of what we're
doing collaboratively

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
is exploring what
has happened to us

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and who we are in this
melodramatic panoply of events,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
what has all of our work on
our consciousness been about,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and what are the relationships
of worldly power to what

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
might be called spiritual power,
and what has happened to get us

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:90%
to this particular moment?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:10%
And is this moment
any more dramatic

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:10%
than the plague's Middle Ages?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:10%
Has technology led
us into a cul-de-sac

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.985 align:middle line:10%
or is technology the
vehicle for our liberation?

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:10%
Is technology
something to be feared?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the stepchild of
our intellect, that we merely

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
must know how to
use it as a servant,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
and not be master plan?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And that if you look at
the world at this moment,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
it appears that even
though there is more

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
juice in paranoia, and
negativity in television,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and the media have changed
the meaning of time and space,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
it's changed the
nature of the reality,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
our collective reality;
transportation the mobility

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that we can jump in cars
and-- or plans and ships,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and go be here and there.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I can have lived in
Europe, and in Japan,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%
and in Australia, and Mexico.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And I think nothing of it.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just part of
my zeitgeist, my worldview.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And that when I
lived in cultures

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely
different from my own,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
it's changed the ethnocentricity
of my perceptions.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's changed and the way
in which I view the world.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, living up in a
little village in India,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
where I lived with people
who have one suit of clothes,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and who make maybe a
dollar a day, and eat

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
the same food each
day, simple foods that

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:90%
are indigenous to the area.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the villages, very
often the electricity

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
it either doesn't
exist or is out.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And there there's no television
and the radio crackles.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a waste if
you try to listen.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And people don't live as
old as they live here,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:90%
except for a few.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:90%
There's more infant mortality.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when I am
with those people

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I feel that in
that little village

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
there is more contentment,
more harmonious

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
being with the
universe, more presence

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
than I feel among my affluent
colleagues and brothers

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
and sisters in the West.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've had that
direct experience.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And how does that
temper the values

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that I grew up with that
said more is better?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I was led to believe that
if I had more, and more,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and more largesse,
worldly largesse, somehow

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:90%
I would be happier.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And part of that transition
is that in the television,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
we can look at our hero
figures of this culture, all

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of our mythic
people who made it,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:84%
who got what the
society had to offer.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Even with all the
pancake makeup,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:90%
the television doesn't--

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't hide it all.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
You can almost feel a palpable
quality of suffering, fear

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.379 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:84%
All of these things, from
the scenario of the New Age,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as what is burning
out a certain set of values,

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and attitudes, and
perceptions on our part,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that are making us
ripe for the rebirth.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And that that
rebirth of definition

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of ourself, of what we're
doing in the universe,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that rebirth is what changes
the whole dance around.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And that all of the stuff
that is so scary to us

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
is merely a creation of
mind because obviously this

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:90%
is a conspiracy of mind.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And we are just dwelling
in a state of mind.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And that mind manifests in
this action or that action.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:90%
