00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just on
a train in India,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was traveling
with a young friend.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was his
first time in India,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and he was very overwhelmed
by beggars in need.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.565 align:middle line:90%
He'd come from the America.

00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
He'd never been
out of California.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So there was one point
we got on the train,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and I bought 12 tangerines.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
They were very
expensive tangerines.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They cost a rupee apiece, which
in India is a lot of money.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
We were traveling by
a first-class train--

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
because we were
both kind of sick,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
we were allowing
ourselves that luxury--

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:84%
which is a compartment
with four people in it.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
There was an Indian
lawyer, very successful.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a man from New
York City who was on a trip

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
around the world he had given
himself for his 70th birthday.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And there were the two of us,
and there were the oranges.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped at a station, and
somebody came up to the window

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and begged.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And my friend who was
sitting next to the window

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
took a tangerine and
handed it to the person.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And then another beggar
saw that the first beggar

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
got a tangerine and came
over, and another tangerine

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
disappeared.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Until pretty soon, hands were
grabbing into the window,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and tangerine
after tangerine was

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
disappearing until all
the tangerines were gone.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Indian man was
saying, that's not the way.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way at all.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
That is not proper.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And the older American man
was saying, disgraceful.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
My young friend turned to
the people and he said,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
those people wanted
those tangerines.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I think I have a right
to give those tangerines

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
without your judgment.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you that from
my point of view, the serving

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and the relieving of
suffering directly

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
from one human being to
another is of incredible value

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:90%
for everyone involved.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it get too abstract.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to write checks,
but it's also important

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that when the person down
the street trips and falls,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
you can reach over
and help them up.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Keep it very human.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:90%
That's important in service.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can also do
the big abstract things

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:90%
but keep it very, very human.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
