00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the other day I
was walking at my home

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
in California, and I looked over
the fence and there were these

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.220 align:middle line:90%
exquisite--

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the whole fence was covered with
these beautiful blue flowers.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was in ecstasy.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They were radiantly
bright and blue.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have my glasses on.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what kind
of flowers they were,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
but they were just
absolutely beautiful.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:90%
And I was just in delight.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And I went to my neighbor with--

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:10%
on whose estate I
live, and I said,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:10%
there are just these absolutely
beautiful blue flowers.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.792 align:middle line:84%
And then later in
the afternoon, we

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
started to go outside
for something else.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, let me show
you these blue flowers.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I came up and there weren't
any blue flowers, because they

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:90%
were morning glories.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And those of you that
know about morning glories

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
know that they're only
glorious in the morning.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And at first I felt confused,
and angry, and upset,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and embarrassed, and everything.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, I could have sworn
there were blue flowers here.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, You
mean the morning glories?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the word
morning glory went in,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, ah, that's
what morning glory means.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.465 align:middle line:90%
Ah, what do you know?

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:35.265 align:middle line:90%
And I relaxed.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Faith is understanding that
they are morning glories.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Faith is understanding
that as long as there

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
are any clingings in you
at all, that you are going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to lose the spiritual
material aspects

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual experience,
which is understanding,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
bliss, rapture,
feeling of intimacy.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is an experience
connected with spirituality

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%
is going to come and go.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
To the extent that you
have based your faith

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
on experience--

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:90%
this is a really far out edge--

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
you are bound to have a hard
road, because you're going

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:90%
to constantly be flickering.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be afraid of
the shifts of your experience.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
The minute you recognize
that faith concerns something

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that lies behind experience,
that is just being,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
not the experience of
being, but just being.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
That when it turns dull
and it all seems empty

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and there's nobody around,
it's much more of awesome.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it opens
up and it's awesome.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.965 align:middle line:84%
And you don't demand of yourself
that you always be wise,

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that you always be
clear, and you always

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're
connected to God.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
That you realize that all these
experiences are just the way

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
the mind is playing in
the universe of form.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And that when you're feeling
that intimacy, and that warmth,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and that devotional,
delicious quality,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
if you will go in deeper to
find the place behind all

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, then you will
find that when you're

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in the depressed, cut off, empty
thing, you can sit with that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:90%
and find the place to rest.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not an experience
of negative or positive.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just mm.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty soon, the mm
and the mm are the same mm.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the ah and the
ugh are just little things.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
They're the morning glories
opening and closing.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Remember the story of
the man, the farmer?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And one day his horse ran away.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And his neighbor said to
him, oh, that's too bad.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And the farmer said, who knows?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And the next day
the horse came back,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and it had attracted
a wild horse.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So now he had two horses.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbor came
and said, How wonderful!

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:90%
And the farmer said, who knows?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, his young son
decided to ride the wild horse.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was riding the wild
horse, and he fell off

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and he broke his leg.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbor came
and said, that's too bad.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
And he said, who knows?

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
At the time there was a war,
and the army came through,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
conscripting young men.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't take his son,
because he had a broken leg.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbors
said, how fortunate.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And he said, who knows?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the place, the
who knows, who knows.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And usually when you
have gotten attached

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual, material
experiences of bliss,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and of intimacy, and of
aliveness of spirit, when

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
it turns dead, and cold, and
nothing, you get so freaked,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and so reactive, and
feeling like you fell out

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of grace that you are then
dealing with all your reactions

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to it, not with
the thing itself,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
just with the reactions to it.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:90%
With, oh, I wasn't worthy.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't deserve it.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see, God figured me out.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fraud, you know?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And now because I've gone in
and out of it so many times,

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:90%
now my faith is strong.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Not my faith that I
will feel the experience

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
of being close to God, but
just the faith of that it is.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
