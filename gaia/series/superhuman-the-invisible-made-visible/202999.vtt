We exist as physical beings

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
while our mind is in constant
communication with unseen

forces in unknown worlds.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%

and interact?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It seems that our
consciousness may be entangled

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
with the physical
world and in many ways.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
If that is the case,
then there must

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
be physiological
effects we can detect

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%

of Noetic Sciences.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
He agreed to run an experiment
with my friend, Rod,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
that would demonstrate
the physiological effect

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:90%
of intuitive abilities.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we're going to show
you is a series of pictures,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
some of which will be emotional
and some of which will be quite

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:90%
calm.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is
look at the pictures,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because we have,
in front of you,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
an eye tracking system
that will measure

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the pupil size of your eyes.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The reason we use pupil
size is because it reflects

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
your emotional processing.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
What we're interested
in this is not

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
how you respond when you're
looking at the picture,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
but whether you respond before
the picture actually shows up.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It could explain many phenomena
that we think of as psychic,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because we're
getting information

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
about something which has not
actually even occurred yet.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:10%
In this case, we're
using pictures,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:10%
because they're fun
to look at, and we

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:10%
can take advantage of the
emotional response in the eye.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:10%
But it seems to work
on any sensory level.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So the hypothesis here is
that my higher consciousness,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:10%
which isn't bound by
third dimensional reality,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:10%
senses what's coming.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
My eyes dilate.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether it's other
dimensional or higher self

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:90%
or other self, we don't know.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to think of
it only, at this point,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
in terms of unconsciously
what is happening,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and unconscious is
reflected in physiology.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's start
it up, and it's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
going to go all by
itself now, and we'll

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:90%
let you do it by yourself.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.242 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:21.242 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:10%
>> So to do the analysis, now,
what we're interested in is,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:10%
what is the pupil doing before
the emotional or calm picture

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:10%
shows up?

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:10%
The probability of
the pupil beforehand

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:10%
is actually a little bit
bigger than the probability

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:10%
for the emotional or
for the calm picture.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
The pupil can't move that much.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Half a millimeter is
actually quite a lot,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and this was about maybe a
half a second before the image

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
actually showed up.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:90%

>> If we are able to measure
the physiological effects

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness on the body,
then we could also potentially

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
influence a biological system,
water, or even our own DNA.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:10%
For the past 25
years, Dr. Glen Rein

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:10%
has pursued a career in
DNA research, neuroscience,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:10%
and quantum biology at
prestigious institutions,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:10%
such as Harvard and
Stanford Medical Schools.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I thought that we
should talk about pH,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of people
understand that pH--

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:10%
higher pH in water
is better for health,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:10%
and so I thought this
experiment may be very useful.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The body needs to be at a
very central pH, around 7.2,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and if it's too high or too
low, we get into trouble.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you explain how
this instrument works?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> PH is the measure of
the amount of hydrogen

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.073 align:middle line:84%
And there's a special probe
that's sensitive to hydrogen,

00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and then they convert
it to electrical signal,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and you get a number.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
On five separate occasions,
I measured the pH

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
over a course of an hour,
and it doesn't change more

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
than the very last segment.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.670 align:middle line:84%
That's 1/100 of a
unit of pH unit.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
If you can change
1/10 of a unit,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that would be a very
profound change.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So the idea is for me to
affect the water, and then--

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:90%
either up or down.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.985 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we will
get an instant reading.

00:07:08.985 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Which we will
see it in real time.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right back.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Let me see what I can do.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> My intent was to lower
the pH in the water.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I visualized that my
mind was connected

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
to the hydrogen
molecules in the water

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.445 align:middle line:90%
and getting them to multiply.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
More hydrogen molecules
means a lower pH.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So we started at 7.57,
and I dropped it to 7.47.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> 7.47-- and
that's a whole unit.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a large effect.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you can change
this particular parameter,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the acid-alkaline
balance in water,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
implies that you could
change it in the body.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The body has this
amazing intelligence.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It knows what it needs.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you can
create an environment

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
with your consciousness and
your thoughts and your intention

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that pH can change at
all would allow the body

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to change the pH in the
appropriate direction

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that it needs.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The dogma is that you can't
change your body chemistry

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
by thinking about it,
but the implication

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the intention and
the imagery that you use

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
can be used to change
your own internal pH.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And yes, just let your
body do what it knows

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is the optimal direction
and magnitude for change.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's do another experiment,
which is different from the pH

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:90%
meter.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I have a special device here.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It's called potentiostat.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
This allows me to take a measure
of the conductivity of DNA.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So DNA is very sensitive
to human consciousness,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:90%
from my own previous research.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The experiment to see is if you
can influence the conductivity.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, first sample of
DNA, and now we're

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
going to do three
controls in a row.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, I'm going to
write "control" here.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> This is going to be--

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Control 1.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Control 1.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
actually doing now is

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:84%
we're calculating the
experimental error

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
by looking at what
happens to the DNA

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:90%
when there's no intervention.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
doing the three controls

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.028 align:middle line:90%
at three different times.

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to do it
a fourth time in a row,

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and except you're
going to intervene.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So we know what the variation
will be and the experimental

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:84%
error, as I was saying
before, will be if there's no

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:90%
intervention.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:90%

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:00.528 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Control number three--

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> 12.46, so the
average is 12.9.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> 12.9 kiloohms.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you now are able
to, in your consciousness,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
resonate with this and either
get it to go up or down,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
then we'll be able
to measure it.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My intent was to increase
the electrical conductivity,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
so I visualized that my mind was
producing an electrical current

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:90%
in the DNA at a very high speed.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I think I did it.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it
responded very quickly.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:90%
That's why I kind of stopped.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so here is the magic
number we're looking for.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's way, way down to 6.5.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I felt like it
responded very quickly,

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
and it was--

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like I zapped
it or something.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's what I'm saying.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
6.5 is-- well, let's do
it a couple of times.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same sample.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.515 align:middle line:90%
>> 6.5 kiloohms.

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:07.315 align:middle line:90%
>> 5-0.

00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:90%
5-0, right.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so here's number two,
and this one is measuring it

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:90%
at 6.37.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that there's such
a huge difference so quickly,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like there's
no question that something

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Am I correct to say that?

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, right?

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%
How could it jump from 12 to 6?

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, and this one is now--

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> This is, again--

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Now we're reading 6.2.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a large, robust effect
demonstrating that at least

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:10%
your consciousness is able
to resonate with and change

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:10%
the electrical
properties of DNA.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And the implication
for the audience

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is that if you can do
it, then we could do it

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and with our own intention.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%
We can heal our own bodies.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that you're
just projecting energy,

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and whether you project
it into a test tube

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
or whether you project
it into your own body

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
or whether you project
it into my body,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
it's the same phenomena.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
target receiving the energy.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I've actually done
comparisons using DNA

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
with different machines.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Certain machines were
better than others,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
but always, the
human consciousness

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:84%
was better at resonating
with and changing DNA.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:10%
>> When you say, "better at
resonating," is it faster,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:10%
more efficient, more powerful?

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> All of the above.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Faster, for sure.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:10%
From my own research,
I can certainly

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:10%
say that an electromagnetic
field can affect water

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:10%
and takes at least 12
hours to do the same effect

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:10%
that you did in 12 seconds.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So if nothing else,
human consciousness

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
is much more efficient.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.592 align:middle line:84%
It's empowering,
as humans, to know

00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that we can heal
ourselves, that we don't

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
have to rely on a
drug, and we don't

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:90%
have to rely on a machine.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's considered
legitimate science--

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the ability of the mind
to influence the body.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:10%
They've discovered that
the more the DNA is

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:10%
capable of conducting
electricity,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:10%
the faster and stronger is
its ability to self-heal.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've just
demonstrated that my intent

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
or my consciousness literally
changed the conductivity,

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
therefore, affected the
molecular functioning of this

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
biological system,
the water or the DNA.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you're changing
the molecular level,

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
but you're also changing
the quantum level,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:90%
which underlies everything.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you change
the atomic level.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you change the
molecular level,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you change
the structural level.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter whether
our physical bodies are

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
made of physical matter
or electromagnetic energy

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
or quantum energy, because with
consciousness, which underlies

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
all of those
fundamental energies,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
you can change them all,
because it is at the heart

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and source of all these
qualities, which make up

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
the human body.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:90%

>> Our consciousness
communicates with our physical

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:84%
body, but our cells also have
a way of communicating with us

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
on many levels and
in different ways.

Dr. Jim Gimzewski, a fellow
of the Royal Science Society,

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and distinguished biochemistry
professor at UCLA,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
shared with us his
revolutionary work

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
sonocytology, which

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
detects the vibrations coming
out of the human cells.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Originally, I was
an IBM in Zurich,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:10%
Switzerland in the
research laboratory,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:10%
and we were developing a
new type of microscope.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The first experiment
we wanted to do,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:90%
actually, was on stem cells.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It was then 9/11 at that
time, and so we couldn't

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:90%
get those samples from Italy.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And so my graduate
student suggested

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
we look at something
else, and we

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
decided we'd look at
yeast, because yeast

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
is very simple to work on.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
using this technique

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
called atomic force microscopy--

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
it's basically like a little
finger that can feel things.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.175 align:middle line:84%
We started to notice a fairly
high frequency vibration.

00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:28.356 align:middle line:90%
[BEEPING]

00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
thought it was some kind

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:90%
of noise in the system.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So we kept doing
different experiments

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and established it was a real
effect of the live yeast cell.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The technology we used employs
something called a cantilever.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like a small flat lever.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that
lever, there's a tiny tip.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring that tip in
contact with the yeast sell,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
the tiniest motion, even on
a level of subatomic motion,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:90%
is picked up by the cantilever.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
We use a laser beam we shine
off the end of the cantilever,

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and that amplifies
this tiny motion

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:90%
so that we can record it.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's just, for the sake of--

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
argument's sake,
we take one cell.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Inside the human
cells, there will

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
be a lot of mechanical
processes going on--

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:84%
transporting nutrients,
moving things around.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:90%
There will be motion of the DNA.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
can occur, essentially,

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:90%
at different rates.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So the end result is
a complicated motion

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
on a very small scale.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned that the
healthy cell has a continuous

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
harmonious sound, but then the
diseased cell has an erratic

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:90%
sound.

until it stopped.

So if you look at a
dead cell, for instance,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.280 align:middle line:84%
you will effectively hear
something like white noise,

>> Since the cell has its own
cell vibration and resonance,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the organ has its own vibration,
the entire body then has its

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
own vibration.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we are actually

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
an entire instrument, an
organism that is resonating,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, that's how
we are, perhaps, affecting

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:90%
each other?

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I definitely believe that
we are able to influence

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:90%
ourselves, influence our others.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:10%
>> A fascinating observation
comes from our own planet,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.290 align:middle line:10%
the solar system,
and the universe,

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:10%
which also emits sounds similar
to the sounds of the cells

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:10%
inside our own human body.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The thoughts that we have
create sounds in other people.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:10%
In ourselves, it
affects our organs,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and it affects other
people's bodies and organs

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:10%
and creates different
levels of vibrations

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:10%
that will trigger consciousness
affects in another person

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:10%
and can affect their health and
all kinds of things from that.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>> The power of that
unconditional love to fully

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:10%
influence everything
in our existence,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:10%
if we're simply open to it,
if we're resonant with it

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:10%
in our kind of loving
heart consciousness,

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:10%
if we resonate with
that loving force.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:10%
>> I do think that if you're
a good person, you know,

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:10%
and you really just kind of
give all that stuff out there,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:10%
you look at everything
in a positive manner.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:10%
So everything that comes
to you is a positive.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>> I also think it keeps
your body healthier, too.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:10%
You have less stress
when you open yourself up

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:10%
to positive things
rather than dwelling

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:10%
in what's going to go wrong.
