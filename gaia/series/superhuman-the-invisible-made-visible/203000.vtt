>> What makes people
truly fulfilled?

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it love, family,
success, or is it

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
finding out who you really are,
what you are truly made of,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
so you know your purpose here
on Earth and your connection

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:90%

We exist as physical beings
in a physical reality,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
while our mind is in
constant communication

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
with unseen forces
and unknown worlds.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
We are the visible part
of a potentially infinite

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:90%
invisible realm.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
How do the two worlds, mind
and matter, coexist, collide,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.055 align:middle line:90%
and interact?

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
We know our intent, our
thoughts, our emotions

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
affect how we feel, but have
you considered that what you say

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
may also have a direct
and measurable influence

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
on your body?

analyzes your vocal imprint to
identify toxins and pathogens

Don Estes has developed
a new approach

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to this vocal technology
that demonstrates

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
not only the frequency
imprint, but the patterns that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:90%
are present in your voice.

Karina Smirnoff's world is
all about music and sound.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
She's a world renowned
professional dancer

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and choreographer.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
She was particularly
intrigued by the impact

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
sound vibrations
can have on her body

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and her overall well-being.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've always been busy
working and creating my career.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:10%
And I always wanted kids.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:10%
There was never a point in my
life that I didn't want kids,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:10%
but it's also difficult,
because if I have a child, then

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:10%
I have to take time out of
my work and out of my career.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.735 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
introduce you to my friend.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we'll
see what happens.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.818 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just going to
let you discover it.

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You'll see what I mean.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.989 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:53.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
How are you, my dear?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Karina, why don't you
tell us about your life?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my schedule
is really, really busy.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I travel the world
internationally, constantly.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I do 14 to 16-hour
days I always feel

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
like there is never enough time
to do everything that I want.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So what you're actually
going to be doing today is

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:10%
you're going to be doing a new
technology called the Portacle,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:10%
which you express yourself into.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:10%
So we take the voice in.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:10%
We analyze that, and at the same
time that that's happening, now

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm plotting this
pattern on the screen.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people use this technology
as an intention machine,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
an intention
manifestation machine.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to speak my
intentions into it,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and I want that to come true.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have you put that on
and flip it around that way.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk about
something that's really,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:90%
really bothering you right now?

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:10%
>> At this point, the only thing
I'm missing is having my own

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:10%
kids, having a family.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm running out
of time to have a child, where

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:10%
my parents can also get
to enjoy their grandchild,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:10%
where I'm not a mom
who gets to pick up

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:10%
her child from kindergarten,
and they start thinking,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:10%
is that your grandma?

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so Don can show you how
these are real patterns that

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:10%
are inside yourself.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, the first thing I
notice about this is all of her

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
outward radiance has
kind of gone away.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:10%
We see more, again,
of these oval shapes

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:10%
that are vertical ovals, which
means there's a lot of focus

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:10%
on the potential, more
so than the imaginary.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:10%
So on this horizontal
plane, you've

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:10%
got a lot of energy
tied around time.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So Karina, when you look at
this pattern, how do you feel?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> It's busy without structure.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Chaos.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So why don't you switch
to something you really,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
really love, something that's
working in your life that you

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
want more of?

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I do what I love.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
I get to travel the world.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:10%
I love traveling.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:10%
I get to experience different
countries, cultures,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:10%
so I love that, and I
enjoy that tremendously.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:10%
And I'm also doing a lot
of things with the kids.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:10%
I have a big kids program
that is taking off really,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:10%
really fast.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
This is like having
a dream come true.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
In terms of work and
where it's going,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be more
grateful and happier.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we see a lot of
harmony going on in there.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of circles
outside of the center there.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
That really brings your energy
out into the environment.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to have a
tremendous effect on people.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a responsibility
to self as well as to other

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
people to be able to stay
in the right state of mind,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:90%
to stay positive.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your favorite color?

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always loved yellow,
because I find that, like,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.600 align:middle line:90%
it's happy.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:10%
It's a ray of sunlight.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's warm.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%
It's life-bringing.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It's yellow.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.445 align:middle line:90%
Like, yellow is happy.

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:18.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell us about your
least favorite color.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> My least favorite
is dark burgundy,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
like that dull and not even
dark, like dull burgundy.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I find it stale
and flat and old.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> This is interesting.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.433 align:middle line:10%
When she was saying
yellow, I saw yellow.

00:07:40.433 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> You saw more yellow here.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.308 align:middle line:84%
>> And then when she
was saying burgundy,

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
there was more burgundy.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I want to feel happy,
I should wear my yellow.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> She doesn't even
have to wear yellow.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:10%
She could say or think yellow.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.862 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were talking
about earlier is what

00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:90%
you say is what reality is.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the hardest thing
for people to really get.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you very much.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:90%
This was incredible.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
It was very eye-opening.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I learned a lot.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe the experience
today not only enhanced,

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but it kind of proved that
we create our reality.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So if there is
something that we want,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:90%
we need to project it out there.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:90%
We need to manifest it.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to at least
give ourselves

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:90%
the platform to create it.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:84%
There is something
more to a human

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.721 align:middle line:84%
being other than just
the physical being.

00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of
like a fingerprint.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like each one of us has
an individual everything.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We have an individual
fingerprint.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:90%
We have a voice print.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We have brain frequencies
and heartbeats.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Your heart shows how you're
feeling about things.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Your brain shows how you're
thinking about things.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
But your voice does
that immediately.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
When you say it into the
real world, you make it real.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you say it enough,
it will become real.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Reality actually starts
on the other side.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of scientists that
are beginning to see this

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.310 align:middle line:90%
see it as a mirror universe.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Any real thing that's on this
side in the direct space we

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
live in that is not
100% its true self,

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%

you get particle distribution,
two lumps of particles

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:10%
behind a slit, and when
the observer doesn't look,

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:10%
you get a diffraction pattern?

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%

there in their data stream.

Once that's done, it
has to stay there.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:84%

a positive image.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's try something
with a positive.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.398 align:middle line:84%
This is the image that
we're going to be using.

00:18:35.398 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We can teach the computer how
you react to a certain image.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I included this blank
white slide in there

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to be nothingness, unless you're
recalling a specific pattern.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:10%
So let's try to
recall that image.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Put yourself on stage.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:57.827 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.827 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And then think of nothing.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:06.654 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.654 --> 00:19:09.633 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself back on that
stage, and feel the way

00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that you felt when
you were there.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's crazy.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It reminds me of that
expression, when it rains,

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:10%
it pours.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder that when
things are going well,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
they go really, really
well, or vice versa.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:10%
Like, I-- those times when I
booked two national commercials

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:10%
and got a boyfriend
all in one week,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:10%
it's like, well, yeah, I'm
putting something out there.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm fixating on the positive.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes to show
we need to flood our brains

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
with positive images.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
That was so interesting.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, we
have so much power.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to
affect change in our lives,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
so why not choose the positive,
since we have a choice?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Did this help you kind of
see how your mind can go

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.968 align:middle line:90%
either way in a split second?

00:20:10.968 --> 00:20:11.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:11.768 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And how your
brain is registering?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like, when in doubt.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
If you get the choice, which,
of course, we have the choice,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:90%
go to Jamaica.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Our thoughts and emotions
can be perceived as sound

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and images.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Sound can be turned
into an image,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
as in the biological
sonar that is

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
used by several kinds
of animals, whereby

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
the animal emits a
sound that resonates

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and echoes back a visual
description of the environment

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
that they're in.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
In plant life,
studies have shown

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that trees emit a
frequency, and this

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
is how trees can
communicate with other trees

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
about incoming predators
or weather patterns.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
How could there be oneness
with animal life, plant life,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth itself without
a mechanism that allows

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:90%
you to maintain this oneness?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
If plants and animals
can communicate

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
through seemingly
invisible frequencies,

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that humans
could also be doing the same?

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We are surrounded by
this invisible pool

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
of energies and waves.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We know electromagnetic
waves, sound waves exist,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
but we don't see them.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is, how
much of these waves

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
can we actually detect
on this side of the veil?

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.875 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Ex-FBI agent, Ben Hansen,
has been investigating

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and documenting paranormal
anomalies around the world

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:90%
using multiple technologies.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
He volunteered to demonstrate
these technologies to us,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:84%
so I decided to
bring a friend along.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Corey Feldman needs
no introduction.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Child actor, filmmaker,
and musician,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Corey's fascinated by
supernatural phenomena

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to join us for
some interesting experiments.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was working
for the Bureau,

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
they have looked into phenomena,
such as UFOs and cattle

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:90%
mutilations.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:84%
The devices that
I use, conducting

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
kind of our own experiments
into something that's called

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
ITC research.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
heard of that before.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-mm.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's instrumental
transcommunication.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So in about the '70s,
people started experimenting

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and finding out you
could take all sorts

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
of electronic
devices, and voices

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:90%
were showing up on the tapes.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Eh.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:90%
A little skeptical, but.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, and so was I--

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
completely skeptical,
because the prime theory

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of what we call capturing
an EVP, Electronic Voice

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Phenomena, is that we're dealing
with electromagnetic waves.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was that you
can take a device such as this,

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:90%
which is an induction coil.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
This experiment
we're going to do

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
is speak into the
red tape recorder.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Then what we're going to do is
transmit through this induction

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.808 align:middle line:90%
coil to the blue tape recorder.

00:23:14.808 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:90%
The blue is the receiver.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:90%
The red is the transmitter.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Is we're going to
take your voice,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have you make
a message on the red tape

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
recorder.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.333 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first thing
I want you to do--

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
if you could take the battery
out of the blue recorder

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a blue
battery in it, too.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that convenient?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So for quality control,
we'll take the blue recorder,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just set it
over here out of the way.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Now the red recorder, I would
like you to leave a message.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Captain's log, stardate 2018.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
This is Captain Corey of
the USS Red Recorder leaving

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
a message that may be
detected in other universes

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
or dimensions.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So I can see it's there.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
You left a 20-second message.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so it's here.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But just to make sure,
what we're going to do

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to take
what we call an EMF meter,

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic field meter.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we play this back, we
see the needle fluctuating.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The EMF meter is picking
up electromagnetic field

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:90%
from this device.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> His voice is on the recorder,
but what is being picked up

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:90%
here is not the sound.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It's being picked up by
an induction coil, which

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:90%
creates a magnetic field.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just basically magnetic
energy that's traveling.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Magnetic energy, exactly.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So we'll put the meter
aside, and now we

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
have a transmitting coil, which
is broadcasting a message.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you can now put the
battery back into the recorder,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've shown it was not
recording at the same time

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:90%
this was.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way
it picked up on it.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.877 align:middle line:10%
I'm now going to touch
these two coils together.

00:25:05.877 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:10%
You see they're
close, because they've

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.538 align:middle line:10%
got to be close to
each other fields,

00:25:09.538 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:10%
but they're not touching.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Powered on.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So now we have our blue
recorder, which we'll

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:90%
call it the receiving recorder.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Just get a simple
little speaker here so

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that we can hear it better.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:90%
We're going to plug into it.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Fingers crossed-- let's
see if your message is now

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:90%
on the captured recorder.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Captain's log, stardate 2018.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
This is Captain Corey of

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.535 align:middle line:90%

00:25:47.535 --> 00:25:48.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there you go.

00:25:48.452 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you see how clear it was?

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Very clear.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Very clear.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> That was not
done by radio waves.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It was not done acoustically.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We've transferred it seemingly
through some magical energy,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
but science knows as an
electromagnetic field.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So the theory behind this
is it's energy-based.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.023 align:middle line:84%
>> All we have here is a piece
of metal with wire wound around

00:26:13.023 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:90%
inside of it.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
biggest induction coil--

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.818 align:middle line:90%
what's the grand scale?

00:26:17.818 --> 00:26:19.943 align:middle line:84%
What do we have that would
be the biggest induction

00:26:19.943 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:90%
coil that surrounds us all?

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The Earth.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The Earth.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
If it's that, or if it's some
other energy we don't quite

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.590 align:middle line:84%
understand, we're
all connected to it.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You just demonstrated how
sound waves can be transferred

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
from one point to another
without physical contact.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.655 align:middle line:84%
>> I can think of
somebody across the world,

00:26:40.655 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and just by thinking
about them--

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> They'll call you.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> They call you.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do it all the time.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
The reality is we're all
plugged in to the same source.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I completely agree.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We can take this whole concept
of imprinting your residual

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
onto a physical object
visually in a special camera

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So if I could have you both
just have a seat right there.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Just relax.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come over here, and
I have a specialty camera here.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:10%
The average human puts out about
the same amount of heat energy

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.057 align:middle line:10%
as 100-watt light bulb.

00:27:23.057 --> 00:27:24.640 align:middle line:10%
So that's what you're
doing right now,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:10%
both of you just sitting there.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:10%
Energy is, as we know,
a lot of thermodynamics

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:10%
that could be transferred
from one thing to another.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And heat being an energy,
a wave in a sense, you

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:10%
guys are emanating that now, OK?

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And you're interacting
with everything

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:10%
you come in contact with.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So just by sitting
there in those chairs,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.135 align:middle line:90%
you're transferring energy.

00:27:47.135 --> 00:27:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes your masseuse,
they'll, like, do that,

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll just kind
of put their hands above you.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.075 align:middle line:84%
They're not touching
you, but you

00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
can feel the heat radiating
through your body.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You might even feel that
when you meet certain people,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
kind of an energy transfer.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I could have you both
stand up and just go hang out

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
there on that
couch for a second.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, and I'll just
record just so we have enough

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:10%
So before you guys sat down,
I took a video of those

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:10%
chairs you're sitting in with
a thermal camera, which sees

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:10%
into the infrared spectrum.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So it senses heat, not much
of a visible light at all.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see here the
chairs are primarily blue.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Above you, we have
some red heat,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.895 align:middle line:84%
which is actually a heater, a
vent up there that's heating up

00:28:32.895 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:90%
the books on the top shelf.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see it.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Yep, OK.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you sat down, there
you are in full color.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
The darker areas represent
the colder spots,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:84%
so you can see your pants and
the cuffs that are not actually

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.827 align:middle line:90%
touching your pants or darker.

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Shoes are darker.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And your faces
are the brightest,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're the
hottest in frame.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to
show you was the point

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that you guys get up here, so
you get up out of your chairs.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And bam, look at that.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:90%
That is an imprint.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's some serious heat.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Look at mine-- really
bright where my face was.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.702 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see where your hand
was on the left hand, and you,

00:29:16.702 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I think, had an elbow or
something like you were just

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:90%
sitting there.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but it's really from--

00:29:22.813 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:90%
it seems like that's--

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Torso.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's right
where my heart would be.

00:29:25.963 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, the chest seems
to be the brightest.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just the
heat that we feel,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's also an
energy we can see.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We affect everything in the
material world with our energy.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we have good energy, and
we're putting good energy out

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
to the world, then we're going
to get good responses back.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But if we're putting out
negative energy all the time,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
have negative come in

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and infect your life
that way, until you make

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:90%
a conscious effort to stop.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And once you go, I'm going to
believe everything is good,

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
everything is fine, it's all
going to work itself out,

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden, things
start to reverse themselves.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I will never tell somebody
with 100% certainty what I

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
captured on this tape recorder,
on this video is a ghost,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:90%
an alien.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe
in ghosts, mind you.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I never did.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
things that have happened,

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:90%
where it makes you question it.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> All we know is
it's unexplained,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that we can't
see, but it's being perceived.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, technology
is capturing it.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, I believe that
there is much beyond this

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.050 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have many
variations on that,

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:84%
so if we're talking
about the spiritual realm

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
or if we're talking about
the inner dimensional realm,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
or there's a lot of different
kind of understandings

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:90%
of what that means.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We probably occupy the same
physical space, so if we do,

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
but we don't see each
other all the time,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:90%
what would you call that?

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And the dimension is kind of the
only word that comes to mind.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So multiple dimensions-- yes,
I think it's very possible.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that people
said, oh, well, this is god,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I believe is just a limited
capability of understanding

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
What they saw in
miracles and things that

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
happened before them were
unexplainable in any other way

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:90%
other than saying, that's god.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Outside of the physical, I
believe that there is an energy

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe there's
a bigger force at play.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Something's happening
that's bigger than us.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond the body, once we
leave our meat puppet behind,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we go back to our
actual true existence.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> At times, I get frustrated
that I can't see it.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have, like, these
beady Canadian close set eyes

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.063 align:middle line:84%
that I would hope that
are like laser beams

00:31:53.063 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see these things,
I can't, and I-- it really

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.800 align:middle line:90%
frustrates me.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like you pull the
goggles off the virtual

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.192 align:middle line:90%
reality, and you're home again.

00:32:00.192 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you're brought back,
you maybe choose what you want

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Our reality, in essence,
could be different to different

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
people, although I do
think there is one truth.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
science has not

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
caught up to be able to explain
the rules by which it operates.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:90%
