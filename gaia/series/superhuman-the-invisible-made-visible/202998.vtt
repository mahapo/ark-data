truly fulfilled?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it love, family, success,
or is it finding out

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:90%
who you really are--

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:90%
what you are truly made of--

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
so you know your purpose here
on Earth and your connection

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We exist as physical beings
in a physical reality,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
while our mind is in
constant communication

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
with unseen forces
and unknown worlds.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
We are the visible part
of a potentially infinite

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:90%
invisible realm.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:90%
How do the two worlds--

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:84%
mind and matter-- coexist,
collide, and interact?

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the energy
is all around us,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and energy is all connected to
all different types of energy,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
you can communicate with all
types of different things.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%

just need to think,

please may I turn my energy
on, or anything like that--

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:90%
a trigger of energy.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And then just turn it on.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And to Joseph.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite a warm
sensation inside your body.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It's quite tingly.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then your subconscious
mind kind of realizes it.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> As a kid, I met
him down an alleyway.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.133 align:middle line:10%
And ever since we've
been playing in my head,

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:10%
or somewhere else.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> But he speaks energy.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.825 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't speak our language.

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Like many children, when
I was young, I was very,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:10%
very sensitive.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Even at the age of
five, I realized

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I could perceive
the subtle energy.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I would look at someone,
and I would see the energy

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the emotions--
what they were going through.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I would put my hand up, and
I could hear their thoughts

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That got me on a journey
of discovery and research

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:90%
in the field of consciousness--

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness works
in the physical world,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and how we can answer
some of these questions.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:10%
For example, when we sense
the presence of someone

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:10%
but there's no one there,
what are we tapping into?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
What are we coming
in contact with?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
How can we perceive an event
before it happens, or remotely,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
at a distance?

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to change the
chemistry of your body, or even

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
your DNA?

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
How is it that you can
move a physical object

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
without any contact with
this physical object,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or use your consciousness to
see without your physical eyes?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The rain was tapping and
the windows and the wind was

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%
banging.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the phenomena
that we're exploring here,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with a new scientific approach
that could potentially explain

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:90%
it all.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that this field,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that we call parapsychology,
is not only widespread

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:90%
but it is universal.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I have about 100 articles
published in journals.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And each one of those usually
reports between one to five

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:90%
or six experiments--

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
so somewhere in the number
of hundreds of experiments.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
In terms of people involved, a
few thousand people, perhaps.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've studied probably
numbering in the hundreds

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:90%
of cases.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:10%
I've captured I don't know
how many dozens, or hundreds

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:10%
of what we call EVPs of
recordings of voices.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>> There are actually many
credible institutions around

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the world that have dedicated
many years of research in this

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
field of psi phenomena, or
what we call parapsychology.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
There are programs
in the government

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that ran for over 20
years, with millions

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:90%
of dollars in funding--

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
using psychic
abilities, for example,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.387 align:middle line:84%
to spy on the
foreign government.

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We know for a fact that the
Russians were involved in this.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:10%
We know for a fact that the
Chinese were and are probably

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:10%
still involved.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States government
and several other countries are

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
more open minded to this.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.492 align:middle line:90%
Russia comes to mind.

00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:10%
>> The Japanese
were very involved.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Sony Corporation had
a long, ongoing parapsychology

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:10%
program.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We know our own CIA had been
experimenting in psychic tests

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and abilities and
projects like MK-Ultra.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The Israelis had an
interest in it, and may still.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> >> It's very
well established.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> If these credible
institutions and governments

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
around the world are dedicating
so much research and funding

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
into this field, you would
think there is something there.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:10%
>> In graduate
school, in about 1970,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:10%
I saw a banner on the wall that
said, learn how to meditate.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
that I could debug

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
the software I was writing
in my nuclear physics studies

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
in a meditation state
much more accurately

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and quicker than I
could if I were actually

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:90%
looking at the printouts.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The lines that had
errors in them were red.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:90%
The others were black.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
crashed my reality.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time,
like most physicists,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I believed that if you
couldn't measure it,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
then it didn't exist.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So I would do
experiments, in that

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I could have one
of these effects

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and then change a variable--
and then do it again.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And then change that variable
a little more, and do it again.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
From consciousness, your intent
can modify future probability.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
It can modify what happens
in the physical world, which

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
means that consciousness
is the fundamental thing

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and the physical world is a
derivative of consciousness.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that consciousness
theory should also

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:90%
contain physics theory.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I finished my neurosurgical
training at Duke, in 1987,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:10%
and then I started work
at Harvard Medical School,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:10%
after doing a fellowship in
cerebrovascular neurosurgery--

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:10%
all along thinking I understood
something about brain, mind,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But that, of course,
was the tremendous gift

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
of my near-death experience, is
finding out that what I thought

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
was a world view that we just
assumed to be true is actually

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:90%
false--

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is primordial.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
All of this emergent
reality basically

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
emerges from consciousness.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And it opens the door
to a tremendous amount

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
about consciousness

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and the mind and the power
that human beings have

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:90%
over their unfolding reality.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
>> If consciousness
is fundamental,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
where does the physical world
end and consciousness begin?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:84%
>> The physical world is a
product of the consciousness

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:90%
One is within the other.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not an either/or.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all one thing.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It isn't as though
there's a physical world

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and there's a mental world.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%
There's only one world.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
localized in there.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's also not in space,
and it's not in time.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's somehow before
space and time.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what we mean
by fundamental.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a
kind of a substance--

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
a proto substance, perhaps--

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
which is usually in a
primordial refined state,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't even appear
to be matter or energy yet.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But from that can
emerge what we start

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%
seeing as the physical world.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.062 align:middle line:84%
Just like ice can take
on different phases,

00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe we're talking
about something

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
like consciousness, which
has different phases.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So if consciousness

century, in 1920 and 1930,

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:10%
pondered this quite a lot, and
concluded that consciousness

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:10%
must be there--

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:10%
even there was no direct
way of detecting it.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We could only see
its physical effects.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness as a
whole can be described

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
by the quantum attribute.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
quantum attribute does not

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
follow Newton's laws.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not physical.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an entirely different
part of the description

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:90%
of matter in the universe.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If the physical world
exists within consciousness,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
how come we can see
one and not the other?

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We see physical reality, and
we think that we are physical

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
bodies walking around in
this physical reality.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:90%
What we are is consciousness.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We are pieces of
consciousness playing

reality game called

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:90%
this physical world.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So a conscious comes
here with no memory.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So when it logs onto its avatar,
that avatar is all it knows.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So all of its
experience is experience

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%

fetus, with that newborn.

is that the computer

Can you imagine that description
of spin in the universe

starts with a global spin
of the universe, which then

And the stars in the
galaxies are all rotating.

been following what the Russians
were up to, and the Soviets,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:10%
and discovered
they were pursuing

And at a certain point, they
were having such good success

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%

00:14:57.783 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
At that point, then
it went operational,

that we have, that are untapped.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I am on such a path to
discover those and strengthen

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:90%
those and share them.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I couldn't
be more excited.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting the term
you used is superhuman.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that
it's normal human--

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that, yeah.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>> --that our society has
recognized the fact that this

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.240 align:middle line:90%
is part of normality.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So remote viewing is
an interesting thing.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:10%
It's a way of focusing
your subconscious mind.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:10%
Your subconscious
mind knows the answer.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:10%
It's your conscious
awareness that doesn't.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And so this source will
focus your subconscious mind.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But then, as you're going
to write this stuff down,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that's a way of bringing that
into your conscious awareness,

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to try to get your
subconscious talking

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:90%
to your conscious awareness.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to narrow down
the very core elements,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to give you at least a flavor
of how remote viewing works.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I would love to try.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a crash course.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a crash course.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Every molecule of every atom
that's here, we have over here.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> After a few hours of
intense training with Paul,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.943 align:middle line:84%
Rachele felt ready
for the next step.

00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're going to do
is called it an outbounder

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So Caroline and a
couple other folks

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
will pick a target
outside of here,

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
where we won't be able
to know what it is.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Then they will go
to that target,

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and they will interact
with it as best they can.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they can touch it,
or feel it, or smell it,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
or ride around that,
whatever it is.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile, we'll be back here.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
find them, consciously.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You're going to send
your consciousness there

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to find where they are, and then
you'll report on the location

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
where they're at.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you pick up on it,
you'll report on the things

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:90%
that they're doing.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So just to clarify, you
don't know where we're going?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I have no idea.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So are you ready?

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.389 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm ready.

00:19:03.389 --> 00:19:05.854 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Rachele, what you're
going to do is you're going

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to direct your consciousness
to the location where Caroline,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Evan, and Dylan have gone.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to attempt
to perceive and describe

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
the setting that they're in.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
The interesting things
are hard to see.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the things
there are to experience,

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.238 align:middle line:84%
kind of pay attention
to what they're--

00:19:44.238 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
don't focus in on
what they're doing.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But if something happens
that attracts your attention,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.607 align:middle line:90%
make note of that.

00:19:49.607 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
verbalizing this as you go.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be writing
down the impressions you get.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to be sketching.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So to get that started,
I want you to write down,

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Caroline location.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Just start kind of
perceiving and describing,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in descriptive kind of terms,
what you were experiencing.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I see laughter.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So you hear laughing sounds.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I hear laughing sounds.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Just put down laughing.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm asked if I like
to see black lines.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Something red-- yeah,
a feeling of red.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like Caroline
is holding something.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.531 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Probably just put that down.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It feels like it's black--

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:90%
like a black feeling.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> How does it feel?

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Dense.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Does it have a texture to it?

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:90%
It was as rough.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Like, smooth, but rough.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds weird.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Just place your
point of view above,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and see if you get
anything interesting

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.796 align:middle line:90%
from that perspective.

00:21:23.796 --> 00:21:24.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:21:24.596 --> 00:21:27.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Try and take care
of a bird's eye view.

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm seeing mountains and red.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.552 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.552 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're having some
experience with like a red--

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.135 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want
to see him fall,

00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:40.448 align:middle line:84%
but like a circular red
thing, and then lots of it.

00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:42.115 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
really if it's Caroline

00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:44.857 align:middle line:90%
or that there's like a black--

00:21:44.857 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:84%
it's like someone
is holding something

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:90%
that is black and, like, solid.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And something hot-- like whether
it's a hot drink, or something

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:90%
that's hot, that's liquid.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
Starbucks on this side.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.017 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I keep
thinking of Starbucks,

00:22:00.017 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
but it's coming up for me.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.875 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it down.

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:84%
My mind keeps
going to Starbucks.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:90%
So you wrote it down.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You can let it go.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let it go, yep.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:09.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:09.998 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
like there's noise.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just like noise going on.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.007 align:middle line:84%
For some reason,
I'm seeing a chain

00:22:31.007 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:90%
that lay Christmas lights.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, decorative lights, yeah.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If the universe can
connect two minds,

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be
interesting to try something

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:84%
different with this
remote-viewing experiment.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I attempted to block
Rachel's consciousness

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.955 align:middle line:90%
from viewing our location.

00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of going back
to what I know, you know?

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like a
good place to end.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.543 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead and write them down.

00:23:03.543 --> 00:23:05.205 align:middle line:90%
So gather up your pages.

00:23:05.205 --> 00:23:06.005 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:09.097 align:middle line:90%
And we will head out.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.093 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is insane.

00:23:22.093 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Lights-- everyone
put down lights.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought,
there's Christmas lights.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's a declarative
lights in the front,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and a whole building is a
structure that's unleveled.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.515 align:middle line:90%
Like, I am mind blown right now.

00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go check it out.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.152 align:middle line:90%
Really, I can't believe it.

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I literally can't believe it.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.193 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happened?

00:23:42.193 --> 00:23:44.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, one of
the biggest things I picked up

00:23:44.693 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
on was decorative lights.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.897 align:middle line:84%
Like, I literally wrote
like Christmas lights,

00:23:47.897 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:90%
decorative, lights.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.685 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:23:49.685 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a Christmas tree.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
- That's a Christmas tree.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And right here you can see,
I wrote, lights, Christmas,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:90%
decorative.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I did
is I walked all the way

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
to the Christmas tree.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I kept seeing this
kind of reddish color--

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, like
all the buildings--

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Are red.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Are red.

00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> But I also said,
remember the circular thing,

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%
it's the carousel.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So I said, there's
this red feeling,

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that's like almost like a
circular feeling, that is that.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So then I came this way.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I was holding on to
this thing and looking up

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:90%
to the Christmas tree.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I said, gray and black bars.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And then we saw this.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.457 align:middle line:84%
We were just so curious, like
what you were thinking about.

00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember I said as
well, I talked about noise

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and kids' laughter and playing.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally--
I'm so mindblown.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.023 align:middle line:90%
How did I get this right?

00:24:46.023 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So then what else did
you do while you were here?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.462 align:middle line:84%
>> So I came this way, and I
touched these bars like this.

00:24:51.462 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> See, and I kept
seeing the bars.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And I did this.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And again, just the fact that
I said, Caroline holding black,

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:90%
dense, rough structures.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And then later, I even
drew bars down here.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, I drew black bars.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And I kept feeling
and sensing that.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I came
up with Starbucks.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, nope, I'm going
to write that on the left side.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I want to get rid of that.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And over here on the next page,
you can see, I wrote Starbucks.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Are there Starbucks
involved I don't know about?

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:90%
You guys got a Starbucks?

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I should have warned you--
don't take any side trips.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's a
hot liquid involved.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So then that led to
the Starbucks thing.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, oh, crud,
did they stop at Starbucks?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I told them not to do that.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Towards the end of the process--

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:84%
they say the last
five minutes or so--

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
did you feel like
you were having

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
any difference in
your experience

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:90%
and your perceptions?

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Were they stronger?

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Were they weaker?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> All I know is that there was
a specific point when I felt

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:90%
like, that's it.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.545 align:middle line:90%
There's no more words.

00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, it
just kept coming up

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:90%
and coming up and coming up.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.985 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
definitely a certain point

00:25:57.985 --> 00:25:59.193 align:middle line:90%
where I didn't have any more.

00:25:59.193 --> 00:26:00.068 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:26:00.068 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:90%
There was just no more.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That validates that
she was at the target.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.453 align:middle line:84%
>> It shows that there's a
boundary condition that you can

00:26:07.453 --> 00:26:09.870 align:middle line:84%
interrupt the process with,
which shows there is a process

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
to be interrupted.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
This was a crash course
in just a few hours.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have never
been here before.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
What did you learn
about yourself?

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it just
reconfirmed, for me,

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the belief that we have so much
more capabilities than we think

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
we do, you know?

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think, if you
can have an open mind

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and learn and try
new things, who knows

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
what you'll be capable of?

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Especially after this
experience, if we could all

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:90%
live just in more curiosity--

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.018 align:middle line:84%
not trying so hard,
but just being

00:26:38.018 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:84%
curious about life and
about our abilities,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we could achieve
so much more-- as well

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
as just experience and
enjoy life so much more.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> When the CIA
declassified the program,

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
they conveniently left out
all of the assessments from

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
the people who
used our material.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
they didn't want people

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:90%
to know how successful it was.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Two minds can be
telepathically connected.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:84%
There is a path of coherence
with this spinning attribute

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, that's
joining the two minds.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
These quantum waves
describing the structure

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
of my hand and this couch
and your body and the tree

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.480 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the room--

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
all of these waves are
standing, describing

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.410 align:middle line:84%
the physical structure
of a body, which

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
will remain fixed
in the universe

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:84%
according to Newton's
laws for physical matter.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Two physical particles can
share properties at a distance,

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:90%
through entanglement.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Now everyone is plugged
into the same field.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So if consciousness
waves are spiraling,

00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
they carry the same pattern
as the larger, unified field.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:90%
They become coherent.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And through entanglement, the
consciousness of one person

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
could become entangled with
that of another, at a distance.
