>> What makes people
truly fulfilled?

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it love, family,
success, or is it

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
finding out who you really are,
what you are truly made of,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
so you know your purpose here
on Earth and your connection

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:90%
to the universe?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We exist as physical beings
in a physical reality,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
while our mind is in
constant communication

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
with unseen forces
and unknown worlds.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
We are the visible part
of a potentially infinite

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:90%
invisible realm.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
How do the two worlds, mind
and matter, coexist, collide,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.044 align:middle line:90%
and interact?

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:90%
PK is short for psychokinesis.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the ability to
move a physical object

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
without physical contact.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:10%
I've been working with PK
for the past couple of years

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:10%
with very interesting results.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It is your Intent
that is interacting

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
with the physical object that
is getting it to respond.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But the minute you
let go of the results

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:90%
is when you get the result.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
At the Institute of Biosensory
Psychology in St. Petersburg,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Russia, you can learn how
to use your consciousness

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to move a physical object.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
A graduate from this institute
is UC Berkeley's quantum

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
physicist, Dr.
George Weissman, who

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
has been able to demonstrate
these effects repeatedly

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and over the past several years.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's just a
freely suspended object,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:10%
and it's inside the glass
cylinder so that it's isolated

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:10%
from the heat, from
draft, and so on.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
If you leave it alone,
it doesn't move at all.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
What we do is to basically
focus on it and make it turn.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So from the audio
physics perspective,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:90%
this is impossible.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there's
consciousness in those objects.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Objects and space and time
all are manifestations

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:90%
within consciousness.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of unification.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Matter, so-called particles, are
more like information carriers.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Particles are not things.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Even once you've seen it,
it's not an actual existing

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
particle, but then it can
be thought of in a way.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It is described by this
wave function, which

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:90%
is just a probability function.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I asked PK practitioner
and meditation teacher,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Sean McNamara, to facilitate
a session with my friend,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Rachele, who had never practiced
PK before and was eager to try.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Sean, I'm so excited about this.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, too.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I mentioned Rachele to you.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't tell you
how excited I am.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:90%
I cannot wait to learn.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.303 align:middle line:10%
>> It sounds like you have
a lot of confidence already,

00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:10%
like some part of you already
believes that it's possible.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:10%
Is that true?

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, I do.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:10%
I have been studying and so
passionate about the power

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:10%
of thought and intention.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.732 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ever since
I was 14, I know--

00:04:56.732 --> 00:04:58.815 align:middle line:84%
I went through a really
difficult time in my life.

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I saw a movie that
changed my life,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and I had this very
life-changing experience.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I want to perform.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to act.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.453 align:middle line:84%
I want to inspire people just
like that film did for me.

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Through focusing on that,
intending it, writing it down,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and having vision boards, seeing
it, watching it every day,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
seeing myself do it
every day, I ended up

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.592 align:middle line:84%
playing the lead in the
sequel to that same film

00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
six years later,
something that everybody

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
told me was impossible.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Where you place your
awareness is where energy goes.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
all we're doing here

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:84%
with this psychokinesis
experiment.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to produce
movement by using

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:90%
our mind in a certain way.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's really
like baking a cake.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
You put all the right
ingredients together,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and you put them in the oven,
and you give it enough time.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And when enough
time has passed, you

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
pull out this beautiful,
delicious cake.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> And no calories involved.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a meditation process in
itself and the way other types

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
of meditation have those
life lessons wrapped in.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
You see it's right in
front of your eyes.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're too tense,
it stops moving.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.057 align:middle line:84%
When you relax, it
starts moving again.

00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
If you don't give it enough
time, it doesn't work.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:90%
If you let go, it works.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is just another way
of showing those basic life

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.543 align:middle line:84%
principles that
we all know about.

00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point, we
can lift up your container,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and you'll want to do this very
slowly, because when you do it

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.337 align:middle line:84%
too quickly, it knocks off
the tin foil from the needle.

00:06:16.337 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:10%
And then you'll want to just
put your hands on the glass

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:10%
on either side of the object.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, it'll
start responding

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:10%
to your breathing pattern and
to the level of relaxation

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:10%
in your mind.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, when it
starts, it means

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.928 align:middle line:10%
that the shift has
occurred within you,

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:10%
and your mind just
started responding, too.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:10%
So I think we're
sharing a field now.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it working?

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That is so cool to watch.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it
was totally still.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.665 align:middle line:90%
>> It's moving.

00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
as maybe silly to some
as this may sound,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
sending love to the material,
saying, like, I love you.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's work
together on this.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's be one.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
You know, let's move together.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Look what it's doing as
you're talking about love.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Your heart's opening as
you're talking about it,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:10%
and it feels it.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can also feel whenever
I start to feel those ego

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
thoughts or wanting to get it
right or afraid of failure,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
then there's this disconnect.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's so
powerful to understand

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that that's the
whole thing of ego

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:90%
is the want to get it right is--

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%
can block you.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you just allow, and
be filled with love and energy,

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
amazing, miraculous
things can happen.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Rachele will now attempt
to place two objects inside

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
the glass container and
see if she could, perhaps,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
influence one object
and not the other.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:10%
>> I was wondering if I am
here, I'll have more ability.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Keep going, because the other
one just started moving.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's working.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Clearly, Rachele's talented.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that is, like, amazing.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's her first time.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the hardest
condition to be under.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:10%
Not only is it your
first time, but you

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:10%
have six cameras on you.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
There are other people in
the room watching, hoping,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
expecting.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the hardest
conditions for anyone

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to operate under
for a psychokinesis,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:90%

it's so much fun.

After even just those two
experiments, you know,

I learned so much about myself.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
If you practice these
things, you really

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The rods and cones are
producing an electrical signal

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that goes to the back
of my brain, which

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.323 align:middle line:90%
reconstructs an image.

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm really
looking at when

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I look at the piece of paper,
tin foil, or a toothpick,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is I'm moving,
I'm looking at my own mind.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
If we were truly
separate from each other,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
there's no way we'd be
able to do PK because

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of the inherent separateness.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we can dissolve
that sense that we're

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
separate from everything
and increase the sense

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're already one,
then that makes PK possible.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
possible, because when

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving an object,
I'm moving my own mind.

the University of California

His interest in PK began after
a profoundly transformative zen

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
meditation experience, which
led him to alter entirely

>> I started working
with Mike in 2017,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:10%
and I was most impressed by
the scientific rigor he brings

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:10%
to the field and also how
far we were able to stretch

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:10%
the boundaries and possibilities
of this methodology.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:10%
>> And the model that I think
is probably more truthful is

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:10%
a model that actually a famous
physicist, John Wheeler,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:10%
developed, which he calls
the Participative Universe.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:10%
Instead of having
the camera or the eye

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and then a display
in this linear,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:10%
sort of causal
relationship, the universe

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:10%
is actually this
self-excitatory loop,

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:10%
where there is no separation
between the observer

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:10%
and the observed,
but because they

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:10%
form this continuous
interactive feedback.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
I started to believe

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
in the possibility of PK, as a
scientist, because the object

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
is truly not outside of you.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's so-- for example,
if I want to move my finger,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:84%
my finger is connected
to my consciousness

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
through neural pathways in
the body and to my brain.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I want to move
it, it's a part of me,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and I can move it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The piece of paper
in front of me

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
is not physically connected
with neural pathways.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:10%
But it still is a
phenomenon and an appearance

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:10%
within my consciousness, what
you might call a back channel.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
the brain and, actually,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
all the cells in our
body are phenomenon

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
occurring within this
bigger consciousness.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea is, then, to try to
influence this piece of paper

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:10%
that's totally isolated
and get it to rotate.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> To rotate without any effect
from any known physical forces.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You explained to me that it's
actually quite difficult to do

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
it with a vacuum, so there's--

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, it's impossible,
so not just difficult,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
which is why I've
added a little twist,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
which actually allows me to
accomplish this in a vacuum.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Something very similar to
this is inside the container.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
doing is I'm adding

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
random mechanical fluctuations
or perturbations to the target

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
by controlling the
amplitude of the signal

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:90%
it gets to the speaker.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We can control the amplitude
and how much motion is actually

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
induced in the target, but
typically, it's probably

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:90%
less than a millimeter.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't cause any large
scale order rotation,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
but, rather, just this
very small oscillation

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:90%
of the target.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
The standard protocol for doing
a proper experimental design

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is you obtain a
baseline period, just

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
establishing that
there is no motion,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
environmental effect.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying when we
are creating the baseline over

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
several hours, this very small
linear oscillation is taken

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:90%
into account.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, and will be visible.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>> And will be visible.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So we know that by the time
you're influencing the target,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we see a big difference,
and we see the rotation that

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
is coming from the
consciousness or the intent

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to from
the little speaker.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.393 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let
you try it yourself.

00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave
you some space.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So Mike, how did it go?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can see,
here's the baseline,

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and it shows that the target is
randomly moving back and forth.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So maybe like a degree
or so from peak to peak.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And then at this point here,
you see a larger rotation.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
I am willing with my mind

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and saying, "move," or
do this like a command,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
but rather, it's much more of
a feeling of connectedness.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It is becoming clear that
mind and matter are entangled,

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and the separation between
objects and consciousness is

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:90%
nothing but an illusion.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
If that is the
case, then I should

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
be able to influence
the same physical object

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
in close proximity or, perhaps,
1,000 miles away across two

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's find out.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, nice to see you again.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, you, too.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:10%
Have you been practicing?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I'm looking forward
to another session tonight.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> How long have you been
running the device before I

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:90%
came on?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have about
an hour baseline,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll do your session,
which is usually typically you

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
run about an hour or so.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I continue after
you're done running a continued

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:90%
baseline afterwards.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:90%

It was just, like, turning.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That's really something
I haven't seen before--

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.358 align:middle line:84%
having it rotate multiple
times in succession like that.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that people
who are watching would say this

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:90%
is a fluke?

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Could this ever be a
fluke, since the baseline

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
was established for so long?

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Typically, during
the baselines,

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:10%
it's completely
motionless and still.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:10%
So I'm confident that
the results we're getting

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:10%
are being really provided
by your intention

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:10%
and not by any other kinds
of environmental factors

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:10%
that could be
influencing the target.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:10%
Every time we continue to
get these good results,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:10%
I become even more confident
that this is a true phenomenon

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:10%
and that you really are
providing the trigger

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:10%
for these rotations.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> My theory is when we perform
PK or any other mind over

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
matter exercise, our
consciousness switches

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
the brain from
linear functioning,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
firing randomly in different
areas, to 100% capacity,

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
whereby the brain
functions as a whole.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:10%
In fact, without knowing
the anatomy of the brain,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:10%
all you have to do
is focus your intent

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:10%
on the center of the brain.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that information
is then distributed

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
through the corpus callosum
to the two hemispheres, which

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
allows you to understand
what's going on,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and through the endocrine
system, which then allows

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:90%
you to feel what is going on.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain is now engaged
at its full 100% capacity,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
you can now perceive
and experience things

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
beyond the normal human range,
meaning beyond time and space.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
If this is true,
then we should be

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
able to transcend any limitation
of our physicality, perhaps

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
even our eyesight.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Our first stop is

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
we encounter children who are
using blindfolds to access

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.390 align:middle line:90%
their superhuman abilities.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:90%
We're going to play some games.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Put your blindfolds
on for me, please.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Justin, tell me
what's on this card.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Teacup.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, tell me
what's on this card.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> A tiger.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Isabella, what is the
shape and color of this stone?

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like a circle, and
I don't-- and it's not really--

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of, like, see-through.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's yet another example of
how consciousness can interact

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:84%
with the physical world beyond
what science claims to be

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>> When we work
with the blindfold,

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:10%
it's so that we can encourage
the children to use the vision

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:10%
that they have with their
higher consciousness.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Evie, tell me the shape
and color of the stone.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's red and
kind of a circle.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Evie, tell me what I'm
holding in my hand.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> A wooden spoon.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We expand their consciousness
beyond that they believe

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
or understand that they can
take themselves into universal

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now let's go search
for that beautiful inner light

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:90%
of yours.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I can see it.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Bring the light out into
the area around you--

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:90%
your light field.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I've done it.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Good boy.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I can see it.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And then they can work
with the higher consciousness,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
seeing, because they have the
potential to see from every

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
cell in their body.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're going
to read a line each.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The other dragons were purple
with smooth, shiny scales,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
but Marmaduke was faded
orange with sticky-out scales.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:10%
>> It's like
witnessing a miracle.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.150 align:middle line:10%
It's really-- it's just
beautiful to watch.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.975 align:middle line:84%
>> George was enjoying a quiet
evening in the Heavenly Hippos

00:20:17.975 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Wildlife Park.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, he spotted a group
of animals creeping past.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The first time I
actually saw it for myself,

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:10%
when I'd come to do my training,
the only word I can think of is

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:10%
"emotional."

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It was very emotional.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Pitter-patter.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The rain was tapping
in the windows,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:90%
and the wind was banging.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:10%
>> When my son started to
read, and I saw him reading--

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Are they out is ruined.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> They kind of shine.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> No mouse would put a
paw out in that weather.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Needless to say, I wanted
to know what it felt like

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to experience the physical
world through these blindfolds.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally dark, yes.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Witnessing these incredible
children up close got us

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:84%
on a journey to discovering
others around the world who are

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
applying similar methodologies
to achieve mindblowing results.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
At MP USA in Ogden, Utah,
a blindfold technique

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
called Vibravision
helps you sense

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.645 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of various
objects in the physical world.

00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> All physical matter in the
universe is actually a form

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
of energy that's
made up of atoms.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:10%
And those atoms are
cycling or vibrating

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:10%
at a certain frequency.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Practicing Vibravision
gives us the ability

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to access our sensors and to
perceive those vibrations,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and then convert it into
a usable mental image we

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%
call mindsight.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Red, yellow, blue,
yellow, orange, blue, green.

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:08.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:08.925 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see the unseen to
do things that are thought

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:90%
of as impossible.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Eight of clubs, 10 of
diamonds, five of hearts.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> One, two, three.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> At MP USA, folks of all ages
demonstrate these incredible

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Gumbo, OK.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> How much did it cost again?

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> $29.98.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And Colton, what were
you just touching?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> These are fan boxes.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:90%
What color is that?

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's blue.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.225 align:middle line:84%

the Lays brand.

00:22:54.225 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.625 align:middle line:90%
Old Spice body wash.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

>> From Utah, we make our
way to Stuttgart, Germany.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:84%

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%

myself, my reaction was, wow,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:90%

I decided to investigate the
origin of these methodologies,

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
which led me to Infovision
in Moscow, Russia,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and its founder,
Mark Komissarov, who

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Then I tried it with
adults, and it turns out

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.818 align:middle line:84%
the methodology also
works with adults.

00:24:55.818 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:10%
what you want to experience.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what this is about--

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:90%
mind over matter.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:84%
If the current scientific
laws of physical reality

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
were accurate and complete, then
they shouldn't be broken ever.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet these laws are being
broken every day, repeatedly,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
by hundreds of people
around the world.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
The bottom line is this.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:90%
No matter what you believe in--

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
if you believe we live in
a matrix, in someone else's

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
simulation, or if you
believe in God or Buddha,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.900 align:middle line:84%
or if you're an atheist,
and there's nothing

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:90%
beyond this physical world--

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful technology in
the universe is consciousness.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
If your consciousness
can change the chemistry

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
of your body, if your
consciousness can allow you

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to see perfectly without
the use of your eyes,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:84%
if your consciousness
can allow you

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:84%
to move a physical object
without physical contact,

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
if you can influence
an electrical device,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.860 align:middle line:84%
an electronic
device, or a computer

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:84%
nearby or at a distance, well,
then who's more powerful-- you

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:90%
or the physical world?

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Consciousness evolves
by lowering its entropy.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.970 align:middle line:90%
It does that by making choices.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:10%
And by those choices,
the individuated use

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.080 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness can evolve
if they make good choices

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:10%
toward caring, toward
love, toward consideration,

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:10%
or they can make poor
choices and de-evolve

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.070 align:middle line:10%
toward fear, self-centeredness.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:10%
It's all about me.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.660 align:middle line:10%
>> We live in a world where
freedom and free will are part

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:10%
of the design.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And within that, there's
choices that can be made,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and those choices have impact
throughout the entire quantum

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:84%
field, all great distances
from our thoughts

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and how that bounces off and
echoes out of the matrix,

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and how that bounces
back and influences us.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's a dialogue
going on with that.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.100 align:middle line:10%
>> So we sort of
come to this world,

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.120 align:middle line:10%
and I guess in our
materialistic sense,

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:10%
we want to forget the
vibrations and things like that.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
We just want to think
of matter and stuff.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What part of your life has
been the most significant?

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'll bet it's not the stuff.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not the car.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not the house you live in.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.490 align:middle line:90%
It's there, and it's important.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:84%
You need your car to
get around and so on,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but what's really
important in your life

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:84%
are your relationships,
the caring, the love,

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.610 align:middle line:84%
the significance of
connecting with other people.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:10%
>> What am I doing here?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:10%
I know.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.120 align:middle line:10%
I have to pass on my this, and
I have to give my kids this,

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:10%
and I have to-- it's
all of this stuff.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Love, I think, is the
main reason we are here.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, knowing that that's
it allows me to look at every

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:84%
day, and just I'm
in love with life.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose of the
universe is for life to emerge

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and thrive.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:10%
We believe that these
principles are universe-wide.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The purpose in so many
ways of existence is to know

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:90%
thyself.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The self-awareness
of the universe

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is profound quality
of awareness,

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of conscious awareness
of existence,

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
is inherent in the
universe itself.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Exploring your superhuman
abilities allows you

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to discover your own
potential, the mechanics

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, understand
who you really are.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:84%
As you think, as you
feel, as you make choices,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.870 align:middle line:84%
you contribute to the expansion
of humanity as a whole,

00:38:56.870 --> 00:39:01.760 align:middle line:84%
from a limited state of being
to an elevated superhuman

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:84%
species that fits
within the grand design

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.500 align:middle line:90%
of an intelligent universe.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So now ask yourself,
are you a superhuman?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:90%
