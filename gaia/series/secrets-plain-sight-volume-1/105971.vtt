00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>Let's see if you can guess
the final city in my world tour.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Here we are over a
semipublic urban park.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I was drawn to this
place when I read

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:84%
it had a small Egyptian
pyramid folly, nine

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.580 align:middle line:84%
gates, and a fifth
generation watchman, who

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:84%
lives in the diminutive
rotunda building right here.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Five generations of watchmen
living in a tiny pavilion

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
must be motivated to guard
something pretty interesting.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
The informal layout and curving
walkways say English garden,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:84%
but having been immersed
in London, something bigger

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
popped out at me--
the shape of the park.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It closely matches the ancient
walls of the city of London.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
This park was built by the
richest man in the country, who

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:90%
was also a king's cousin.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.730 align:middle line:84%
He was a lover of all things
English and enemy of all things

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:90%
royalist.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
He ended up being beheaded like
so many others of his time.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
If you guessed Paris,
you're correct.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We entered the City of
Light through the portal

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of Parc Monceau, established
by Louis Philippe

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:90%
II, Duke d'Orleans.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
As you may have guessed,
the Duke of Orleans

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%
was a Freemason.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
He actually served
as grand master

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
of the governing body of French
Freemasonry, the grand orient

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of France.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid in Parc Monceau
is trivial, however,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
compared to what the
Louvre Pyramid encodes.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:10%
President Francois Mitterrand
commissioned the Louvre Pyramid

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:10%
and the adjacent
pyramid in Versailles

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:10%
to be completed by 1989 for the
celebration of the bicentennial

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:10%
of the French Revolution.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Mitterrand personally
selected architect, IM Pei,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
without hosting a
design competition,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
as would be expected for
such an important commission.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The modern pyramid's
metal armature

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
support a lot of glass.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:10%
Wikipedia states that the
official brochure published

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:10%
during construction cited
666 as its number of panes,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:10%
but then writes it off
as an urban legend,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:10%
because in actual
fact, the pyramid

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:10%
contains a different
number of panes.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
That didn't stop various
journalists at the time

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
from drumming up
quite a controversy

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
about the number of the beast,
and Mitterrand was jokingly

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the
Sun King for a while.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
However, I have indeed
found 666 rhombi

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:90%
symbolized in the pyramid.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Why rhombi, you ask?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:10%
A rhombus can be made from
two conjoined equilateral

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:10%
triangles.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:10%
The rhombus is the
masculine or linear element

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:10%
inside the feminine curves
of the Vesica Pisces,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:10%
whose name means
vessel of the fish,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:10%
because the Christian fish
symbol emerges from it.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The rhombus is, therefore,
a sacred symbol.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Notice how each of the
larger rhombic frames

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:84%
contains 36 rhombic
panes of glass.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:10%
As you can see, the number of
rhombic panes on a typical face

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:10%
adds up to 153.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:10%
This is a very
interesting number

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:10%
that has a mystical
Christian significance.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:10%
Do you remember the
square root of 153

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:10%
being equal to the number
of moons in a year?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:10%
We learned that fact
by studying Stonehenge.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's a quote from
the New Testament

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that entangles fish and
153 in a Christian net.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
"Simon Peter went
up and drew the net

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to land full of great
fishes, 150 and three,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and for all, there were so many,
yet was not the net broken."

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
This number of fish-- I mean,
why bother enumerating them--

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
has puzzled scholars
for centuries

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and is an example
of how parables

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible encrypt important
information in plain text.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus describing his
practice of hiding information

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
in symbols.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
"He answered and said
unto them, 'Because it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is given unto you to
know the mysteries

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of the kingdom of Heaven,
but to them, it is not given.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, I speak
to them in parables,

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:10%
because they seeing see not,
and hearing they hear not,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:10%
neither do they understand.'"

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Tabulating the
additional triangles

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and converting them to
rhombi and then adding

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:10%
the number of rhombic frames,
we get 166.5 symbolic rhombi

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:10%
in a typical face, and
four such faces equals 666.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
actual Bible quote

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and see what it tells us in
regard to the infamous number

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.204 align:middle line:90%
of the beast.

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:90%
"Here is wisdom.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
for it is the number
of man, and his number

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:90%
is 600 threescore and six."

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Why man is called
a beast should be

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
obvious by what humans
are doing to this planet's

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
natural environment.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
We may bestial in our
an unenlightened state,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
but this is beside
the point I'm making.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The beast here is
not Satan, but man.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.715 align:middle line:84%
In particular, the Louvre
Pyramid is about a man.

00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Robert Bauval had a stunning
realization described

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:10%
in the book, "Talisman."

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:10%
He realized the
historic core of Paris

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:10%
is correlated with the temples
of Luxor and Karnak in Egypt.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:10%
Luxor and Karnak are
adjacent ancient temples.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:10%
Bauval observed that
the six-degree angle

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:10%
between the axes
of Luxor and Karnak

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:10%
match the six-degree
bend in the Louvre.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:10%
The temple of Luxor
is the one with

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:10%
the embedded six-degree angle.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:10%
I went a step further and
laid the Luxor ground plan

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:10%
over the Louvre and
the Tuileries Garden.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
The Tuileries was
laid out by Le Notre

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:90%
at the request of Louis XIV.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:10%
We see this direct
correlation only

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:10%
when the temple
plan is mirrored.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:10%
Might the Sun King's
intention have been for Paris

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:10%
to be the mirror of Luxor?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:10%
Validation that
the temple of Luxor

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:10%
was used as a design
template is the fact

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:10%
that the obelisk corrected
in the Place de la Concorde

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:10%
is from the very
same temple of Luxor.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
After the revolution,
the Luxor obelisk

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
replaced the guillotine in what
became known as the Place de la

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Concorde.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:10%
In an outstanding
act of engineering,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:10%
the obelisk was erected
by the aforementioned Duke

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:10%
of Orleans' son, who many years
after the 1789 revolution,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:10%
became the last king of France.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
to recognize here

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the French obsession
with hermetic symbolism

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:84%
passed through the revolution
completely unscathed.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle line:10%
In the early 20th century,
modern French alchemist,

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:10%
Schwaller de Lubicz, lived
in Luxor for 15 years.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:10%
Out of his intensive study came
the book, "The Temple of Man,"

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:10%
wherein he showed how
the Temple of Luxor

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:10%
represents the body of a man.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Now we're really
on to something.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I see the head here, the
neck, the heart, all the way

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to the small chambers
of the intestines here.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:10%
The obelisk is, of
course, his erect phallus.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians related
the cult of the phallus

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
with the dismemberment
of Osiris.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:10%
Next, I overlaid the most famous
depiction of the human body

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:10%
ever made-- Leonardo da
Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
See how his leg follows
the bend in the scene?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
These roads follow the
angle of his other leg,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Luxembourg Gardens
seem to parallel his arm.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Could the Vitruvian Man
be another hidden template

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.710 align:middle line:90%
in the design of Paris?

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.431 align:middle line:84%
If so, I suspect the
man of Paris is Osiris.

00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Thinking on this, I started
to see energy centers

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in the parterres
of the Tuileries.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
they were chakras,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
but their locations tell a
slightly different story.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
In a normal state
of consciousness,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:90%
people don't see chakras.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:10%
However, as we
learned at Chartres,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:10%
chakras rows are part of the
architecture of the universe

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:10%
we've been investigating.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:10%
If chakras exist on
another level of reality--

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:10%
call it the etheric body
or aura, if you will-- then

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:10%
their interface in
our everyday reality

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:10%
is controlled by the endocrine
system in the physical body.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:10%
Why do we care?

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:10%
Because stimulating and
balancing the endocrine

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:10%
system can lead to
states of ecstasy using

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:10%
more of the brain,
slowing the aging process,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:10%
attaining enlightenment,
and even experiencing

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:10%
everlasting life,
as some believe.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I was able to pinpoint
gland locations in Paris

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.640 align:middle line:90%
because of another observation.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Many famous public spaces have
axial streets pointing directly

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to where the ductless glands
would be in the body of a man.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The Church of the Madeleine
and Palais Bourbon

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
form a cross-axis directly
in line with the obelisk

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in La Place de la Concorde.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:10%
On one side, we have
Napoleon's Church

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:10%
venerating Mary
Magdalene, who is

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:10%
said to have started the royal
bloodline of the Son of God.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:10%
On the other side is
the Palais Bourbon

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:10%
containing the lower
house of the Parliament

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:10%
of France, known as
the National Assembly.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:10%
These two Roman styled
temples energize the gonads

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:10%
in the body of Paris on either
side of his phallus centered

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:10%
on the Axe Historique.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The gland most associated
with enlightened states

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, the
pineal, which actually

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
looks like a tiny pine cone in
the center of the human brain.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:10%
This colossal pine cone is in
the courtyard of the Belvedere

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:10%
in the Vatican, a
name which recalls

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:10%
the affluent town of the same
name overlooking San Francisco.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:10%
The pine cone is flanked
by two peacocks, which

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:10%
are ancient symbols
of Resurrection,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:10%
that predate Christianity.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:10%
Believe it or not, there
is an empty black coffin

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't get a picture
of behind the colossal pine

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:10%
cone that symbolizes the
death and rebirth of Osiris.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:10%
The pine cone in the
private courtyard

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:10%
is actually a first
century bronze

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:10%
that used to act as a fountain
in front of the Temple of Isis

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Rome.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Renaissance, Sixtus
V built the library wing

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that closed off the
courtyard, perhaps

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
in order to hide pagan
symbols not easily explained

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholic church.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:10%
The pineal gland of
Paris marks one end point

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:10%
of a line starting at the Paris
Observatory, whose construction

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:10%
was incidentally
authorized by Louis XIV.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:10%
This axis passes directly
through the French Senate

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:10%
and the Luxembourg Gardens.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
This cosmic connection
to enlightenment

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:90%
is not lost on me.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Also notable is the fact that
nothing aligns with the thymus

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:90%
or throat chakra.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:10%
As the throat is associated
with speaking and communication,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:10%
it seems appropriate nothing
should energize this center

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:10%
if secrecy is to be maintained.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Each of the other alignments
is an interesting case study

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.678 align:middle line:90%
for further analysis.

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Parc Monceau is right under
the Vitruvian Man's foot.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:84%
His outstretched leg
seems to point directly

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:84%
at the rotunda building
where the gatekeeper lives.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
The tiny rotunda was
designed by architect,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Claude Nicolas Ledoux, an
interesting figure to be sure.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Ledoux built 63 toll
barrier buildings

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
in the city wall built around
Paris in the Ancien regime

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:90%
to collect taxes.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
This tax wall was
universally hated

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and was torn down
during the revolution.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:10%
When the Paris
metro was built, it

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:10%
made sense to dig
up the city where

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:10%
the extra space for the wall
had been, so metro lines 2 and 6

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:10%
follow the tax wall boundary.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:10%
Only three of Ledoux's tax
structures remain today,

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:10%
and the rotunda in Parc
Monceau is one of them.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:10%
I submit that it's no accident
that precisely these Ledoux

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:10%
buildings were left intact.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:10%
We already know
about the rotunda,

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:10%
but what is the significance
of these other two Ledoux

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:10%
buildings?

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:10%
They're all about
solar alignment.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:10%
The red line pointing
to the Rotunda de la

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:10%
Vilette in Place
Stalingrad precisely

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:10%
marks the azimuth of
summer solstice sunrise.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Look at how this water channel
continues the alignment.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Some other examples of this
alignment we've seen before

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:10%
are the line connecting
the Vatican obelisk

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:10%
with the obelisk in
Piazza del Popolo

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:10%
and in the orientation
of Chartres Cathedral.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:10%
The green line pointing
to the Barriere d'Enfer,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.510 align:middle line:10%
or Gate of Hell, is oriented
appropriately due south.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Gate of Hell,
because Ledoux's pair of tax

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:10%
collection buildings
are immediately

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:10%
adjacent to the entrance
of the Paris catacombs.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:10%
This reminds me of
the phrase, nothing

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:10%
is sure as death and taxes.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:10%
The yellow line points
to the Trocadero

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:10%
in the azimuth
equinoctial sunset.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Trocadero marks the beginning
of the white axis running

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:10%
through the Eiffel Tower and
the Ecole Militaire complex.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:10%
The white line connects
Trocadero to the Gate of Hell,

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:10%
but has no astronomical
meaning as far as I can tell.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:10%
The blue line starts
at the obelisk

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:10%
at Place Fontenoy, which
is right on the white axis

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:10%
in front of UNESCO.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
This non-Egyptian
obelisk commemorates

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
a battle that took
place in the year 841,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but the obelisk was
erected here in 1860.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:10%
The blue line is
precisely the azimuth

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:10%
of winter solstice sunset.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you're wondering where
all the colored lines converge.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Their common center is
precisely at the entrance

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
to the Tuileries Garden,
but why is it there?

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Before the revolution,
the Tuileries

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
was a royal palace that closed
off the Louvre Courtyard.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The center point of
the solar alignments

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
lies directly in front of the
entrance to the Royal Palace.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:10%
The palace was destroyed in
the chaos of the revolution,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:10%
but the alignments remain.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Great
Pyramid of Giza,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
the Louvre Pyramid
will yield more secrets

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
upon further analysis.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
The plan of the Louvre Pyramid
and the fountains surrounding

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:90%
it is itself a sacred diagram.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Referred to as the sacred
cut of ad quadratum,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the diagram was traditionally
used as an astrological house

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:90%
chart in centuries past.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Overlaid is the house
chart Johannes Kepler

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
made for General
Wallenstein in 1608.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:10%
Yes, that's the same Kepler
who discovered the three

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:10%
laws of planetary motion
that keep telecommunications

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:10%
satellites in orbit today.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:10%
Astrology is actually
very serious business.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:10%
The Louvre Pyramid
acts as entrance

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:10%
to the world's most
visited museum.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Recall how I overlaid
the Vitruvian Man only

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
after analyzing
the pyramid itself

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:84%
in finding the mark of
the beast encoded within.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The Vitruvian Man's mouth
corresponds appropriately

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with this entrance, so the
next time you enter the Louvre,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:90%
ponder its symbolism.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You are entering the
mouth of the beast.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Look at what is aligned
with this so-called mouth--

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:90%
the Palais Royal.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Central to French
history, the Palais Royal

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
is where many generations
of royals lived.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Louis XIV grew up
there, for example.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The Duke of Orleans
later owned the palace.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I was extremely surprised
to recognize the five

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:84%
by 12 Jerusalem rectangle,
precisely framed

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
in the proportions of the
Royal Palace's court of honor.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.520 align:middle line:10%
The palace garden's
two famous lawns

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.420 align:middle line:10%
symbolize the two holiest spots
in Christianity and Judaism.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:84%
There is clearly a
royal French connection

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient mysteries.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Royal of royals, Louis
XIV's reign of 72 years

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
was longer and
arguably more powerful

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
than any other king
in European history.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Architect of the Vatican's St.
Peter's Square, Gian Lorenzo

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Bernini allegorically
portrayed Louis XIV

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
as Alexander the Great
in the famous equestrian

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
statue located in front
of the Louvre Pyramid.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
This statue marks the
beginning and faces

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of what is called

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:90%
the Axe Historique of Paris.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:10%
The historical axis runs
from the equestrian statue

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:10%
of Louis XIV, under Napoleon's
Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:10%
through the Tuileries,
over the Luxor obelisk,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:10%
under the Arc de Triomphe,
all the way along the Champs

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Elysee to its end point within
the Grand Arch in La Defense.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:10%
French Egyptologist,
Jean-Marcel Humbert,

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:10%
had this to say about
the Axe Historique.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:84%
"I have not verified
this, but it

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is said that the great
axis is a Masonic alignment

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and that this is not
the result of chance.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
It is known that the
Freemasons find their origins

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt."

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:10%
I have verified that the
Axe Historique is, indeed,

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:10%
aligned to the heliacal
rising of Sirius,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:10%
just as is the older Notre
Dame on the Ile de la

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:10%
Cite, whose axis parallels
the Champs Elysee.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Hancock and Bauval traced
the origins of this alignment

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:10%
to the fact that
Notre Dame was likely

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:10%
built over an ancient
Roman temple of Isis.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:10%
Notre Dame, or Our Lady, is
therefore Mary veiling Isis.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps even more amazing,
Hancock and Bauval

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:10%
show the word "Paris" comes
from the melding together

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:10%
of the words, Pharia-Isis.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Pharia, or Pharos in
Greek, is the island

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:10%
where the wondrous
lighthouse of Alexandria was

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:10%
and the center of Isis
worship in antiquity.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Now let's imagine taking in an
enlightening ride with the Sun

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
King along the axis he laid out,
which was greatly embellished

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
with hidden symbolism
by Napoleon, Mitterrand,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and many others on up
to the present day.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
For the first destination,
we must travel underground

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
both under the Earth's surface
and below public consciousness.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
La Pyramide in Versailles is
an underground atrium space

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by
fashionable boutiques.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
The downward facing pyramid
is the symbolic opposite

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:90%
to the famous museum entrance.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:10%
As the upward pointing
pyramid symbolizes a man,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:10%
the inverted pyramid must,
therefore, represent a woman.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, the symbols
for fire and water

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
are upward and downward
facing triangles.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.950 align:middle line:10%
This polarity is
also represented

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:10%
in Western mysticism
as sword and chalice.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:10%
The chalice in question is,
of course, the holy grail.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Going with the holy
blood, holy grail thesis,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
it's fitting that
Dan Brown chose

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to portray the location of
the Tomb of Mary Magdalene

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
right here under the
pyramid in Versailles

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
at the end of "The
Da Vinci Code."

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
If the star of
David is the symbol

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:84%
of the union of male and female,
then the star tetrahedron

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.012 align:middle line:90%
is its 3D equivalent.

00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Drunvalo Melchizedek's
volumes on the ancient secret

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:84%
of the flower of life show
the human energy field,

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
or Mer-Ka-Ba, as
it's known, takes

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
the form of a star
tetrahedron, male and female

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
being inversions of each other.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:10%
On a higher level,
Richard Hoagland

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:10%
has shown how star tetrahedron
geometry is implicated

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:10%
in hyper-dimensional
energy outflows coming

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:10%
from planetary cores
in our solar system.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
When a star tetrahedron is
inscribed within a sphere,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
its points touch the sphere's
surface at 19 and 1/2 degrees

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:90%
north and south latitude.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, one of the
tetrahedral points

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is on the Mauna Loa
volcano in Hawaii,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:84%
which is actually the
largest mountain on Earth

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:90%
if measured from the sea floor.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Similar energy outflows
occur at 19 and 1/2 degrees

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
north or south on Mars'
Olympus Mons, which

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is the largest mountain
in the solar system,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and Jupiter's great red spot,
and Neptune's great dark spot.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Explaining these
outflows requires

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.770 align:middle line:10%
a four-dimensional
model of physics,

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:10%
where energy is gated from
the sun to the planetary cores

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:10%
through hyperspace.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Energy transduced by
each planetary body

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:90%
appears to us as heat in 3D.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Emerging from the most stable
of all three dimensional forms,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:90%
the star tetrahedron.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The simplest way of
describing of physics that's

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
based on the same geometry for
both planetary and human energy

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.140 align:middle line:84%
fields would be as above, so
below, the hermetic motto.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Next on our tour is
the Arc de Triomphe du

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Carrousel built by Napoleon.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
When you stand directly
under the central arch,

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
your body symbolically
resonates with the sun.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:84%
The name, Carrousel, suggests
planets revolving about you.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:10%
The 12 hedges representing
constellations

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:10%
of the zodiac radiate
like rays of the sun

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:10%
from exactly where
you are standing.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the official
allegory of peace being guided

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
by Napoleon's
victories, the chariot

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
drawn by four horses
on top of the arch

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
could just as well be read
as the ancient depiction

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:90%
of Helios drawn by four horses.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The oval that
terminates the hedges

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes Kepler's
scientific discovery

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
that planets have
elliptical orbits,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and the square hedges must be
the two foci of the ellipse.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon was most obviously
interested in correlating

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
the human body with the sun.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Le Notre laid out
the Tuileries Garden

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.500 align:middle line:90%
at the request of the Sun King.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:10%
The garden's
proportions, fountains,

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:10%
and parterre patterns amazingly
fit the Jerusalem rectangle.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:10%
See how the fountains
are tangent to the Xes?

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:10%
The octagonal
fountain, therefore,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:10%
corresponds with the
Dome of the Rock,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:10%
and the round fountain
with the Holy Sepulchre.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:10%
Paris is another new Jerusalem.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
When you train yourself
to see hermetic symbolism,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
it starts appearing all
over Paris in plain sight.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:90%
It can be a bit overwhelming.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Two equestrian statues flank
the entrance to the Tuileries

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
from the Place de la Concorde.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:10%
Her exposed breasts suggest
this goddess might be Isis.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The other rider is Mercury
holding the staff of Osiris,

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:84%
or caduceus, which
has become the symbol

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
of the medical profession.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Here's another possible Isis in
the garden and another Mercury.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
This golden boy is
the genie of Paris

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
atop the July
Column commemorating

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the Revolution of 1830.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:90%
The genie is Mercury himself.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The first time
hermetic symbolism

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:84%
had come completely out
into the open in France

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
was during the 1789 revolution.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Declaration
of the Rights

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of Man depicting the all-seeing
eye of the supreme being.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:10%
Incidentally, this
design was influenced

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:10%
by Benjamin Franklin,
who is something

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:10%
of a Freemasonic celebrity
in Paris at the time.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:10%
Franklin helped
design the great seal

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:10%
of the United States, which
bears the same all-seeing eye.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:10%
In time for the celebration of
the heliacal rising of Sirius

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:10%
in 1793, this fountain was
erected in the Place de la

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:10%
Bastille.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:10%
The famous artist,
Jacques-Louis David,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:10%
sculpted the Fountain
of Regeneration

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:10%
with Isis even wearing
an Egyptian headdress.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:10%
The water streaming
out of her breasts

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:10%
recalls the image of Saint
Bernard de Clairvaux receiving

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:10%
milk from the Virgin.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And how can we
forget this view--

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the Eiffel Tower as
phallus of Osiris

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
with the Statue of Liberty
replica on the Seine

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:90%
as his sister bride?

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:10%
The largest square in Paris
is up next on the Isis axis.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:10%
Believe it or not, La
Place de la Concorde

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:10%
has an area of precisely
86,400 square meters.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Remember the 864-foot
high Transamerica Pyramid

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.242 align:middle line:10%
and the 864,000 feet from
Stonehenge to Silbury Hill?

00:24:28.242 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:84%
You see, it doesn't
matter if we're

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
talking metric or imperial units
with shifted decimal places.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:90%
What matters are the numbers.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact is the sun's
diameter is 864,000 miles,

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and there are 86,400
seconds in a mean solar day.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:10%
The area of the Place thus
confirms it as a solar symbol.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:10%
The cars are likened
to planets wandering

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.370 align:middle line:10%
around the elliptical
traffic circle.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:10%
The twin fountains symbolize
the watery galactic midplane

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:10%
of the Milky Way, just as they
do in front of the Vatican.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:84%
That makes the Champs
Elysee the ecliptic.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Le Notre designed La Place
de l'Etoile, where the Arc de

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Triomphe stands today.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Standing at the center
of the place of the star,

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
the ceremonial arch is read
literally as a stargate.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:10%
12 streets radiating
outward represent a zodiac.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The triumphal arch
originally honored

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
the warriors who fought for
France in the Napoleonic Wars,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and it later became the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The eternal flame
under the arch might

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:90%
be another solar reference.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:10%
There is certainly a lot of
sun worship going on in Paris.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon invaded
Egypt in 1798, and not

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
even counting the Egyptians,
the French death toll

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:90%
came to more than 20,000 souls.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
After France's great
defeat, Napoleon

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
was asked why he decided in the
first place to invade Egypt.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I came to draw
attention and bring back

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the interest of Europe to the
center of the ancient world."

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
While the campaign was raging,
Napoleon spent a night alone

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid, and when
asked about his experience,

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
he supposedly said,
"You wouldn't believe me

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:90%
if I told you."

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Moving on toward the
strange attractor

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
axis, we finally

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
conclude our journey
through space and time

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.790 align:middle line:90%
at Le Grande Arche.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:10%
Contemporaneous with the
Louvre Pyramid, the Grand Arch

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:10%
was also built at the request
of President Mitterrand.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
This time, Mitterrand held a
national design competition,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
but personally selected
architect, Johann Otto von

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Spreckelsen in the end anyway.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, Spreckelsen
died before the project

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:90%
was completed.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The location of the Grand Arch
has a special relationship

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
to the Arc de Triomphe, the
Luxor obelisk, and the Arc de

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Triomphe du Carrousel.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:10%
All four monuments are
spaced in such a way

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:10%
to create this approximate
doubling pattern,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:10%
suggesting musical octaves.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:10%
In addition, the Arc de Triomphe
is roughly double the size

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:10%
of the Arc de
Triomphe du Carrousel,

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:10%
and the Grand Arch is about
double the size of the Arc de

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:10%
Triomphe.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:10%
In the scaling of
these three arches,

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:10%
I see three stargates
representing

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:10%
the human, planetary,
and stellar bodies,

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:10%
just as we saw symbolized
with cubes in London and DC.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Notre Dame Cathedral
fits perfectly

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:90%
inside the Grand Arch.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing this
is no accident.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:10%
A tune in three
octaves, if you will,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:10%
I call it the symphony
of the stargates.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:10%
The dimensions of the
monumental structure

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:10%
are cubic with edge length
measuring approximately

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:53.740 align:middle line:10%
110 meters, or 360 feet.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Researcher Jim Allison
realized that 360 feet is also

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:10%
precisely equal to 210
Egyptian royal cubits,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:10%
and I see that the office
windows inside the arch

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:10%
are arranged in groups
of 210, providing

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:10%
validation of this metrology.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The exterior side's symbolic
measure depicts 22 over seven

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.730 align:middle line:90%
in meters.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:10%
22 over seven is, of course,
an approximation of pi.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
12 columns internally
support the structure,

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and a zodiac is literally
depicted in the basement floor,

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
making the arch yet another
form of sun worship.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The sides of the
monumental arch actually

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
contain some 40,000 square
meters of office space.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Multi-purpose rooms in
the basement measure

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:90%
400 square meters each.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:90%
These numbers got me thinking.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:84%
40,000 and 400 are very
interesting numbers.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
To appreciate this, let's
start with the metric system.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The metric system was originally
defined by measuring the Earth.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The original prime meridian
passed through the Paris

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Observatory and continued
all the way around the Earth.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:10%
This circumference was
defined as 40,000 kilometers

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.030 align:middle line:10%
in the 18th century,
and this served

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:10%
to define the metric system.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
There are 121 documented
bronze medallions marked Arago

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:84%
after the French
astronomer embedded

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:84%
in streets and sidewalks
in a line crossing Paris.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:10%
These medallions marked the
line of the Paris prime meridian

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:10%
that was used in
France for 200 years.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:10%
This line touches the corner of
one of the Louvre's satellite

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:10%
pyramids.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, this is why the
smaller pyramids are there.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:10%
The meter is the basic unit
of length in science today.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:10%
The meter's definition move from
being based in earth measure

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:10%
to a prototype bar to
being circularly defined

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the speed of
light, which is itself measured

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:10%
in meters per second.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Knight and
Alan Butler's book,

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
"Who Built the Moon?"
is really an eye opener.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Although I don't agree
with their thesis

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:10%
that the moon is an
artificial satellite,

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:10%
they have discovered numbers
relating sun, moon, and Earth

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.860 align:middle line:10%
that are too perfect to be
the product of random chance.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:10%
For example, consider
a solar eclipse.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.770 align:middle line:10%
When one happens, the moon
completely covers the sun disk.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:10%
The only reason
this can occur so

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:10%
precisely is because the moon
is exactly 400 times smaller

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:10%
than the sun and happens to be
400 times closer than the sun

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:10%
during the eclipse.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
The Earth also turns 400
times faster than the moon.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:10%
The odds of these three
seemingly unrelated

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.470 align:middle line:10%
characteristics would all
converge on the number 400

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:10%
is literally astronomical.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:10%


00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:10%
As I already mentioned,
the Axe Historique

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:10%
is aligned with the
heliacal rising of Sirius,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.930 align:middle line:10%
known as the Star of Isis.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:10%
But the Grand Arch is turned
approximately six degrees

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:10%
with respect to this axis.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:90%
This is, of course, no accident.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a purpose.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the
mind-boggling planning that

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:90%
went into the Grand Arch alone?

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Groundbreaking
architectural design

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that ties together layer upon
layer of hidden symbolism

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.965 align:middle line:84%
completing the hermetic
masterpiece that is Paris.

00:31:16.965 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Jim Allison has found what
the Grand Arch is pointing to.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready for this?

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It points to the birthplace
of Isis in Dendera, Egypt.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:84%
This tiny unassuming temple out
in back of the larger Hathor

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Temple is known as the
traditional birthplace of Isis.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
The location of the small cube
within the larger enclosure

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
matches the azimuth where
the Grand Arch is facing.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:10%
Remember that the
heliacal rising of Sirius

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:10%
was the basis of the
ancient Egyptian calendar.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, here is where
all that started.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.980 align:middle line:84%
This is where ancient
Egyptian priests

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
saw her bright star rising
just before the dawn,

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:84%
signaling the beginning
of a new year.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:10%
Isn't it amazing that the
Champs Elysee and Pennsylvania

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.220 align:middle line:10%
Avenue share the same
astronomical orientation

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.740 align:middle line:10%
with this tiny backwater
in modern Egypt?

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Backwater it may be today,
but symbolically, it's

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:84%
the holiest place
in the cult of Isis.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon came here
and had a master Mason

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
cut out this massive ceiling
from the adjacent temple

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and ship it back to Paris.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Dendera
Zodiac and is now

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.240 align:middle line:90%
suspended in the Louvre.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:10%
As you can see,
the Dendera Zodiac

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:10%
has octagram star symmetry.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.380 align:middle line:84%
More than a zodiac,
it is a planisphere

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
showing the whole cosmology
as seen through Egyptian eyes.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Another Louvre ceiling that
gets to the essence of things

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:10%
is Francois-Edouard Picot's
Study and Genius Reveal Ancient

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:10%
Egypt and Greece.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Hancock and Bauval
recognized the importance

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of this hermetic work in
their book, "Talisman."

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The painting allows
the viewer to see

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Isis unveiled for Athena.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:10%
This unveiling references
Plutarch's first century

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:10%
depiction of her temple at
Sais, where it was inscribed,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.240 align:middle line:10%
"I am all that has been
and is and shall be.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
My veil no mortal
hath ever raised."

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:10%
The term "genius" in
the title is the epithet

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:10%
of the divine
messenger, Mercury, who

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:10%
is introducing Athena to Isis.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I think the Western world
exemplified by Athena

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:84%
is being introduced to the
older stream of knowledge

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.370 align:middle line:90%
coming out of Egypt.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
As I can attest, the
term "study" in the title

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:84%
refers to the intensive
research required

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
to uncover the deep Egyptian
connections that the elite is

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:90%
so clearly obsessed with.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Returning to Paris, let's
look at the Grand Arch

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:90%
with fresh eyes.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember that
everything has a reason.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Arch is in La Defense,
the modern section of Paris.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
We need a modern
mathematical understanding

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
to perceive its deepest
symbol and to recognize it

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.739 align:middle line:84%
for what it truly is-- a
three-dimensional shadow

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
of a hypercube.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Come again?

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.000 align:middle line:90%
What is a hypercube?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:10%
If the square is
2D, the cube is 3D,

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:10%
and the hypercube is
the 4D equivalent.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:84%
Here's what a cube looks
like when it's being rotated.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's what rotating
a hypercube looks

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
like in three-dimensional
projection.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.639 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
is hard to imagine,

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:40.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's
literally beyond us.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
You might be interested to learn
that four spatial dimensions

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
were known far before the
birth of modern science.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Here is what Saint
Bernard de Clairvaux

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:55.070 align:middle line:10%
wrote to his former disciple,
who became Pope Eugene III.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:90%
"What is God?

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.010 align:middle line:84%
He is length, width,
height, and depth."

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
There are four
spatial terms used.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Bernard described the fourth
dimension in the 12th century.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Saint Paul also
described four dimensions

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.460 align:middle line:90%
in the first century.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:10%
"That Christ may
dwell in your hearts

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:10%
by faith, that ye being
rooted and grounded in love

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:10%
may be able to comprehend with
all saints what is the breadth

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and length and depth and height,
and to know the love of Christ,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:10%
which passeth knowledge
that ye may be filled

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:10%
with all the fullness of God."

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Four centuries
before Paul, Plato

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.940 align:middle line:84%
even described higher
dimensional reality

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
in his allegory of the cave,
which goes something like this.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
"We are prisoners
chained in a cave

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:90%
and sit facing a blank wall.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a fire
outside the cave,

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and unseen people are
passing in front of it.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We see shadows on
the wall and mistake

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:90%
this illusion for reality."

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I think we are kept in the
dark about a great many things.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the hypercube
shadow in 3D projection looks

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:90%
like a cube within a cube.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:84%
This structure is fractal,
meaning the same pattern

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:90%
repeats at different scales.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We've seen things like this
before in cities, buildings,

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.790 align:middle line:90%
and art.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Consider the fractal-like
city of London within greater

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.880 align:middle line:84%
London, Vatican
City within Rome,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and the United
Nations headquarters

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:90%
within New York City.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:84%
On the scale of a
building, take a look

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.950 align:middle line:84%
at the Dome of
the Chain standing

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:30.630 align:middle line:84%
immediately outside
the Dome of the Rock.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the same structure repeated
in a smaller scale, hinting

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:84%
at a higher dimensional
connection for those who have

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:90%
eyes to read the symbolism.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:10%
Examples from art
are Pomodoro's series

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:10%
of golden spheres within
spheres scattered strategically

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:10%
in the Vatican, UN
headquarters, museums in DC,

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:10%
and San Francisco.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The sacred Egyptian
cubit is a unit

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:84%
of measure reserved for
measuring the Earth.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
One sacred cubit is
equal to 6 over 5

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
raised to the fourth
power in English feet.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Raising to the fourth power
means the sacred cubit

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:90%
is literally a hypercubit.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Michele and Heath
have found there

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
are 10 million hypercubits
in the Earth's polar radius

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and 63 million hypercubits in
its meridian circumference.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:10%
Now these amazingly round
numbers measure our planet

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:10%
with remarkable accuracy.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:10%
How can this be?

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:10%
Some physicists
believe the universe

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:10%
is made of 10 dimensional
superstrings, but six of them

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:10%
have curled up into
unimaginably small size.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:10%
The four remaining dimensions
express the architecture

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:10%
Recall how I saw in the
union of both Louvre pyramids

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.320 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge of
how energy flows

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.110 align:middle line:10%
from the sun through hyperspace
into planetary bodies.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the
Earth is measured

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
by a hypercubit, whose
edge length of 6 over 5

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:90%
relates macrocosm to microcosm.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is therefore a
hyper-dimensional object,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:84%
even though with our
normal perception,

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
we experience both the Earth and
ourselves as being only three

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:90%
dimensional.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Another projection of the
hypercube into two dimensions

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
looks like this.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the
octagram star within?

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:90%
This is where it all comes from.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.340 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a hypercube.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Recall Metatron's cube.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the Grand Arch,

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:84%
we perceive Metatron's cube
as Metatron's hypercube.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:10%
This 4D solar
symbol appropriately

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:10%
contains the 3D star tetrahedron
and the 2D star of David.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.910 align:middle line:10%
We see now why these
sacred diagrams are both

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:10%
called stars-- because they are
projections of our sun, which

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:10%
is itself a star.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:10%
To make all of this
four-dimensional geometry

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:10%
easier to understand, it helps
to bring it down a level.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:10%
When folding a squared
gives you a line,

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:10%
unfolding a cardboard
cube gives you a cross.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Unfolding a hypercube gives
you a cross made of cubes.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:10%
Salvador Dali started
with this idea

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:10%
when he painted the
Corpus Hypercubus.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:10%
He depicts the crucifixion, yes,
but what is he really saying?

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.010 align:middle line:10%
Corpus Hypercubus is the
ascended body as hypercube.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:84%
In Analytic Cubism,
the art movement

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that anticipated
Dali's surrealism,

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Picasso and Braque
depicted objects

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.690 align:middle line:84%
from a multitude of
viewpoints in an effort

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:90%
to see all sides at once.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Of all the myriad
forms in existence,

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.240 align:middle line:84%
why did they choose a cube to
symbolize their art movement?

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Could these cubists have been
privy to secret knowledge that

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:84%
inspired their attempt to
paint the fourth dimension,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.620 align:middle line:84%
or did they follow unconscious
synchromystic inspiration?

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Food for thought.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
human body, the Earth,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and the sun symbolized as
hypercubes, three cubes

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.280 align:middle line:90%
if you want to use a 3D symbol.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.680 align:middle line:90%
So which is it?

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.686 align:middle line:90%
It's actually all of the above.

00:40:09.686 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
The human, planetary,
and stellar scales

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:84%
resonate as a fractal
structure within

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:90%
the holographic universe.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:84%
In simpler terms,
as above, so below.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's hypercube,
as Enoch's hypercube,

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:90%
reveals the cosmic man.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Enoch's triangle had
the ineffable name

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:90%
of God written on it.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Here is that name
in Hebrew, which

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is a language read
from right to left.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:10%
Standing the letters
up, we see the depiction

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.760 align:middle line:10%
of a man made in God's image.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.810 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic man is Plato's world
soul, alchemy's Anima Mundi,

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.638 align:middle line:90%
and the Kabbalah's Adam Kadmon.

00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Here is a piece of my own
artwork showing Adam Kadmon

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:90%
emerging from the tree of life.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
If the human body is a
temple, then this temple

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is much more vast
and interconnected

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:90%
than we ever imagined.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.920 align:middle line:84%
The human energy form resonates
with the esoteric architecture

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:84%
What we know as the
history of civilization

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.080 align:middle line:84%
is only a very small
part of our past.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:10%
There is something extraordinary
about our beginnings not

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:10%
written about in history books.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:10%
The oldest surviving temples
encode an understanding

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.630 align:middle line:10%
of Earth, moon, and sun
that is, in some ways,

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:10%
more advanced than
modern science.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.970 align:middle line:84%
To catch up with
ancient knowledge,

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:84%
a broad interdisciplinary
approach is clearly indicated.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Specialists in art history,
archeology, architecture,

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.990 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, semiotics,
mathematics, physics,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and many others will need
to cooperate in new ways.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:10%
By seriously studying Stonehenge
and the Great Pyramid,

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:10%
we've seen how people living
at the dawn of civilization

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:10%
possessed the
ability to accurately

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.350 align:middle line:10%
measure the size of
the Earth and to survey

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:10%
long distances with a precision
rivaling GPS satellites.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Logically, our
civilization must therefore

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.720 align:middle line:84%
be a legacy from an
earlier civilization.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:10%
Whether this was Atlantis and/or
an off-world civilization,

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.150 align:middle line:10%
I cannot presently
say with certainty.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The rediscovery
of the importance

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of number, geometry,
music, and astronomy

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:84%
should rekindle interest in
ancient Egyptian knowledge

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:84%
passed down to us
by philosophers,

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:90%
such as Pythagoras and Plato.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Understanding how the macrocosm
and microcosm are related

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:84%
through the art
of sacred geometry

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and the act of
measuring structures

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth is a thing
of profound beauty.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:10%
Relating sixes to fives by
drawing hexagons and pentagons

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.790 align:middle line:10%
in the landscape or by
measuring with Egyptian units

00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:10%
are brilliant examples of
this ancient science at work.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:10%
Finding Pythagorean
triangles, five

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:10%
by 12 rectangles, pyramids,
octagrams, enneagrams,

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and zodiacs encoded in much of
the world's great architecture

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.530 align:middle line:10%
and urban design
exposes an obsession

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:10%
with ancient symbolism
spanning the centuries.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.290 align:middle line:84%
The designers take
this symbolism

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:84%
so seriously that
there must really

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:90%
be power in ancient knowledge.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Putting this story
together has been

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:84%
by far the most challenging
and satisfying project

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.190 align:middle line:90%
of my professional life.

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've enjoyed it, and
I invite your participation

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in uncovering more
secrets in plain sight.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.330 align:middle line:84%
This is Scott Onstott,
and I thank you

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.590 align:middle line:90%
for sharing my journey.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:90%
