00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.329
<v Voiceover>Jerusalem is one of the</v>

2
00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:13.068
oldest cities in the world,

3
00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:14.938
having been continuously inhabited

4
00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:17.411
for close to six millennia.

5
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:19.672
The old walled city that occupies an area

6
00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.994
of less than one square kilometer,

7
00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:26.994
is sacred in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

8
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.754
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre

9
00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:31.516
is the most sacred place in Christianity

10
00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:34.655
where Jesus was both crucified and entombed

11
00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.036
before rising from the dead.

12
00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.155
The site where Solomon's and Herod's temples were located

13
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.175
is actively debated.

14
00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.835
The only thing the researchers seem to agree upon

15
00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.637
is that it was somewhere on the Temple Mount.

16
00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:52.117
Locating the temple precisely is a priority for Jews

17
00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:53.720
because the Rock of Foundation

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.200
within the temple's Holy of Holies

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.099
is the most sacred place in Judaism.

20
00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:02.599
For centuries, it has been assumed that this rock

21
00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:07.085
is the same stone whereupon Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac

22
00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.665
and from which Mohammed ascended into heaven.

23
00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:13.427 line:15% 
Namely the bedrock upon which the Dome of the Rock

24
00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.147 line:15% 
stands today.

25
00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:16.627 line:15% 
You can see in this cutaway

26
00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:21.627 line:15% 
how this Sufi shrine was built to worship this bedrock.

27
00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:26.789 line:15% 
My favorite theory comes from Dr. Ashur Kaufman in 1991.

28
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.109
He claims that the Jewish Foundation Stone

29
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.248
is located just north of the Dome of the Rock

30
00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:34.769
in a small section of exposed bedrock

31
00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:38.530 line:15% 
currently under the diminutive Dome of the Tablets.

32
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.092 line:15% 
The echo of tablets in the Dome's name

33
00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:43.293 line:15% 
is actually circumstantial evidence

34
00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:45.381 line:15% 
suggesting correlation with the tablets

35
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.636 line:15% 
of the Ten Commandments.

36
00:01:47.636 --> 00:01:49.137 line:15% 
These most famous tablets

37
00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:51.840 line:15% 
were stored in the Ark of the Covenant,

38
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.842 line:15% 
which of course was located within the Holy of Holies

39
00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:58.521
within Solomon's temple.

40
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.322 line:15% 
However, the main reason I subscribed to this theory

41
00:02:01.322 --> 00:02:04.344 line:15% 
is that it fits the larger geometry of the city

42
00:02:04.344 --> 00:02:07.404 line:15% 
as proposed by John Michell and Christine Rhone

43
00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:10.564 line:15% 
in their book, Twelve-Tribe Nations.

44
00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:13.565
Michell and Rhone have drawn a five-by-twelve rectangle

45
00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:15.065
over Jerusalem,

46
00:02:15.065 --> 00:02:16.805
matching the proportion of rectangles

47
00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:19.205
we've studied all over the world.

48
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.024
The Jerusalem rectangle is anchored

49
00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.145
in the ancient Jaffa Gate

50
00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.585
and opposite city wall corner point here.

51
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:31.165
Its right edge parallels the Temple Mount.

52
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.665
Richard Heath showed in Sacred Number,

53
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.426
that when we draw equal x's

54
00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.166
within the rectangle,

55
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.866
the crossing points pass directly over the Rock of Calvary,

56
00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.406
inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre

57
00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:45.506
where Jesus was crucified

58
00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:47.986 line:15% 
and over the Jewish Rock of Foundation

59
00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:50.366 line:15% 
under the Dome of the Tablets.

60
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:51.986 line:15% 
In other words, these x's

61
00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:54.186 line:15% 
precisely mark the holiest spots

62
00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:58.212 line:15% 
in Christianity and Judaism.

63
00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:01.312 line:15% 
Measuring the rectangle uncovers something more.

64
00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:06.312 line:15% 
The length is equal to 1,728 cubits of 1.728 feet each.

65
00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:10.564 line:15% 
That's a double reference to the number

66
00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:15.564 line:15% 
we learned in Washington, DC, symbolizes a cube.

67
00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:19.446 line:15% 
In Judaism, the Holy of Holies within Solomon's Temple

68
00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:21.606 line:15% 
had very specific proportions

69
00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.706 line:15% 
as described in the Torah.

70
00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:28.526 line:15% 
It was a cube measuring 20 cubits on each side.

71
00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:31.446
The holiest spot in Islam is Mecca.

72
00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:34.535 line:15% 
More specifically, it is the Kaaba within Mecca,

73
00:03:34.535 --> 00:03:36.535
which all Muslims are supposed to visit

74
00:03:36.535 --> 00:03:38.775
at least once in their lives.

75
00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:40.695
Kaaba means cube.

76
00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:45.695
Indeed the object of their veneration is a giant black cube.

77
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.416
The word, Kabbalah, which means knowledge

78
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:50.256
in Jewish Mysticism,

79
00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:53.676
also references a cube.

80
00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.057
In Greek mythology,

81
00:03:55.057 --> 00:03:59.017
Apollo and Artemis were born on the small island of Delos.

82
00:03:59.017 --> 00:04:01.418
As the story goes, the citizens of Delos

83
00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:03.683 line:15% 
consulted the Oracle at Delphi

84
00:04:03.683 --> 00:04:07.231 line:15% 
to learn how to defeat a plague sent by Apollo.

85
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.907 line:15% 
The Oracle responded that they must

86
00:04:08.907 --> 00:04:12.795
double the volume of their cubic altar to Apollo.

87
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:16.723
This rather difficult problem involving the cube root of two

88
00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.136
was known as the Delian problem in mathematics,

89
00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:21.456
which was later solved

90
00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:25.397
by the Pythagorean philosopher, Archytas.

91
00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:27.897
Why are so many of the most important places

92
00:04:27.897 --> 00:04:30.957
symbolized by cubes?

93
00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:33.640 line:15% 
Recall that the cubit that measures Jerusalem

94
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.404 line:15% 
is 1.728 English feet exactly.

95
00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:39.785
1.728 is equal to

96
00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:41.226
six over five

97
00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:43.426
raised to the third power.

98
00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:47.086
I suggest you do the math to verify this is so.

99
00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.066
Come to think of it, the word cubit

100
00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:52.566
clearly comes from the word cube.

101
00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:56.486
So Jerusalem is symbolized by the volume of a cube,

102
00:04:56.486 --> 00:05:01.451 line:15% 
whose edge length relates macrocosm to microcosm.

103
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:04.552
If you dimension the Jerusalem rectangle in this way,

104
00:05:04.552 --> 00:05:07.412
with two depictions of six and five,

105
00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:09.232
you'll see the x's themselves

106
00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:12.953
as representations of the great enigma of alchemy,

107
00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:16.813
namely the relationship between six and five.

108
00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:18.834
Perhaps not surprisingly,

109
00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:22.634
the cubit that measures 1.728 English feet,

110
00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:26.154
is actually the canonical Egyptian cubit.

111
00:05:26.154 --> 00:05:29.214 line:15% 
Author Ahmed Osman puts forward the controversial

112
00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:30.978 line:15% 
but never refuted theory,

113
00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:35.320 line:15% 
that Moses was actually the Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten.

114
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.320 line:15% 
Both were powerful monotheists who were educated in Egypt.

115
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.240 line:15% 
It's certainly a theory worth contemplating.

116
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.540 line:15% 
Many of the most significant events in Jesus's life

117
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.920 line:15% 
are lined up along an axis.

118
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.260 line:15% 
First of all, Jesus spent time teaching his disciples

119
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.762 line:15% 
on the Mount of Olives.

120
00:05:56.762 --> 00:05:59.442
Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday

121
00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:02.885
through this oldest of gates in Jerusalem city walls,

122
00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:06.085
called the Golden Gate in Christian tradition.

123
00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:10.365
I can't help but think of the bridge in San Francisco.

124
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:13.169
Here's Giotto's depiction of Mary's parents,

125
00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.169
Joachim and Anne, meeting at The Golden Gate.

126
00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.349
In Jewish tradition, this same gate

127
00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.390
is the one through which the Messiah will enter Jerusalem

128
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.849
at some unknown point in the future.

129
00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.892
However, Suleiman the Magnificent

130
00:06:27.892 --> 00:06:30.964
sealed off the Golden Gate in 1541,

131
00:06:30.964 --> 00:06:33.684
literally to prevent the Messiah's entrance

132
00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.404
and the Golden Gate and Temple Mount

133
00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:38.224
remain under Islamic control today.

134
00:06:38.224 --> 00:06:40.945
As you know, this tension between Muslims and Jews

135
00:06:40.945 --> 00:06:44.325
has persisted up to the present day.

136
00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:46.387
Jesus upset the moneychangers' tables

137
00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:48.566
in Herod's temple here,

138
00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:50.397
if we accept the Kaufman theory

139
00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:54.420
as to the location of the Second Temple.

140
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.181
The Garden of Gethsemane

141
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.642
is the place where Jesus prayed

142
00:06:57.642 --> 00:07:00.402
the night before his crucifixion.

143
00:07:00.402 --> 00:07:02.722
This is the place where he is said to have sweat

144
00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.382
drops of blood.

145
00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:08.003 line:15% 
As tradition has it, the crucifixion happened at Calvary,

146
00:07:08.003 --> 00:07:11.264 line:15% 
and his body was placed in the Holy Sepulchre,

147
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.564 line:15% 
just a few dozen feet away.

148
00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:15.564
Isn't it amazing

149
00:07:15.564 --> 00:07:18.304
that most of the important events in Christianity

150
00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.084
took place along an axis

151
00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:25.084
connecting the center of the x's in this diagram.

152
00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.805
Before we leave Jerusalem,

153
00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:28.707
I want to detour to a place you would

154
00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:31.127
probably never expect me to go.

155
00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:32.852
Winnipeg, Canada.

156
00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.953
It's the capital of Manitoba, eh?

157
00:07:35.953 --> 00:07:38.672
Architectural historian Frank Albo

158
00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:41.512
has discovered the Manitoba Legislative Building

159
00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:44.993
is not only a reconstruction of Solomon's Temple,

160
00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:48.213
but is loaded with secrets in plain sight.

161
00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:50.401 line:15% 
The architect Frank Worthington Simon

162
00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:52.446 line:15% 
designed this 1920 building

163
00:07:52.446 --> 00:07:55.870 line:15% 
to be veiled in allegory and illustrated with symbols

164
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.191
only his Freemasonic brothers would understand.

165
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:02.610
In fact, every premier who worked in this building

166
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:07.610
from 1870 to 1967, was a Freemason.

167
00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:11.271
Two Egyptian sphinxes flank the entrance

168
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.513
just as they do in front of the House of the Temple

169
00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:16.573 line:15% 
in Washington, DC.

170
00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:19.334
The top of the dome features a thirteen foot high

171
00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:21.534
gilded statue of Mercury,

172
00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:25.614 line:15% 
the same golden boy we'll meet again in Paris.

173
00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:28.614
After going up two flights of thirteen steps,

174
00:08:28.614 --> 00:08:33.614
one enters a cubic space measuring 66.6 feet on edge.

175
00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:37.234
We'll uncover the unexpected meaning of 666

176
00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:40.035
in the most surprising of places in Paris.

177
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.515
It's probably not what you think.

178
00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:45.375
According to Albo's research,

179
00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:48.064
two, thirteen foot high, bronze bisons

180
00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:53.064
identify this as a cleansing room in temple vernacular.

181
00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:56.213
Going up another flight of thirteen steps,

182
00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:59.140
one arrives in the Rotunda.

183
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.320
There's a mural on the wall of the Rotunda

184
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.860
above the entrance to the Manitoba Legislative Assembly,

185
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.601
that extensively depicts World War I.

186
00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:09.661
However, a man wearing a white robe,

187
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:13.361
with exposed chest, being supported by his brother,

188
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:15.302
identifies him as an initiate

189
00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:18.104
in the first Masonic degree ceremony.

190
00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:21.024 line:15% 
Albo identifies this mural as the altar

191
00:09:21.024 --> 00:09:25.344 line:15% 
in what is secretly an initiation chamber.

192
00:09:25.344 --> 00:09:26.964
Looking up in the rotunda,

193
00:09:26.964 --> 00:09:29.204
you see the underside of the central dome

194
00:09:29.204 --> 00:09:31.465
the golden boy is perched upon.

195
00:09:31.465 --> 00:09:32.725
And looking down a level

196
00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:34.645
through an oculus in the floor,

197
00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:36.846
reveals a fascinating space called the

198
00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:40.269
Pool of the Black Star.

199
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:41.512 line:15% 
Just off the Rotunda,

200
00:09:41.512 --> 00:09:44.215 line:15% 
is the Lt. Governor's Reception Suite,

201
00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:45.956 line:15% 
which is the only space in the building

202
00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:48.056 line:15% 
off limits to the public.

203
00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:51.136 line:15% 
Albo got special permission to measure the chamber

204
00:09:51.136 --> 00:09:52.856 line:15% 
and discovered it's a cube

205
00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:56.037 line:15% 
having and edge length of 20 cubits.

206
00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:58.057
These are precisely the same dimensions

207
00:09:58.057 --> 00:10:01.317
as the Holy of Holies within Solomon's temple.

208
00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:06.216
A place that was also obviously off limits to the public.

209
00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:08.416 line:15% 
But if this represents the Holy of Holies

210
00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:10.297 line:15% 
within Solomon's Temple,

211
00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.317 line:15% 
where is the Ark of the Covenant?

212
00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:15.038 line:15% 
Albo discovered it's directly above this suite

213
00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:17.098 line:15% 
on the building exterior.

214
00:10:17.098 --> 00:10:20.839 line:15% 
The War Chest, as it's known, if flanked by two warriors,

215
00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:23.079 line:15% 
which one can accurately identify

216
00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:27.069 line:15% 
as raiders of the lost Ark.

217
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:29.289
This building is clearly amazing,

218
00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:31.029
but why is it here?

219
00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:34.488
Albo points out that Winnipeg is the geographical center

220
00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:36.069
of North America.

221
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:39.470
The Black Star at the heart of the Legislative Building,

222
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.251
was deliberately placed upon this navel point.

223
00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:46.331
Okay, but what is the building really doing?

224
00:10:46.331 --> 00:10:48.671
I think the Manitoba Legislative Building

225
00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:52.272
was designed as a magical talisman, to harvest,

226
00:10:52.272 --> 00:10:56.972
or in some sense control, the energies of North America.

227
00:10:56.972 --> 00:10:58.732
Consider a much older example

228
00:10:58.732 --> 00:11:01.532
of this type of talismanic magic.

229
00:11:01.532 --> 00:11:03.313
Old Sarum, which is the center point

230
00:11:03.313 --> 00:11:04.993
of ley lines in England,

231
00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:07.414
dates from the same era as Stonehenge,

232
00:11:07.414 --> 00:11:10.274
Avebury and Silbury hill.

233
00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:12.634
This radiating topology reminds me of

234
00:11:12.634 --> 00:11:14.794
one other magical artifact.

235
00:11:14.794 --> 00:11:16.457
The sun disk worshiped during the

236
00:11:16.457 --> 00:11:21.457
reign of King Tut's father, the Pharaoh Akhenaten.

237
00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.558
If you think believing in magic is childish,

238
00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:29.218
consider Walt Disney's so-called Magic Kingdom.

239
00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:33.118
Did you know Disneyland has a mysterious Club 33,

240
00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:35.958
which is not open to the general public?

241
00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.418
We know from studying DC

242
00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:41.119
how important the number 33 is to Masons.

243
00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:44.800
Club 33 memberships cost $20,000,

244
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.700
and it's the only place in Disneyland

245
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.800
where alcohol is served.

246
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.320
There's clearly more going on in the Magic Kingdom

247
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.280
than meets the eye.

248
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.440
I think the Black Star at the center of North America

249
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.580
holds a much deeper secret.

250
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.545 line:15% 
Physicist Nassim Haramein,

251
00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:03.746 line:15% 
whom you'll hear more about in Rome,

252
00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:06.885
believes that Moses took a compact power source

253
00:12:06.885 --> 00:12:08.625
out of the Great Pyramid,

254
00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:10.985
and placed it inside the Ark of the Covenant

255
00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:13.824
before he left Egypt.

256
00:12:13.824 --> 00:12:16.125 line:15% 
Haramein showed how the Ark fits precisely

257
00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:19.745 line:15% 
within the misnamed sarcophagus inside the king's chamber,

258
00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:21.746
within the Great Pyramid.

259
00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:24.785
It was misnamed because no mummy has ever been found

260
00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:27.606
in an Egyptian pyramid.

261
00:12:27.606 --> 00:12:30.656
By the way, the granite box's exterior volume

262
00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:33.676
is exactly double its interior volume,

263
00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:37.256
a mathematical relationship echoed thousands of years later

264
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:41.324
in the Delian problem that plagued the Greeks.

265
00:12:41.324 --> 00:12:42.764
Considering the evidence,

266
00:12:42.764 --> 00:12:45.044
I think the Ark was an Egyptian artifact

267
00:12:45.044 --> 00:12:49.644
before it became the most sacred object in Judaism.

268
00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:52.416 line:15% 
In any case, Haramein believes the power source

269
00:12:52.416 --> 00:12:53.418 line:15% 
inside the Ark

270
00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:56.299 line:15% 
was a mini black hole.

271
00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:58.339
During their exodus from Egypt,

272
00:12:58.339 --> 00:12:59.839
the Bible says the Israelites

273
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:02.220
followed a pillar of cloud by day

274
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.600
and a pillar of fire by night.

275
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.848 line:15% 
Haramein claims the mini black holes stored in the Ark

276
00:13:07.848 --> 00:13:10.535 line:15% 
would have produced just such a fiery vortex

277
00:13:10.535 --> 00:13:14.795 line:15% 
rising like a pillar.

278
00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:18.226 line:15% 
Haramein's physics show that stars are really black holes

279
00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:20.806 line:15% 
under a mantle of trapped matter.

280
00:13:20.806 --> 00:13:22.041 line:15% 
Sun spots are black

281
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:24.922 line:15% 
because they literally are vortices in the mantle

282
00:13:24.922 --> 00:13:29.722 line:15% 
that expose the black hole inside the sun.

283
00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:31.261
The pool of the black star

284
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:33.461
reveals this great cosmic secret

285
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:38.461
to those who can decode the secrets in plain site.

286
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:41.301
Perhaps there is no where else in the world

287
00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:43.921
with more layers of history and symbolism

288
00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:45.921
than Jerusalem.

289
00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:48.261
I can think of no better example of this

290
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:50.893
than in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

291
00:13:50.893 --> 00:13:52.935
Its architecture is a patchwork

292
00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:57.014
made from so many untold layers.

293
00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:59.657 line:15% 
Calvary chapel is built on the first foot or so

294
00:13:59.657 --> 00:14:03.877 line:15% 
of the rock upon which Jesus is said to have been crucified.

295
00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.697 line:15% 
Excavation that took place in 1973

296
00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:08.097 line:15% 
revealed a chapel

297
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:12.056 line:15% 
some 15 feet under this rock, called the Tomb of Adam,

298
00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:14.716
where the first human skull is said to be visible

299
00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:18.196
in the rock face.

300
00:14:18.196 --> 00:14:20.965
In fact, the term calvary, comes from the Latin

301
00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:24.826
Calvariae Locus, which is Golgotha in Greek,

302
00:14:24.826 --> 00:14:28.706
or the Place of the Skull, in English.

303
00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:30.846 line:15% 
Prior to the first Christian emperor,

304
00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:32.268 line:15% 
Constantine the Great,

305
00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:36.008
repurposing this site as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,

306
00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.364
it had been a temple of Venus.

307
00:14:38.364 --> 00:14:40.825
Before the Romans worshiped Venus,

308
00:14:40.825 --> 00:14:44.105
she was known in the Greek world as Aphrodite.

309
00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:45.824
And if we dig deeply enough,

310
00:14:45.824 --> 00:14:50.824
we find yet another layer on top of the Egyptian Isis.

311
00:14:52.044 --> 00:14:54.965
The notion of Christianity layering Egyptianism

312
00:14:54.965 --> 00:14:56.405
is nothing new.

313
00:14:56.405 --> 00:14:58.947
Here is Albrecht Durer's Renaissance depiction

314
00:14:58.947 --> 00:15:02.227
of The Man of Sorrows by the column.

315
00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:06.655
Note Christ's unmistakable Egyptian crook and flail posture.

316
00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:10.295
This is Durer's secret depiction of Christ as Osiris,

317
00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:12.335
the resurrected God.

318
00:15:12.335 --> 00:15:16.077
Durer then shows Christ being flagellated with said symbols

319
00:15:16.077 --> 00:15:18.858
in this later etching.

320
00:15:18.858 --> 00:15:22.397
Here is Osiris with his characteristic crook and flail

321
00:15:22.397 --> 00:15:24.978
in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

322
00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:26.797
Osiris as Lord of the Dead,

323
00:15:26.797 --> 00:15:30.611
presides over the weighing of souls ceremony.

324
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:33.529
Anubis measures the dead man's heart on the scale

325
00:15:33.529 --> 00:15:36.090
against Ma'at's feather of truth.

326
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.509
Her husband Thoth, scribe of the Gods,

327
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:40.180
records the result.

328
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.240
If the heart is lighter than the feather,

329
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.340
Horus will present the man's soul to Osiris in the Duat.

330
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.000
But if not, it will be devoured by the deadly Ammut,

331
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
the monster who was part crocodile, lion, and hippopotamus.

332
00:15:55.462 --> 00:15:58.858
Ma'at is currently personified as Lady Justice,

333
00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.978
holding scales and sword.

334
00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:04.358
Lady Justice adorns court houses around the world.

335
00:16:04.358 --> 00:16:06.438
Here she is in the Old Supreme Court Chamber

336
00:16:06.438 --> 00:16:09.738
in the US Capital.

337
00:16:09.738 --> 00:16:12.578
The Scales of Justice were also used in Christianity

338
00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:14.559
in the last judgement.

339
00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.878
Here are 15th century depictions,

340
00:16:16.878 --> 00:16:19.638
showing souls being weighed and judged.

341
00:16:19.638 --> 00:16:22.080
The beasts of hell certainly recall the terror

342
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.600
inspired by Ammut.

343
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.900
Spell 125 in the Egyptian Book of the Dead

344
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.599
lists what later became the Ten Commandments

345
00:16:31.599 --> 00:16:34.720
in Judeo Christian theology.

346
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.420
Everything goes back to Egypt.

347
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.180
If you ask someone off the street

348
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.579
where the holiest spot in Christianity is,

349
00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:43.321
you probably won't hear

350
00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:46.761
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

351
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:51.141
Most will think of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.

352
00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:53.781
The word peter, literally means rock,

353
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:57.342
and when Jesus said, upon this rock I will build my church,

354
00:16:57.342 --> 00:17:01.102
Simon became Peter.

355
00:17:01.102 --> 00:17:04.321
Thinking on all the rocks I've been studying in Jerusalem,

356
00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:05.805
it was natural for me to draw a line

357
00:17:05.805 --> 00:17:07.764
from the rock of Golgotha

358
00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:09.904
to the tomb of St. Peter in Rome.

359
00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.636
Here we go again.

360
00:17:15.965 --> 00:17:18.985
The line connecting Golgotha with the tomb of St. Peter

361
00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:22.406
passes directly over the center of the Campidoglio,

362
00:17:22.406 --> 00:17:24.460
marked today by the equestrian statue

363
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.502
of Marcus Aurelius.

364
00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:28.283
What we see in the Campidoglio

365
00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:30.244
is Michelangelo's vision for the

366
00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:32.484
top of the Capitoline Hill,

367
00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:37.064
the ancient world's original capital.

368
00:17:37.064 --> 00:17:39.544
It took a Renaissance genius to symbolically

369
00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:42.653
turn the Roman power equation on its head.

370
00:17:42.653 --> 00:17:44.374
So instead of having the Capitoline

371
00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:46.135
face the ancient Roman forum,

372
00:17:46.135 --> 00:17:47.959
as it had for two millennia,

373
00:17:47.959 --> 00:17:51.900
Michelangelo turned the Campidoglio 180 degrees

374
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.959 line:15% 
to face the Vatican.

375
00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:57.717
The Campidoglio's painting pattern

376
00:17:57.717 --> 00:18:00.677
depicts a twelve pointed elliptical star,

377
00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:05.537
symbolizing a zodiac, with the sun at the center.

378
00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:08.137
It is my contention that his long distance alignment

379
00:18:08.137 --> 00:18:11.717
was originally drawn to connect the seat of power in Rome

380
00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:14.397
with the Temple of Venus in Jerusalem.

381
00:18:14.397 --> 00:18:17.617
In the Christian era, the tomb of St. Peter in the Vatican,

382
00:18:17.617 --> 00:18:19.078
was strategically located

383
00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:24.078
to be a continuation in line with this ancient axis.

384
00:18:24.258 --> 00:18:26.338 line:15% 
It is no secret that Christian churches

385
00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:29.718 line:15% 
were often built atop places of ancient worship.

386
00:18:29.718 --> 00:18:32.377
In this way, pagan shrines were Christianized

387
00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:36.938
and their power absorbed into the body of the church.

388
00:18:36.938 --> 00:18:38.858
See how the alignment goes directly over the

389
00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:41.238
Arch of Septimius Severus?

390
00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:43.238
The line passes only a few feet away

391
00:18:43.238 --> 00:18:46.241
from the Umbilicus Urbis Romae, the Navel Stone,

392
00:18:46.241 --> 00:18:48.801
from which all distances in the Roman Empire

393
00:18:48.801 --> 00:18:50.321
were measured.

394
00:18:50.321 --> 00:18:55.321
All roads that led to Rome symbolically arrived here.

395
00:18:55.762 --> 00:18:57.863
Following the alignment through the Forum,

396
00:18:57.863 --> 00:18:59.583
we see that it goes through the center of the

397
00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:02.443
Roman Colosseum, where among other pastimes,

398
00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:05.143
spectators enjoyed gladiatorial combat

399
00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:08.323
and watching Christians being fed to the lions.

400
00:19:08.323 --> 00:19:10.672
This shape in the center of the Colosseum bowl

401
00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:13.104
suggests vesica piscis.

402
00:19:13.104 --> 00:19:17.724
Could this be a symbol of Venus?

403
00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:20.024
If so, what went on in the Colosseum

404
00:19:20.024 --> 00:19:22.568
somehow became the opposition of the love and beauty

405
00:19:22.568 --> 00:19:26.668
associated with Venus.

406
00:19:26.668 --> 00:19:28.668
The last stop on our alignment tour,

407
00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.888
is the largest ancient Egyptian obelisk in the world,

408
00:19:31.888 --> 00:19:35.088
including all of those still standing in Egypt.

409
00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:36.628 line:15% 
The alignment from Jerusalem

410
00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:40.168 line:15% 
passes directly over the tip of this 230 ton symbol

411
00:19:40.168 --> 00:19:42.064 line:15% 
in front of the Lateran.

412
00:19:42.064 --> 00:19:43.423 line:15% 
As you may have guessed,

413
00:19:43.423 --> 00:19:45.025 line:15% 
obelisks are one of the keys

414
00:19:45.025 --> 00:19:47.565 line:15% 
to unlocking the ancient mysteries.

415
00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:50.604 line:15% 
This obelisk wasn't always in front of the Lateran.

416
00:19:50.604 --> 00:19:53.866 line:15% 
It originally came from the temple of Karnak in Egypt

417
00:19:53.866 --> 00:19:56.946 line:15% 
and was moved to Rome by Constantine the Great's son

418
00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:59.927
in the 4th century.

419
00:19:59.927 --> 00:20:03.449
The last of the Renaissance popes, Sixtus the 5th,

420
00:20:03.449 --> 00:20:04.938
moved the obelisk from where it had been

421
00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:07.746
in the Circus Maximus, to the Lateran,

422
00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:11.466
displacing the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius,

423
00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:15.892
which as you know was moved to the Campidoglio.

424
00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:19.360
Now Sixtus the 5th was a very singular pope.

425
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.640
As is the custom when a pope dies,

426
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.200
the new pope chooses a name for himself.

427
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.221
I find it fascinating that Felice Peretti di Montalto

428
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:31.141 line:15% 
chose a name referencing both six and five,

429
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:34.248
in Sixtus the 5th.

430
00:20:34.248 --> 00:20:37.208
The fact is Sixtus the 5th redesigned much of Rome

431
00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:39.691
during his brief five year reign.

432
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:42.014 line:15% 
He considered moving the Church of the Holy Sepulchre

433
00:20:42.014 --> 00:20:43.716 line:15% 
in Jerusalem, to Rome,

434
00:20:43.716 --> 00:20:46.817 line:15% 
but the logistics proved to be too much.

435
00:20:46.817 --> 00:20:48.536
He did, however, succeed at moving

436
00:20:48.536 --> 00:20:51.956
four gigantic Egyptian Obelisks within Rome,

437
00:20:51.956 --> 00:20:55.796 line:15% 
completing the dome of St. Peter's, opening six streets,

438
00:20:55.796 --> 00:21:00.676
building 14 fountains, and much more.

439
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.918 line:15% 
Roman emperors were the first to raid Egypt

440
00:21:02.918 --> 00:21:05.619 line:15% 
in antiquity for its obelisks.

441
00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:09.039
By repositioning these obelisks in Renaissance Rome,

442
00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:11.341
Sixuth the 5th was motivated by something

443
00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:15.341
other than Catholicism.

444
00:21:15.341 --> 00:21:18.002
Researchers Jan Wicherink and Aaron Parlier

445
00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:22.082
reveal much of what Sixtus the 5th was up to.

446
00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:24.262
The red line shows a pair of obelisks

447
00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:27.422
aligned to the summer solstice sunrise.

448
00:21:27.422 --> 00:21:30.143
The blue line shows another pair of obelisks

449
00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:34.103
aligned to the winter solstice sunrise.

450
00:21:34.103 --> 00:21:36.305
Sixtus the 5th placed Egyptian obelisks

451
00:21:36.305 --> 00:21:39.728 line:15% 
in St. Peter's Square and in the Piazza del Popolo

452
00:21:39.728 --> 00:21:41.108 line:15% 
exactly as they are

453
00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:45.988 line:15% 
to create the red astronomical alignment.

454
00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:48.090 line:15% 
He engaged in a bit of urban renewal

455
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.330 line:15% 
by opening a straight street

456
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.251 line:15% 
connecting the ancient Roman obelisks

457
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:53.612 line:15% 
at the top of the Spanish steps

458
00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.963
and in front of Santa Maria Maggiore

459
00:21:55.963 --> 00:22:00.442
to make the blue astronomical alignment visible.

460
00:22:00.442 --> 00:22:03.246
Balancing the masculine symbol of the obelisk,

461
00:22:03.246 --> 00:22:06.285
Sixtus the 5th restored an ancient aqueduct

462
00:22:06.285 --> 00:22:08.429
and built fountains symbolizing the feminine

463
00:22:08.429 --> 00:22:12.208
to accompany most obelisks.

464
00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.611 line:15% 
Four fountains mark the crossing

465
00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:15.431 line:15% 
of the blue and yellow lines

466
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:17.954 line:15% 
connecting the Fontana dei Dioscuri

467
00:22:17.954 --> 00:22:19.731 line:15% 
and the Aqua Felice,

468
00:22:19.731 --> 00:22:24.352 line:15% 
all watery creations of Sixtus the 5th.

469
00:22:24.352 --> 00:22:26.377 line:15% 
The green line connecting the Vatican Obelisk

470
00:22:26.377 --> 00:22:27.753 line:15% 
with the four fountains

471
00:22:27.753 --> 00:22:31.595 line:15% 
marks equinoctial sunrise.

472
00:22:31.595 --> 00:22:35.540 line:15% 
Sixtus the 5th's tomb in the Basilica of Santa Maria Magiore

473
00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.600 line:15% 
was his final gesture,

474
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.162 line:15% 
linking his tomb with the astronomical alignments

475
00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:41.972 line:15% 
he set up in Rome.

476
00:22:41.972 --> 00:22:45.744
Why was Sixtus the 5th obsessed with astronomical symbolism?

477
00:22:45.744 --> 00:22:48.746 line:15% 
Perhaps because astronomy is another key

478
00:22:48.746 --> 00:22:52.575 line:15% 
to the ancient mysteries.

479
00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:54.515
In addition to the solar symbolism

480
00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:58.275
mentioned in the Washington, DC Part II episode,

481
00:22:58.275 --> 00:23:00.676
Bernini's redesign of St. Peter's Square

482
00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:02.456
has a deeper reading.

483
00:23:02.456 --> 00:23:04.860
Wicherink and Parlier claimed the two fountains

484
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.180
flanking the obelisk

485
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.500
represent a liquid axis,

486
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.260
symbolizing the galactic midplane of the Milky Way.

487
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.700
The axis going through the Basilica is the ecliptic,

488
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.882
and the other four paths

489
00:23:16.882 --> 00:23:21.182
represent solstices and equinoxes.

490
00:23:21.182 --> 00:23:23.643
In other words, the galactic and earth crosses

491
00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:26.222
coming together is an astronomical take

492
00:23:26.222 --> 00:23:31.222
on the underlying meaning of the solar octagram star.

493
00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:32.703 line:15% 
To top it all off,

494
00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:36.104 line:15% 
the Vatican Obelisk is surmounted by a cross.

495
00:23:36.104 --> 00:23:38.983 line:15% 
The official story is that this massive pagan symbol

496
00:23:38.983 --> 00:23:42.203 line:15% 
was Christianized in the simplest of ways

497
00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:44.624 line:15% 
by putting a little cross on top.

498
00:23:44.624 --> 00:23:47.204 line:15% 
Hancock and Bavaul write in Talisman,

499
00:23:47.204 --> 00:23:49.444 line:15% 
that an obelisk with a cross on top

500
00:23:49.444 --> 00:23:52.446 line:15% 
is actually the hieroglyph for Heliopolis,

501
00:23:52.446 --> 00:23:57.326 line:15% 
the city where this obelisk supposedly came from.

502
00:23:57.326 --> 00:23:58.587 line:15% 
On Christmas morning,

503
00:23:58.587 --> 00:24:02.251 line:15% 
this is the astronomical view from Vatican Square.

504
00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:04.290 line:15% 
Wicherink and Parlier have observed

505
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.619 line:15% 
that this silver gate of birth

506
00:24:05.619 --> 00:24:08.498 line:15% 
is due east of the obelisk in St. Peter's Square

507
00:24:08.498 --> 00:24:12.958 line:15% 
on the birthday of the savior.

508
00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:15.058 line:15% 
I noticed that the Galactic midplane

509
00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:17.919 line:15% 
leads right down to the Roman Pantheon.

510
00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:21.360 line:15% 
This is our cue to have a look at this ancient Roman marvel

511
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.654 line:15% 
and explore its deeper meaning.

512
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:27.046 line:15% 
Patrick Hunt, who teaches

513
00:24:27.046 --> 00:24:29.986
classical archaeology at Stanford University,

514
00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:31.086
calls the Pantheon

515
00:24:31.086 --> 00:24:33.301
the most impressive Roman monumental building

516
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:34.861
in the world.

517
00:24:34.861 --> 00:24:39.430 line:15% 
I see it as a calendar in stone.

518
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.810 line:15% 
Its rotunda is an engineering marvel

519
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.630 line:15% 
employing techniques such as reinforced concrete,

520
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.471 line:15% 
not rediscovered until almost 2,000 years later.

521
00:24:49.471 --> 00:24:50.879 line:15% 
In this plan view,

522
00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:53.019 line:15% 
you can see the floor pattern in which stone

523
00:24:53.019 --> 00:24:55.656 line:15% 
from all over the empire was inlaid.

524
00:24:55.656 --> 00:24:58.476 line:15% 
A testament to Rome's imperial might.

525
00:24:58.476 --> 00:25:01.096 line:15% 
Its circle and square motif might symbolize

526
00:25:01.096 --> 00:25:04.858 line:15% 
the earth moon system in the following way.

527
00:25:04.858 --> 00:25:07.737
Here a circle is inscribed within a square.

528
00:25:07.737 --> 00:25:12.437
The square has 27.3% more area than the circle.

529
00:25:12.437 --> 00:25:14.137
Comparing a circle in square

530
00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.777
with equal perimeters,

531
00:25:15.777 --> 00:25:18.479
the circle's diameter is 27.3%

532
00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:20.939
larger than the edge of the square.

533
00:25:20.939 --> 00:25:23.139
Okay, so what?

534
00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:27.839
Well the moon happens to be 27.3% the size of earth,

535
00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:30.061
which is another way of relating moon to earth

536
00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:34.281
with the proportion three to 11.

537
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:36.950
In addition, the moon's sidereal orbital period

538
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.858
is 27.3 days.

539
00:25:40.858 --> 00:25:43.078
The words moon, month, and menstruation

540
00:25:43.078 --> 00:25:44.559
all share the same root

541
00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:48.306
because they all have roughly the same period.

542
00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:53.306 line:15% 
Human gestation lasts on average 273 days.

543
00:25:54.566 --> 00:25:58.126
Another spooky coincidence has to do with temperature.

544
00:25:58.126 --> 00:25:59.646
As you are probably aware,

545
00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:03.079
celsius is defined by a 100 degree scale,

546
00:26:03.079 --> 00:26:06.559
marking the freezing and boiling points of water.

547
00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:10.159
Water becomes liquid 273 degrees celsius

548
00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:12.199
above absolute zero.

549
00:26:12.199 --> 00:26:13.899
Here are these numbers again.

550
00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:15.379
It seems to me that this fact

551
00:26:15.379 --> 00:26:18.819
references earth as a water planet.

552
00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:20.959 line:15% 
Why are these numbers the same?

553
00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:25.959 line:15% 
Science has no answer for this other than pure coincidence.

554
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.039 line:15% 
In this sectional view,

555
00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:31.242 line:15% 
you can see that a sphere fits perfectly within the volume

556
00:26:31.242 --> 00:26:33.263 line:15% 
the Pantheon encloses.

557
00:26:33.263 --> 00:26:36.470 line:15% 
I think recognizing this as the celestial sphere

558
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.600 line:15% 
is the key to the Pantheon symbolism.

559
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.507 line:15% 
The original roman statuary

560
00:26:42.507 --> 00:26:44.980 line:15% 
fit into the seven alcoves.

561
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.748 line:15% 
The Pantheon of pagan gods

562
00:26:46.748 --> 00:26:48.928
was replaced with Christian saints.

563
00:26:48.928 --> 00:26:50.309
When the building was christened,

564
00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:55.309
the Church of Santa Maria Rotunda in the year 609.

565
00:26:56.109 --> 00:26:59.729 line:15% 
Exchanging pagan gods for astrological symbols,

566
00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:02.054 line:15% 
we see an arrangement matching the Ptolemaic

567
00:27:02.054 --> 00:27:05.238
harmony of the spheres.

568
00:27:05.238 --> 00:27:08.358 line:15% 
To the modern eye, this sequence might seem arbitrary,

569
00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:11.098 line:15% 
but it actually ranks the planets in order of increasing

570
00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:14.002 line:15% 
apparent speed against the background of fixed stars

571
00:27:14.002 --> 00:27:15.942 line:15% 
as seen from earth.

572
00:27:15.942 --> 00:27:19.104 line:15% 
Ptolemaic cosmology is therefore an earthcentric approach

573
00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.984 line:15% 
to astronomy.

574
00:27:21.984 --> 00:27:25.224
Mark Booth writes, in The Secret History of the World,

575
00:27:25.224 --> 00:27:26.844
"Ptolemy's map of the spheres

576
00:27:26.844 --> 00:27:29.164
"is conventionally presented as having been

577
00:27:29.164 --> 00:27:31.843
"superseded by the ideas of Copernicus,

578
00:27:31.843 --> 00:27:35.886
"Galileo, and so onl but in fact was and is an

579
00:27:35.886 --> 00:27:39.645
"accurate map of the spiritual dimension of the cosmos,

580
00:27:39.645 --> 00:27:41.345
"a dimension which seemed more real

581
00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:45.429
"to the ancients than the material cosmos."

582
00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:47.449 line:15% 
Are you aware that the days of the week

583
00:27:47.449 --> 00:27:49.471 line:15% 
are named after the planets?

584
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:53.113 line:15% 
With the exception of Saturnday, Sunday, and Moonday,

585
00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:56.174 line:15% 
English speakers unfamiliar with Norse gods,

586
00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.392 line:15% 
might have an easier time spotting this connection in French

587
00:27:59.392 --> 00:28:01.275 line:15% 
or Italian.

588
00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:03.339 line:15% 
Connecting the days of the week in order,

589
00:28:03.339 --> 00:28:05.479 line:15% 
yields a seven pointed star

590
00:28:05.479 --> 00:28:08.343 line:15% 
somewhat distorted to accomodate squeezing it into the

591
00:28:08.343 --> 00:28:13.208 line:15% 
octagonal symmetry of the Pantheon.

592
00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:16.050
Looking up in the rotunda, you see the oculus,

593
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.397
or central void in the dome.

594
00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:20.710
The oculus is the sole source of illumination

595
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.370
in the interior.

596
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.317
So it clearly symbolizes the sun.

597
00:28:25.317 --> 00:28:27.608
The five rising tiers of coffers

598
00:28:27.608 --> 00:28:29.708
might represent the five planets

599
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:33.668
visible with the naked eye from earth.

600
00:28:33.668 --> 00:28:36.169 line:15% 
The 28 divisions around the circumference

601
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:38.749 line:15% 
is where things really get interesting.

602
00:28:38.749 --> 00:28:43.530
It is my contention that the 28 rays represent days.

603
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.039
Consider a month of four, seven day weeks,

604
00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:48.399
lasting 28 days.

605
00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:49.759
Thirteen such months

606
00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:52.739
add up to 364 days.

607
00:28:52.739 --> 00:28:56.919
The extra day need to round out a 365 day year

608
00:28:56.919 --> 00:29:00.658
is where we get the phrase, a year and a day.

609
00:29:00.658 --> 00:29:02.891 line:15% 
Richard Heath has traced this 13 month

610
00:29:02.891 --> 00:29:04.714 line:15% 
plus one day calendar,

611
00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:09.414
to the matriarchal societies of the Bronze Age.

612
00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:14.262
The Egyptian Sothic year lasted exactly 365 days,

613
00:29:14.262 --> 00:29:17.623
without compensating for leap year as we do today.

614
00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:20.727
Sothis is the Greek name for Sirius,

615
00:29:20.727 --> 00:29:24.269
the star the Egyptians based their new year on.

616
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:26.649
Any way that Father Time slices it,

617
00:29:26.649 --> 00:29:31.129
the 28 day division fits the Osiris story.

618
00:29:31.129 --> 00:29:33.689
The temple of Isis on the island of Philae

619
00:29:33.689 --> 00:29:36.950
has spa reliefs which tell the Osiris story.

620
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.110
Here Osiris has 28 stalks of wheat emerging from

621
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.630
his dead body.

622
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.552 line:15% 
The 13 pieces that Isis later reassembled

623
00:29:44.552 --> 00:29:49.512 line:15% 
symbolized the 13 month calendar of 28 day months,

624
00:29:49.512 --> 00:29:52.633 line:15% 
and his missing phallus represents the extra day,

625
00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:56.359
rounding out the Sothic year.

626
00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.839 line:15% 
Many religious stories encrypt astronomical information

627
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:03.259 line:15% 
in their core levels.

628
00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.599
Returning to Egypt for more wisdom,

629
00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:07.799
let's take a look at the earth moon diagram

630
00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:10.818
that came from studying the Great Pyramid.

631
00:30:10.818 --> 00:30:13.184
Recall how the relative sizes of moon and earth

632
00:30:13.184 --> 00:30:16.824
fit the diagram when the circle was squared.

633
00:30:16.824 --> 00:30:19.504
John Michell rediscovered the key to much more ancient

634
00:30:19.504 --> 00:30:21.677
wisdom still encrypted in this diagram.

635
00:30:21.677 --> 00:30:24.907 line:15% 
In his book, The Dimensions of Paradise,

636
00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:27.507 line:15% 
Michell expanded the number of spheres in the diagram

637
00:30:27.507 --> 00:30:29.132 line:15% 
from one to twelve

638
00:30:29.132 --> 00:30:32.292 line:15% 
for reasons that will soon become apparent.

639
00:30:32.292 --> 00:30:36.711 line:15% 
If the mean diameter of the moon is 2,160 miles,

640
00:30:36.711 --> 00:30:39.284
then the 12 moon evolution in the diagram

641
00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:42.451
encodes the great year.

642
00:30:42.451 --> 00:30:45.200 line:15% 
2,160 times 12

643
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.240 line:15% 
equals 25,920,

644
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.059 line:15% 
which is earth's precessional period.

645
00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.729 line:15% 
Each month is so-called great year,

646
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:56.749 line:15% 
is likened to an age in astrology.

647
00:30:56.749 --> 00:30:59.429 line:15% 
We are currently leaving the Age of Pisces

648
00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:03.712 line:15% 
and it's the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

649
00:31:03.712 --> 00:31:06.873 line:15% 
John Michell calls this The New Jerusalem diagram

650
00:31:06.873 --> 00:31:10.353 line:15% 
from his analysis of the revelation of St. John.

651
00:31:10.353 --> 00:31:13.702 line:15% 
A seven-pointed star resonates within.

652
00:31:13.702 --> 00:31:16.581 line:15% 
Remember the seven rayed diadem of Isis

653
00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:19.821 line:15% 
and the seven rays of the Statue of Liberty?

654
00:31:19.821 --> 00:31:22.784 line:15% 
I prefer to call this the Isis Diagram

655
00:31:22.784 --> 00:31:25.043 line:15% 
in reference to the older stream of knowledge

656
00:31:25.043 --> 00:31:27.690 line:15% 
coming out of Egypt.

657
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.190
The Isis Diagram encodes just intonation in music.

658
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.610
On the most basic level,

659
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.732
consider one octave of a piano keyboard.

660
00:31:36.732 --> 00:31:37.914
A total of twelve notes

661
00:31:37.914 --> 00:31:39.575
are divided by sharps,

662
00:31:39.575 --> 00:31:41.975
leaving seven white keys.

663
00:31:41.975 --> 00:31:44.181
The term sharp suggests the pointy heptagram

664
00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:46.422
doesn't it?

665
00:31:46.422 --> 00:31:49.083
As we'll soon see at Chartres Cathedral,

666
00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:51.623
music, along with astronomy, geometry,

667
00:31:51.623 --> 00:31:53.223
and number theory, are all keys

668
00:31:53.223 --> 00:31:56.264
to this ancient mystery.

669
00:31:56.264 --> 00:31:58.264 line:15% 
Expanding the Isis Diagram to contain

670
00:31:58.264 --> 00:32:00.586 line:15% 
four seven pointed stars,

671
00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:03.387 line:15% 
we have what I call the Osiris Diagram,

672
00:32:03.387 --> 00:32:06.907 line:15% 
which encodes the Sothic year of 365 days

673
00:32:06.907 --> 00:32:09.786 line:15% 
in the following way.

674
00:32:09.786 --> 00:32:11.349
The 28 tips of the stars

675
00:32:11.349 --> 00:32:14.049
represent days in the ancient month.

676
00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:16.130
12 circles surround a 13th

677
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.850
located at the center of the stars.

678
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.209
The circles represent months.

679
00:32:21.209 --> 00:32:23.390
13 months of 28 days each

680
00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.230
defines the year.

681
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.490
The earth circle underlying the sars

682
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.250
represents the extra day

683
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.012
and completion of the Sothic year.

684
00:32:32.012 --> 00:32:34.535
And the Sothic year was itself calibrated

685
00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:37.717 line:15% 
by the heliacal rising of the Star of Isis

686
00:32:37.717 --> 00:32:39.978 line:15% 
consort to Osiris.

687
00:32:39.978 --> 00:32:41.937 line:15% 
It's beautiful, the way the geometry

688
00:32:41.937 --> 00:32:45.757 line:15% 
matches the cosmology.

689
00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:48.040
The architecture of the universe is embedded

690
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.700
in Egyptian cosmology.

691
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.086
To perceive the larger ramifications of the cosmology

692
00:32:55.086 --> 00:32:56.586
we are rediscovering,

693
00:32:56.586 --> 00:32:58.987
let's break away from 2-D diagrams,

694
00:32:58.987 --> 00:33:00.489
and expore where we live,

695
00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:02.650
the third dimension.

696
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.092 line:15% 
It's a 3-D reality that 12 spheres fit perfectly

697
00:33:06.092 --> 00:33:08.052 line:15% 
around a central 13th,

698
00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:10.633 line:15% 
with all of them tangent to each other.

699
00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:15.133 line:15% 
All the 13 fit perfectly within an overarching sphere.

700
00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:16.954
I think this 3-D reality

701
00:33:16.954 --> 00:33:20.034
is the source of the obsession with the number 13

702
00:33:20.034 --> 00:33:23.294
that we've seen symbolized in so many places.

703
00:33:23.294 --> 00:33:24.974
Recall all the lucky 13s

704
00:33:24.974 --> 00:33:28.115
on the Great Seal of the United States.

705
00:33:28.115 --> 00:33:31.035
Lucky 13 might be more precisely described

706
00:33:31.035 --> 00:33:33.515 line:15% 
as 12 surrounding one.

707
00:33:33.515 --> 00:33:34.537 line:15% 
In The Last Supper,

708
00:33:34.537 --> 00:33:37.058 line:15% 
Da Vinci depicts Jesus in the center

709
00:33:37.058 --> 00:33:40.598 line:15% 
surrounded by twelve apostles.

710
00:33:40.598 --> 00:33:42.739
Geometrically speaking, connecting the centers

711
00:33:42.739 --> 00:33:45.839
of the 12 surrounding spheres with straight lines

712
00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:46.880
reveals what is called

713
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.441
the cuboctahedron.

714
00:33:50.441 --> 00:33:52.261
The cuboctahedron has faces

715
00:33:52.261 --> 00:33:54.761
composed of squares and triangles.

716
00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:56.985
Ad quadratum et ad trangulum,

717
00:33:56.985 --> 00:34:00.925
as they would say in the middle ages.

718
00:34:00.925 --> 00:34:01.890
As it turns out,

719
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.632
Cuboctahedral sphere-packing

720
00:34:03.632 --> 00:34:07.032
has exactly seven planes of symmetry.

721
00:34:07.032 --> 00:34:08.992
Do these numbers sound familiar?

722
00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:12.392
12 around one, with seven planes of symmetry?

723
00:34:12.392 --> 00:34:15.231
The cuboctahedron is the 3-D equivalent

724
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:18.545
of the Isis Diagram.

725
00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:21.354
The first ever known depiction of a cuboctaheron

726
00:34:21.354 --> 00:34:24.114
was drawn by Leonardo Da Vinci.

727
00:34:24.114 --> 00:34:27.488
He created this illustration for Luca Pacioli's book,

728
00:34:27.488 --> 00:34:31.288
De divina proportione.

729
00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:33.272 line:15% 
Pacioli and Da Vinci worked together,

730
00:34:33.272 --> 00:34:34.612 line:15% 
became close friends

731
00:34:34.612 --> 00:34:37.952 line:15% 
and later shared a house together in Florence.

732
00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:40.272 line:15% 
Pacioli was at the center of the Renaissance

733
00:34:40.272 --> 00:34:43.412 line:15% 
Hermetic obsession begun by Cosimo de Medici

734
00:34:43.412 --> 00:34:47.152 line:15% 
in 1430 when he obtained the Corpus Hermetica,

735
00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:49.839 line:15% 
a body of work compiled in the first few centuries

736
00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.339
of the common era,

737
00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:54.140
recounting words passed down by Thoth

738
00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:59.099
through the last of the Egyptian priesthood in Alexandria.

739
00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:01.056
Here is Pacioli with a mysterious

740
00:35:01.056 --> 00:35:04.888
transparent cuboctahedron half filled with water.

741
00:35:04.888 --> 00:35:07.468
Some believe the younger man standing next to him

742
00:35:07.468 --> 00:35:09.471
is Albrecht Durer.

743
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:13.557 line:15% 
In Divine Proportion, Priya Hemenway writes,

744
00:35:13.557 --> 00:35:15.472 line:15% 
"In the autumn of 1506,

745
00:35:15.472 --> 00:35:18.173 line:15% 
"Albrecht Durer wrote from Venice to Bologna

746
00:35:18.173 --> 00:35:20.101 line:15% 
"to the home of Luca Pacioli

747
00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:21.431 line:15% 
"in order to be initiated

748
00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:26.151 line:15% 
"in the mysteries of a secret perspective."

749
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:28.571
Clearly the cuboctrahedron was important

750
00:35:28.571 --> 00:35:32.431
to these Renaissance masters immersed in Hermetic knowledge.

751
00:35:32.431 --> 00:35:35.851
Perhaps they knew something we don't.

752
00:35:35.851 --> 00:35:38.844 line:15% 
In the 20th century, Buckminster Fuller was obsessed

753
00:35:38.844 --> 00:35:40.824 line:15% 
with the cuboctahedron.

754
00:35:40.824 --> 00:35:42.581 line:15% 
He called it the Dymaxian

755
00:35:42.581 --> 00:35:44.604
and built his philosophy around it

756
00:35:44.604 --> 00:35:47.584
because the cuboctahedron is the only polyhedron

757
00:35:47.584 --> 00:35:50.024
completely in equilibrium.

758
00:35:50.024 --> 00:35:52.624
All 12 vectors emanating from its core

759
00:35:52.624 --> 00:35:54.064
have equal angles

760
00:35:54.064 --> 00:35:59.064
in all of its internal and external edges have equal length.

761
00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:02.044 line:15% 
In the 21st century, the cuboctahedron

762
00:36:02.044 --> 00:36:04.966 line:15% 
is the foundation for physicist Nassim Haramein's

763
00:36:04.966 --> 00:36:07.006 line:15% 
Unified Field Theory,

764
00:36:07.006 --> 00:36:12.006 line:15% 
that offers a new solution to Einstein's Field Equations.

765
00:36:12.086 --> 00:36:14.147 line:15% 
Haramein claims that the vacuum,

766
00:36:14.147 --> 00:36:15.825 line:15% 
a term used by physicists

767
00:36:15.825 --> 00:36:18.404 line:15% 
to refer to a volume of space that is completely

768
00:36:18.404 --> 00:36:20.144 line:15% 
devoid of matter,

769
00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:21.964 line:15% 
actually has a structure,

770
00:36:21.964 --> 00:36:23.421 line:15% 
and this structure is based at the

771
00:36:23.421 --> 00:36:26.229 line:15% 
core on the cuboctahedron.

772
00:36:26.229 --> 00:36:28.329 line:15% 
What we perceive as empty space

773
00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:31.286 line:15% 
is actually a seething cauldron of energy.

774
00:36:31.286 --> 00:36:32.766 line:15% 
Physicists calculate

775
00:36:32.766 --> 00:36:35.451 line:15% 
that the amount of energy in each and every cubic centimeter

776
00:36:35.451 --> 00:36:36.648 line:15% 
of space

777
00:36:36.648 --> 00:36:39.675 line:15% 
exceeds the energy output of all stars

778
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:43.195 line:15% 
visible to the Hubble Space Telescope.

779
00:36:43.195 --> 00:36:44.935 line:15% 
The reason space seems empty

780
00:36:44.935 --> 00:36:47.895 line:15% 
is because all that energy is perfectly balanced

781
00:36:47.895 --> 00:36:50.015 line:15% 
in a state of equilibrium.

782
00:36:50.015 --> 00:36:52.775 line:15% 
It looks to us like nothing is there.

783
00:36:52.775 --> 00:36:56.068 line:15% 
Haramein has built his entire Unified Theory of Physics

784
00:36:56.068 --> 00:36:59.068 line:15% 
on cuboctahedral geometry.

785
00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:02.248 line:15% 
I believe Haramein is really onto something.

786
00:37:02.248 --> 00:37:05.069
His latest paper, The Schwarzchild Proton,

787
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:06.511
received the Best Paper Award

788
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:09.651
in a physics symposium in 2009.

789
00:37:09.651 --> 00:37:11.560 line:15% 
Modern physics seems to be catching up

790
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.469 line:15% 
with ancient knowledge.

791
00:37:15.469 --> 00:37:16.849 line:15% 
To understand astronomy,

792
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:18.769 line:15% 
one needs to have some background.

793
00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:21.238 line:15% 
Here's my crash course on esoteric astronomy

794
00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:23.348 line:15% 
in six quick lessons.

795
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.190
The earth revolves about the sun

796
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.551 line:15% 
in a plane called the ecliptic.

797
00:37:31.551 --> 00:37:33.533
The 12 constellations of fixed stars

798
00:37:33.533 --> 00:37:35.293
that intersect the ecliptic

799
00:37:35.293 --> 00:37:38.154 line:15% 
are called the zodiac.

800
00:37:38.154 --> 00:37:39.749 line:15% 
All the stars of the zodiac

801
00:37:39.749 --> 00:37:41.297 line:15% 
are actually our close neighbors

802
00:37:41.297 --> 00:37:45.657 line:15% 
compared to the size of our entire galaxy.

803
00:37:45.657 --> 00:37:48.877
The earth's equator is tilted some 23-and-a-half degrees

804
00:37:48.877 --> 00:37:52.336
with respect to the Ecliptic.

805
00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:55.601 line:15% 
Gary Osborn's fascinating Paradigmshift website

806
00:37:55.601 --> 00:37:57.522 line:15% 
shows how the angle of the earth's tilt

807
00:37:57.522 --> 00:37:59.602 line:15% 
is symbolized in art.

808
00:37:59.602 --> 00:38:02.764 line:15% 
Here are Isis and Osiris raising the Djed,

809
00:38:02.764 --> 00:38:06.165 line:15% 
which amazingly matches the angle of the earth's tilt.

810
00:38:06.165 --> 00:38:08.645 line:15% 
And here again the 23-and-a-half degree angle

811
00:38:08.645 --> 00:38:12.045 line:15% 
matches the slope of the pyramid on the dollar bill.

812
00:38:12.045 --> 00:38:14.425 line:15% 
Osborn has found this same angle symbolized

813
00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:18.888 line:15% 
in many other pieces of esoteric art.

814
00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:22.372
The earth's tilt is the reason we experience seasons.

815
00:38:22.372 --> 00:38:24.612
The seasons are defined by the earth's orbit,

816
00:38:24.612 --> 00:38:26.533
which contains two solstices

817
00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:29.593
and two equinoxes.

818
00:38:29.593 --> 00:38:31.637
Looking at the solar system from above,

819
00:38:31.637 --> 00:38:34.519
the seasons naturally make a cross.

820
00:38:34.519 --> 00:38:37.752
Wicherink and Parlier call this the Earth cross.

821
00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:43.768 line:15% 
Our galaxy is called the Milky Way

822
00:38:43.768 --> 00:38:45.830 line:15% 
because its myriad stars resemble

823
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.334
milk streaking our night skies.

824
00:38:49.334 --> 00:38:52.114 line:15% 
If you are able to look at our galaxy edge on,

825
00:38:52.114 --> 00:38:54.616 line:15% 
you would see it as a flattened disc.

826
00:38:54.616 --> 00:38:55.537 line:15% 
This flattened structure

827
00:38:55.537 --> 00:38:56.838 line:15% 
is what makes the Milky Way

828
00:38:56.838 --> 00:39:00.023 line:15% 
look like a narrowly defined streak in the sky

829
00:39:00.023 --> 00:39:03.545
rather than an even distribution of stars.

830
00:39:03.545 --> 00:39:05.669 line:15% 
The central plain of the galactic disk

831
00:39:05.669 --> 00:39:08.669 line:15% 
is called its midplane.

832
00:39:08.669 --> 00:39:11.509 line:15% 
The ecliptic is tilted some 120 degrees

833
00:39:11.509 --> 00:39:13.489 line:15% 
with respect to the midplane,

834
00:39:13.489 --> 00:39:16.671 line:15% 
naturally making a cross in two dimensions.

835
00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:20.900 line:15% 
Wicherink and Parlier called this the Galactic cross.

836
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.670 line:15% 
Imagine beginning a journey outside the galaxy

837
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.352 line:15% 
flying through the zodiac,

838
00:39:28.352 --> 00:39:31.212 line:15% 
passing by each one of the visible planets

839
00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:34.752 line:15% 
and stopping on earth for a while.

840
00:39:34.752 --> 00:39:37.573
After a short stay, you begin the journey home,

841
00:39:37.573 --> 00:39:39.373
traveling out past the planets

842
00:39:39.373 --> 00:39:40.753
through the zodiac,

843
00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:44.993
and on toward the center of the galaxy.

844
00:39:44.993 --> 00:39:48.413
This root describes the mystical journey of the soul.

845
00:39:48.413 --> 00:39:51.821 line:15% 
It is mirrored in the Ptolemaic, or geocentric, cosmology

846
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:55.542 line:15% 
that predated Copernicanism.

847
00:39:55.542 --> 00:39:57.252 line:15% 
The ancient Egyptians represented

848
00:39:57.252 --> 00:39:58.941 line:15% 
beginning and ending waypoints

849
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:01.010 line:15% 
along the journey of the soul

850
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:04.970 line:15% 
with silver and golden gates.

851
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.607 line:15% 
Wicherink and Parlier show that the

852
00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:08.088 line:15% 
direction of the silver gate

853
00:40:08.088 --> 00:40:10.635 line:15% 
is located between the horns of Taurus

854
00:40:10.635 --> 00:40:12.176 line:15% 
as seen from earth.

855
00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:14.037 line:15% 
You can find the horns by following

856
00:40:14.037 --> 00:40:15.918 line:15% 
Orion the Hunter's club

857
00:40:15.918 --> 00:40:18.798 line:15% 
or Monoceros the Unicorn's horn

858
00:40:18.798 --> 00:40:20.682 line:15% 
because both point at the intersection

859
00:40:20.682 --> 00:40:23.623 line:15% 
of the galactic midplane and the ecliptic,

860
00:40:23.623 --> 00:40:28.327 line:15% 
a point known to the Egyptians as the Silver Gate.

861
00:40:28.327 --> 00:40:31.198
Isis shown with horns framing the sun disk

862
00:40:31.198 --> 00:40:34.198
symbolizes her guardianship of the silver gate

863
00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:37.278
or gate of birth.

864
00:40:37.278 --> 00:40:39.280 line:15% 
On the opposite side of the zodiac,

865
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.181 line:15% 
the golden gate is located close to

866
00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:43.743 line:15% 
where the arrow of Sagittarius is pointing

867
00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:47.143 line:15% 
and where the stinger of Scorpio is reaching.

868
00:40:47.143 --> 00:40:48.843 line:15% 
The golden gate is the second place

869
00:40:48.843 --> 00:40:53.825 line:15% 
where the galactic midplane and ecliptic intersect.

870
00:40:53.825 --> 00:40:56.228 line:15% 
The winged scarab framing a sun disk

871
00:40:56.228 --> 00:40:58.285 line:15% 
was used to symbolize guardianship

872
00:40:58.285 --> 00:41:01.485 line:15% 
over the golden gate, or gate of death.

873
00:41:01.485 --> 00:41:03.584 line:15% 
The scarab is an appropriate symbol

874
00:41:03.584 --> 00:41:06.096 line:15% 
because of how this insect pushes dung balls

875
00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:08.495 line:15% 
backwards with its hind legs,

876
00:41:08.495 --> 00:41:11.736 line:15% 
mimicking the sun's retrograde precessional motion

877
00:41:11.736 --> 00:41:14.384 line:15% 
through the zodiac.

878
00:41:14.384 --> 00:41:16.829 line:15% 
The Coat of Arms for the state of Vatican City

879
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:18.928 line:15% 
features silver and gold keys

880
00:41:18.928 --> 00:41:21.089
because these are the keys to the kingdom

881
00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:23.228
that Christ gave to Peter.

882
00:41:23.228 --> 00:41:26.665
Pietro Perugino's fresco in the Sistine Chapel

883
00:41:26.665 --> 00:41:29.564
shows Christ giving one silver and one gold

884
00:41:29.564 --> 00:41:32.469
key to Peter.

885
00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:34.052
I see the two Roman arches

886
00:41:34.052 --> 00:41:35.393
flanking the fresco

887
00:41:35.393 --> 00:41:39.654
as secretly depicting the Egyptian silver and golden gates.

888
00:41:39.654 --> 00:41:42.054
The octagonal domed building in the center

889
00:41:42.054 --> 00:41:44.173
clearly represents the sun,

890
00:41:44.173 --> 00:41:47.061
and the perspective grid must be the ecliptic.

891
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:49.241
The people in the piazza are taking the

892
00:41:49.241 --> 00:41:51.993
journey of the soul.

893
00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:56.103
I was taught as a child

894
00:41:56.103 --> 00:41:58.183
to follow the outer edge of the big dipper

895
00:41:58.183 --> 00:42:00.663
to find the North Star Polaris.

896
00:42:00.663 --> 00:42:03.323
in the past this rule of thumb didn't always work

897
00:42:03.323 --> 00:42:06.282
because the celestial pole changes over time

898
00:42:06.282 --> 00:42:08.703
due to the earth's precession.

899
00:42:08.703 --> 00:42:10.059
when the Great Pyramid was built,

900
00:42:10.059 --> 00:42:12.612
the star Thuban in the constellation Draco

901
00:42:12.612 --> 00:42:14.513
was the North Star.

902
00:42:14.513 --> 00:42:16.873
Remember one of the pyramid shafts

903
00:42:16.873 --> 00:42:19.233
point at Thuban.

904
00:42:19.233 --> 00:42:20.134
The celestial pole

905
00:42:20.134 --> 00:42:22.634
actually traces out a circle in the heavens

906
00:42:22.634 --> 00:42:25.695
representing the 25,920 year

907
00:42:25.695 --> 00:42:27.719
precessional cycle.

908
00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:31.159
This cycle is called the Great Year.

909
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:34.677
In 3-D, the Great Year is seen as a precessional cone

910
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:39.217
swept out over time by the earth's tilted axis.

911
00:42:39.217 --> 00:42:40.897
The earth's precessional cone,

912
00:42:40.897 --> 00:42:42.937
the sun, and the galactic midplane,

913
00:42:42.937 --> 00:42:47.419
will precisely align on winter solstice 2012.

914
00:42:47.419 --> 00:42:50.364
Author John Major Jenkins calls this phenomenon

915
00:42:50.364 --> 00:42:53.785
Galactic Alignment.

916
00:42:53.785 --> 00:42:55.428 line:15% 
The Mayan Long Count calendar

917
00:42:55.428 --> 00:42:57.748 line:15% 
was designed to end on winter solstice

918
00:42:57.748 --> 00:43:02.103
December 21st, 2012.

919
00:43:02.103 --> 00:43:05.483
Acharya S says, in The Christ Conspiracy,

920
00:43:05.483 --> 00:43:07.524
"Many of the world's crucified godmen

921
00:43:07.524 --> 00:43:10.984
"have their traditional birthdays on December 25th.

922
00:43:10.984 --> 00:43:13.364
"This date is set because the ancients recognized

923
00:43:13.364 --> 00:43:16.424
"that the sun makes an annual descent southward

924
00:43:16.424 --> 00:43:20.504
"until after midnight of December 21st, the winter solstice,

925
00:43:20.504 --> 00:43:23.184
"when it stops moving southerly for three days

926
00:43:23.184 --> 00:43:27.140
"and was born again after midnight of December 24th.

927
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.781
"Thus, these many different cultures

928
00:43:28.781 --> 00:43:30.661
"celebrated with great joy

929
00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:35.581
"the sun of God's birthday on December 25th."

930
00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:40.581
Christmas 2012 marks the beginning of a new great year.

931
00:43:43.285 --> 00:43:46.125 line:15% 
The Milky Way galaxy has a rotational period

932
00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:48.725 line:15% 
that I like to call the Galactic year.

933
00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:53.725 line:15% 
It lasts approximately 224 million years.

934
00:43:54.285 --> 00:43:56.106
Our solar system is related to the

935
00:43:56.106 --> 00:43:58.527
larger cycle through number.

936
00:43:58.527 --> 00:44:01.587
There are 8,640 great years

937
00:44:01.587 --> 00:44:03.547
in the Galactic year.

938
00:44:03.547 --> 00:44:06.288
It's amazing how the earth's precessional cycle

939
00:44:06.288 --> 00:44:07.649
the number of the sun,

940
00:44:07.649 --> 00:44:08.534
and the Decad,

941
00:44:08.534 --> 00:44:12.858 line:15% 
harmonize with the Galactic year.

942
00:44:12.858 --> 00:44:14.438
Before the Italian Renaissance,

943
00:44:14.438 --> 00:44:17.038
there was an earlier flowering of ancient knowledge

944
00:44:17.038 --> 00:44:18.679
in Medieval France.

945
00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:21.211
This was initiated when nine self described

946
00:44:21.211 --> 00:44:23.151
Poor Knights of Christ

947
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:25.787
returned from a decade of excavation work

948
00:44:25.787 --> 00:44:30.787
undertaken in the Temple Mount of Jerusalem.

949
00:44:30.967 --> 00:44:33.007 line:15% 
The most famous preacher of the age,

950
00:44:33.007 --> 00:44:34.969 line:15% 
St. Bernard de Clairvaux,

951
00:44:34.969 --> 00:44:37.229 line:15% 
argued persuasively on their behalf

952
00:44:37.229 --> 00:44:40.670 line:15% 
at the Council of Troyes in 1129.

953
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.658
This resulted in the Templar Order being officially

954
00:44:43.658 --> 00:44:47.537
chartered and endorsed by the Catholic Church.

955
00:44:47.537 --> 00:44:50.851 line:15% 
The poor Templars instantly became a favorite charity

956
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:52.212 line:15% 
and it certainly didn't hurt

957
00:44:52.212 --> 00:44:53.373 line:15% 
when the Pope signed an order

958
00:44:53.373 --> 00:44:55.774 line:15% 
saying that they didn't have to pay any taxes,

959
00:44:55.774 --> 00:44:58.954 line:15% 
could pass freely through international borders,

960
00:44:58.954 --> 00:45:01.154 line:15% 
and were exempt from all legal authorities,

961
00:45:01.154 --> 00:45:02.994 line:15% 
save for his own.

962
00:45:02.994 --> 00:45:04.694 line:15% 
This also tells you something about

963
00:45:04.694 --> 00:45:09.535 line:15% 
just how powerful the papacy was in those days.

964
00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:11.675 line:15% 
The Templars accepted large donations

965
00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.395 line:15% 
in monetary deposits,

966
00:45:13.395 --> 00:45:15.576 line:15% 
started issuing letters of credit,

967
00:45:15.576 --> 00:45:17.805 line:15% 
opened banks in several countries,

968
00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:22.126 line:15% 
and essentially became the first multinational corporation.

969
00:45:22.126 --> 00:45:24.905 line:15% 
Very quickly the Templars had an abundance of gold

970
00:45:24.905 --> 00:45:27.589
and military power.

971
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:28.809
To me the question is

972
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:31.909
what did those nine poor knights find in Jerusalem

973
00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:34.905
that led to their meteoric rise in power?

974
00:45:34.905 --> 00:45:36.789
Could they have found Enoch's Cube,

975
00:45:36.789 --> 00:45:40.591
buried in the Temple Mount from before the Great Flood?

976
00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:41.611
Whatever the case,

977
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:45.611
I believe they unearthed knowledge, rather than gold.

978
00:45:45.611 --> 00:45:49.031
And with knowledge comes power.

979
00:45:49.031 --> 00:45:51.273
Speaking of someone with sacred knowledge,

980
00:45:51.273 --> 00:45:52.694
St. Bernard de Clairvaux

981
00:45:52.694 --> 00:45:55.257
is a fascinating figure.

982
00:45:55.257 --> 00:45:57.618
Norman Cantor had this to say about Bernard

983
00:45:57.618 --> 00:46:01.538
in his book, The Civilization of the Middle Ages.

984
00:46:01.538 --> 00:46:03.081 line:15% 
Bernard played the leading role

985
00:46:03.081 --> 00:46:05.362 line:15% 
in the development of the Virgin Cult,

986
00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:07.762 line:15% 
which is one of the most important manifestations

987
00:46:07.762 --> 00:46:10.802 line:15% 
of the popular piety of the 12th century.

988
00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:12.102 line:15% 
In early medieval thought,

989
00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.726 line:15% 
the Virgin Mary had played a minor role,

990
00:46:14.726 --> 00:46:17.605 line:15% 
and it was only with the rise of emotional Christianity

991
00:46:17.605 --> 00:46:19.166 line:15% 
in the 11th century,

992
00:46:19.166 --> 00:46:21.927 line:15% 
that she became the prime intercessor for humanity

993
00:46:21.927 --> 00:46:24.224 line:15% 
with the deity.

994
00:46:24.224 --> 00:46:25.484
Bernard wrote,

995
00:46:25.484 --> 00:46:26.760
"No one can enter heaven

996
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.161
"unless by Mary

997
00:46:28.161 --> 00:46:30.621
"as though through a door."

998
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.422
In this illumination, Bernard is shown

999
00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.182
receiving a stream of milk

1000
00:46:34.182 --> 00:46:36.182
from the Virgin's breast.

1001
00:46:36.182 --> 00:46:38.922
He wrote several works on the Queen of Heaven,

1002
00:46:38.922 --> 00:46:43.922
which was also an epithet used in Ancient Egypt for Isis.

1003
00:46:44.122 --> 00:46:47.122
Essentially, Bernard reintroduced the Cult of Isis

1004
00:46:47.122 --> 00:46:50.863
to the west, under the veil of Mary.

1005
00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:53.304
As the primary architect of the Cistercian

1006
00:46:53.304 --> 00:46:54.844
and Templar Orders,

1007
00:46:54.844 --> 00:46:56.824
Bernard's writings has a major impact

1008
00:46:56.824 --> 00:47:00.445
on the gothic building explosion that ensued all over Europe

1009
00:47:00.445 --> 00:47:03.865
for the next 300 years.

1010
00:47:03.865 --> 00:47:05.885
On building, Bernard wrote,

1011
00:47:05.885 --> 00:47:09.555
"There must be no decoration, only proportion."

1012
00:47:09.555 --> 00:47:10.956
As you've seen, proportion

1013
00:47:10.956 --> 00:47:14.997
is what sacred geometry is all about.

1014
00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:17.719
Although the current cathedral of Our Lady of Chartre

1015
00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:20.999
was begun a few decades after St. Bernard's death,

1016
00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:23.659
Chartre had long before been a pilgrimage center

1017
00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:26.499
dedicated to the Virgin.

1018
00:47:26.499 --> 00:47:30.102
Since 876, the site housed the Sancta Camisa,

1019
00:47:30.102 --> 00:47:33.844
a tunic said to have been worn by the Virgin Mary.

1020
00:47:33.844 --> 00:47:36.044
When the old church at Chartre burned down,

1021
00:47:36.044 --> 00:47:38.284
the relic was feared lost.

1022
00:47:38.284 --> 00:47:39.965
When the Sancta Camisa was discovered

1023
00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:41.945
unharmed in the ashes,

1024
00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:43.964
it was deemed a miracle.

1025
00:47:43.964 --> 00:47:46.165
The dramatic recovery of the relic

1026
00:47:46.165 --> 00:47:47.926
catalyzed medieval Europe's interest

1027
00:47:47.926 --> 00:47:49.826
in the building project.

1028
00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:52.425
And Chartre ended up becoming the first Cathedral

1029
00:47:52.425 --> 00:47:54.426
dedicated to Notre Dame

1030
00:47:54.426 --> 00:47:57.109
and one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture

1031
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:59.749
in the world.

1032
00:47:59.749 --> 00:48:01.964
More than a place of religious worship,

1033
00:48:01.964 --> 00:48:05.652
Chartre was also a cathedral school in the medieval period.

1034
00:48:05.652 --> 00:48:08.446
In this school, Platonic and Pythagorian thought

1035
00:48:08.446 --> 00:48:10.407
passed through a Christian filter

1036
00:48:10.407 --> 00:48:15.407
and resurfaced in the west after a thousand year hiatus.

1037
00:48:15.407 --> 00:48:17.991
Chartre remembers Pythagorus in this sculpture

1038
00:48:17.991 --> 00:48:22.266
in the right bay of the Royal Portal tympanum.

1039
00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.706
The seven liberal arts

1040
00:48:23.706 --> 00:48:27.767
comprised the curriculum taught in the school of Chartre.

1041
00:48:27.767 --> 00:48:30.226
The seven arts were split into two groups,

1042
00:48:30.226 --> 00:48:32.438
the trivium and quadrivium.

1043
00:48:32.438 --> 00:48:34.426
Trivium is where we get the word trivial,

1044
00:48:34.426 --> 00:48:36.867
because grammar, rhetoric, and logic

1045
00:48:36.867 --> 00:48:40.329
were considered basic but necessary skills to master

1046
00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:43.710
before studying the more challenging quadrivium subjects,

1047
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:47.330
which included number theory, music, geometry,

1048
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.750
and astronomy.

1049
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.712
Each one of the subjects in the quadrivium

1050
00:48:51.712 --> 00:48:56.051
serves as a key to the ancient mysteries.

1051
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:58.052
The seven medieval liberal arts

1052
00:48:58.052 --> 00:48:59.532
were a bit different compared to

1053
00:48:59.532 --> 00:49:01.692
a liberal arts degree today.

1054
00:49:01.692 --> 00:49:04.531
These subjects were taught only to the elite.

1055
00:49:04.531 --> 00:49:05.929
The so called servile arts

1056
00:49:05.929 --> 00:49:09.568
were taught to tradespeople employed by the elite.

1057
00:49:09.568 --> 00:49:11.069
The goal of the servile arts

1058
00:49:11.069 --> 00:49:13.098
was not to cultivate critical thinking,

1059
00:49:13.098 --> 00:49:16.537
but to develop specific skills required by farmers,

1060
00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:21.186
blacksmiths, carpenters, stone masons, and so on.

1061
00:49:21.186 --> 00:49:23.134
This liberal, servile division

1062
00:49:23.134 --> 00:49:24.741
mirrors the internal division

1063
00:49:24.741 --> 00:49:26.850
between speculative Masons,

1064
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:29.372
more commonly known as Freemasons,

1065
00:49:29.372 --> 00:49:31.199 line:15% 
and the operative stonemasons.

1066
00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:34.799 line:15% 
who actually built the cathedral.

1067
00:49:34.799 --> 00:49:37.059
Australian architect John James

1068
00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:39.460
has discovered how the floorplan of the cathedral

1069
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.721
was laid out ad quadratum,

1070
00:49:41.721 --> 00:49:44.164
as you can see from the red squares.

1071
00:49:44.164 --> 00:49:47.185
The smaller squares are half the size of the larger,

1072
00:49:47.185 --> 00:49:49.785
as octaves are related in music.

1073
00:49:49.785 --> 00:49:51.986
The template for the cathedral ground plan

1074
00:49:51.986 --> 00:49:55.307
clearly echoes the quadrivium.

1075
00:49:55.307 --> 00:49:58.668 line:15% 
Two millenia ago, famed roman archtect Vitruvius

1076
00:49:58.668 --> 00:50:01.173 line:15% 
described in his Ten Books of Architecture,

1077
00:50:01.173 --> 00:50:03.569 line:15% 
that effective temples are based on the proportions

1078
00:50:03.569 --> 00:50:05.428 line:15% 
of the human body.

1079
00:50:05.428 --> 00:50:08.858 line:15% 
Vitruvius's written description of ideal human proportions

1080
00:50:08.858 --> 00:50:11.798 line:15% 
later influenced many Renaissance artists,

1081
00:50:11.798 --> 00:50:16.798 line:15% 
including Leonardo da Vinci and Cesare Cesariano.

1082
00:50:17.351 --> 00:50:19.578
Here, Cesariano's Vetruvian Man

1083
00:50:19.578 --> 00:50:21.678
fits the cathedral's ground plan

1084
00:50:21.678 --> 00:50:23.058
and shows that it was based on

1085
00:50:23.058 --> 00:50:25.038
the proprotions of the human body

1086
00:50:25.038 --> 00:50:28.731
as laid out in antiquity.

1087
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:31.833
English professor of architecture, Keith Critchlow,

1088
00:50:31.833 --> 00:50:34.012
has discovered a fascinating correlation

1089
00:50:34.012 --> 00:50:35.491
between the floor plan

1090
00:50:35.491 --> 00:50:38.532
and front elevation of Chartre.

1091
00:50:38.532 --> 00:50:40.812 line:15% 
Intrigued by the fact that the rose windows,

1092
00:50:40.812 --> 00:50:43.493 line:15% 
containing the exquisite stained glass

1093
00:50:43.493 --> 00:50:46.596 line:15% 
and the famed labyrinth have equal diameters,

1094
00:50:46.596 --> 00:50:50.358 line:15% 
Critchlow compared the plan to the elevation.

1095
00:50:50.358 --> 00:50:52.198
The rose window and the labyrinth

1096
00:50:52.198 --> 00:50:55.361
line up perfectly, like so.

1097
00:50:55.361 --> 00:50:57.582
The golden ball atop the Sun Tower

1098
00:50:57.582 --> 00:51:00.652
aligns with the curve of the Apse here.

1099
00:51:00.652 --> 00:51:02.454
The Moon Tower's silver ball

1100
00:51:02.454 --> 00:51:04.559
corresponds to the rondpoint,

1101
00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:08.478
the center from which the chapels radiate.

1102
00:51:08.478 --> 00:51:13.478
Clearly the design is correlated in two separate dimensions.

1103
00:51:13.538 --> 00:51:16.318 line:15% 
Boaz and Jachin are the names of the two columns

1104
00:51:16.318 --> 00:51:18.959 line:15% 
that stood at the entry to Solomon's temple,

1105
00:51:18.959 --> 00:51:22.062 line:15% 
that are echoed in all Masonic temples today.

1106
00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:23.802 line:15% 
Boaz stood on the left

1107
00:51:23.802 --> 00:51:26.243
and the name Boaz means sun.

1108
00:51:26.243 --> 00:51:29.084
Jachin stood on the right, and means moon.

1109
00:51:29.084 --> 00:51:32.885
This symbolism matches the towers at Chartre.

1110
00:51:32.885 --> 00:51:34.925
Critchlow explains that the Sun Tower

1111
00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:38.564
is 365 English feet in height.

1112
00:51:38.564 --> 00:51:40.505
The Moon Tower is slightly shorter,

1113
00:51:40.505 --> 00:51:43.505
some 28 feet less.

1114
00:51:43.505 --> 00:51:46.105
These measurements suggest several things.

1115
00:51:46.105 --> 00:51:49.272
Number one, the design was based on the English foot.

1116
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:54.272
Number two, the 365 foot Sun Tower symbolizes the year.

1117
00:51:54.312 --> 00:51:57.431
And number three, the 28 foot difference in the Moon Tower

1118
00:51:57.431 --> 00:52:02.431
symbolizes the 28 day month of four, seven day weeks.

1119
00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:04.913
I think this metrology shows how

1120
00:52:04.913 --> 00:52:07.053
Chartre is a calendar in stone,

1121
00:52:07.053 --> 00:52:10.953
very much like the Roman pantheon.

1122
00:52:10.953 --> 00:52:12.434
Before the Christian era,

1123
00:52:12.434 --> 00:52:13.715
the grotto below Chartre

1124
00:52:13.715 --> 00:52:16.375
was a Druidic shrine of Isis.

1125
00:52:16.375 --> 00:52:17.356
Above the crypt today,

1126
00:52:17.356 --> 00:52:19.217
there is a black Madonna and Child

1127
00:52:19.217 --> 00:52:21.857
called Our Lady of the Pillar,

1128
00:52:21.857 --> 00:52:25.418
that many suspect has a meaning older than Christianty.

1129
00:52:25.418 --> 00:52:28.121
The Druid grotto housed a sacred dolmen

1130
00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:32.783
that was identified with the Womb of the Earth.

1131
00:52:32.783 --> 00:52:33.583
Think about it.

1132
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:36.472
Both Isis and Mary were called Queen of Heaven,

1133
00:52:36.472 --> 00:52:40.706
identified as so-called Virgins who had unusual conceptions

1134
00:52:40.706 --> 00:52:43.486
and later had sons who symbolized the sun,

1135
00:52:43.486 --> 00:52:46.126
who also shared the same birthday.

1136
00:52:46.126 --> 00:52:47.776
The story of Mary and Jesus

1137
00:52:47.776 --> 00:52:50.823
is a recapitulation of the ancient Egyptian story

1138
00:52:50.823 --> 00:52:53.802
of Isis and Horus.

1139
00:52:53.802 --> 00:52:56.571
The Black Madonna hints at her African origins

1140
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:59.631
while retaining just enough plausible deniability

1141
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:04.471
to avert uncomfortable questions for the Church.

1142
00:53:04.471 --> 00:53:07.993
Chartre Cathedral's axis is oriented to the summer solstice

1143
00:53:07.993 --> 00:53:10.253
sunrise, just like the red alignment

1144
00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:14.155
Sixtus the 5th setup in Vatican Square.

1145
00:53:14.155 --> 00:53:16.015
The labyrinth is not a maze

1146
00:53:16.015 --> 00:53:18.215
because there is only one path to follow

1147
00:53:18.215 --> 00:53:20.994
like the life we live from birth to death.

1148
00:53:20.994 --> 00:53:23.295
The labyrinth's 11 concentric rings

1149
00:53:23.295 --> 00:53:25.644
match the Ptolemaic cosmology

1150
00:53:25.644 --> 00:53:28.664
or spiritual dimension of the cosmos.

1151
00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:30.332 line:15% 
Walking the labyrinth is therefore

1152
00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:34.401 line:15% 
like taking the journey of the soul.

1153
00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:37.835
There are 112 cogs on the outside of the labyrinth,

1154
00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:40.536
a fact which has puzzled scholars.

1155
00:53:40.536 --> 00:53:44.376
In them, John James has discovered an unexpected connection

1156
00:53:44.376 --> 00:53:46.936
to the Arab world.

1157
00:53:46.936 --> 00:53:48.596
John James writes,

1158
00:53:48.596 --> 00:53:52.675
"The eight century Arab Sufi-alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan

1159
00:53:52.675 --> 00:53:55.798
"divided the four elementary qualities of existence,

1160
00:53:55.798 --> 00:53:58.158
"earth, air, fire and water

1161
00:53:58.158 --> 00:54:01.338
"into four degrees with seven subdivisions

1162
00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:04.699
"giving a total of 112 classifications

1163
00:54:04.699 --> 00:54:07.178
"which between them contained all the materials,

1164
00:54:07.178 --> 00:54:11.479
"liquids and gasses found in manifest creation."

1165
00:54:11.479 --> 00:54:13.000 line:15% 
Known in the west as Geber,

1166
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.440 line:15% 
and considered to be the father of chemistry,

1167
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.463 line:15% 
he worked in the court of caliph Harun al-Rashid

1168
00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:20.343 line:15% 
for whom he wrote the Book of Venus

1169
00:54:20.343 --> 00:54:22.283 line:15% 
on the art of alchemy.

1170
00:54:22.283 --> 00:54:25.303
His work paved the way for later Islamic and European

1171
00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:26.403
alchemists

1172
00:54:26.403 --> 00:54:30.903
in their search for the philospher's stone.

1173
00:54:30.903 --> 00:54:33.203 line:15% 
Among his long list of achievements

1174
00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:35.663 line:15% 
Geber pioneered techniques in glassmaking

1175
00:54:35.663 --> 00:54:37.324
that were used in the stained glass

1176
00:54:37.324 --> 00:54:38.825 line:15% 
directly above the labyrinth

1177
00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:42.445 line:15% 
that bears his philosophical number symbolism.

1178
00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.086 line:15% 
Modern chemsists still don't understand

1179
00:54:44.086 --> 00:54:48.967
what gives the Chartre glass such incredible vibrancy.

1180
00:54:48.967 --> 00:54:50.368
Sir Laurence Gardner says,

1181
00:54:50.368 --> 00:54:53.168
in the Bloodline of the Holy Grail,

1182
00:54:53.168 --> 00:54:55.709
"One of the greatest mysteries of Gothic architecture

1183
00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:59.308
"is the stained glass used in the cathedral windows.

1184
00:54:59.308 --> 00:55:01.988
"The first appeared in the early 12th century,

1185
00:55:01.988 --> 00:55:05.249
"but disappeared just as suddenly a hundred years later.

1186
00:55:05.249 --> 00:55:07.449
"Nothing like it has ever been seen before,

1187
00:55:07.449 --> 00:55:10.252
"and nothing like it has been seen since."

1188
00:55:10.252 --> 00:55:12.693
"Not only is the luminosity of Gothic glass

1189
00:55:12.693 --> 00:55:14.293
"greater than any other,

1190
00:55:14.293 --> 00:55:18.154
"but its light-enhancement qualities are far more effective.

1191
00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:21.274
"Unlike the stained glass of other architectural schools,

1192
00:55:21.274 --> 00:55:23.754
"its interior effect is the same

1193
00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:26.674
"whether the light outside is bright or dim.

1194
00:55:26.674 --> 00:55:29.235
"Even in twilight, this glass retains its brilliance

1195
00:55:29.235 --> 00:55:32.434
"way beyond that of any other."

1196
00:55:32.434 --> 00:55:35.658 line:15% 
Critchlow says in the, Chartres Cathedral A Sacred Geometry,

1197
00:55:35.658 --> 00:55:39.067 line:15% 
DVD, that he was approached by a Hindu gentleman

1198
00:55:39.067 --> 00:55:41.315 line:15% 
who explained the meaning of the number symbolism

1199
00:55:41.315 --> 00:55:43.537 line:15% 
on the western facade.

1200
00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:46.317
In Hinduism, chakras are traditionally symbolized

1201
00:55:46.317 --> 00:55:50.118
by lotus flowers with specific numbers of petals.

1202
00:55:50.118 --> 00:55:52.658
Amazingly, specific details on the facade

1203
00:55:52.658 --> 00:55:56.519
match this symbolism.

1204
00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:59.246 line:15% 
The facade is a reminder that the cathedral houses

1205
00:55:59.246 --> 00:56:00.946 line:15% 
the body of the church,

1206
00:56:00.946 --> 00:56:02.685 line:15% 
or more importantly perhaps,

1207
00:56:02.685 --> 00:56:06.352
Chartre is saying the body is the temple.

1208
00:56:06.352 --> 00:56:09.353
Chartre is a masterwork of hidden synchrotism

1209
00:56:09.353 --> 00:56:12.313
melding beleif systems that secretly transcend

1210
00:56:12.313 --> 00:56:16.311 line:15% 
Christian dogma.

1211
00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:18.733
The tympanum above the central front doors

1212
00:56:18.733 --> 00:56:19.996
of the Royal Portal

1213
00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:22.535
encodes an entire cosmology.

1214
00:56:22.535 --> 00:56:24.395
The four figures surrounding Christ

1215
00:56:24.395 --> 00:56:28.715
depict a man, eagle, lion, and bull.

1216
00:56:28.715 --> 00:56:30.195
In Christianity, these are the

1217
00:56:30.195 --> 00:56:31.855
four beasts of the apocalypse,

1218
00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:34.756
as described in the mystical visions of Ezekiel

1219
00:56:34.756 --> 00:56:38.076
and St. john of Patmos.

1220
00:56:38.076 --> 00:56:39.156
On the literal level,

1221
00:56:39.156 --> 00:56:40.736
it's Jesus with a halo,

1222
00:56:40.736 --> 00:56:43.436
waving at us from inside a vesica piscis,

1223
00:56:43.436 --> 00:56:46.716
surrounded by the four beasts of the apocalypse.

1224
00:56:46.716 --> 00:56:49.698
A strange collection of Christian imagery perhaps

1225
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:51.457
but not uncommon.

1226
00:56:51.457 --> 00:56:53.578
In time the four beasts became synonymous

1227
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:55.418
with the four evangelists,

1228
00:56:55.418 --> 00:56:58.419
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

1229
00:56:58.419 --> 00:57:00.739
However, when you understand the symbolism,

1230
00:57:00.739 --> 00:57:02.386
a reading of the encoded message

1231
00:57:02.386 --> 00:57:04.046
becomes possilble.

1232
00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:07.206
As you learned in my crash course in esoteric astronomy,

1233
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:10.325
these beasts are the fixed astrological signs

1234
00:57:10.325 --> 00:57:13.124
symbolizing the galactic cross.

1235
00:57:13.124 --> 00:57:15.277 line:15% 
Jan Wicherink says Christ's halo

1236
00:57:15.277 --> 00:57:18.938 line:15% 
represents the Earth cross.

1237
00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:21.045
I see the sun god welcoming you through the

1238
00:57:21.045 --> 00:57:24.709 line:15% 
galactic star gate at the moment of your apotheosis,

1239
00:57:24.709 --> 00:57:28.549 line:15% 
a royal portal indeed.

1240
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:30.872
I have uncovered sacred design templates

1241
00:57:30.872 --> 00:57:32.996
underlying the principal section drawing

1242
00:57:32.996 --> 00:57:35.276
cut through Chartre Cathedral.

1243
00:57:35.276 --> 00:57:37.256 line:15% 
Stephen Skinner identified circles

1244
00:57:37.256 --> 00:57:40.597 line:15% 
guiding the central vault and flying buttress designs

1245
00:57:40.597 --> 00:57:43.278 line:15% 
in his book, Sacred Geometry.

1246
00:57:43.278 --> 00:57:46.240 line:15% 
His observations allowed me to take the geometric analysis

1247
00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.760 line:15% 
a few steps further.

1248
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.521
I see two sets of three stacked rhombi

1249
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:53.340
guiding the wall design.

1250
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.940
Circles drawn from the tips of paired equilateral triangles

1251
00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.024
define the centers of the buttresses' intrados,

1252
00:58:00.024 --> 00:58:02.885
or lower curves, and mark the springline

1253
00:58:02.885 --> 00:58:05.842
of the lower arch.

1254
00:58:05.842 --> 00:58:07.401
This revolutionary design

1255
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:09.459
allowed the masonry to be lighter

1256
00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:10.815
and the windows larger,

1257
00:58:10.815 --> 00:58:12.316
admitting the flood of light

1258
00:58:12.316 --> 00:58:15.916
characteristic of the Gothic style.

1259
00:58:15.916 --> 00:58:18.275
Now you can appreciate how the walls at Chartre

1260
00:58:18.275 --> 00:58:21.358
were designed ad triangulum.

1261
00:58:21.358 --> 00:58:22.336
What is more,

1262
00:58:22.336 --> 00:58:23.878
the diameter of these circles

1263
00:58:23.878 --> 00:58:26.040 line:15% 
equals the size of the rose windows

1264
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.540
and the labyrinth.

1265
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.388
It's almost as if the designer never changed the distance

1266
00:58:30.388 --> 00:58:32.247
set between his compasses when

1267
00:58:32.247 --> 00:58:34.488
designing the entire structure.

1268
00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:35.335
Critchlow points out

1269
00:58:35.335 --> 00:58:37.695
that the names of the architects of Chartre

1270
00:58:37.695 --> 00:58:39.335
were never recorded.

1271
00:58:39.335 --> 00:58:44.234 line:15% 
They were known only as the Masters of the Compasses.

1272
00:58:44.234 --> 00:58:46.937
In researching the House of the Temple in DC,

1273
00:58:46.937 --> 00:58:48.697
I came across a rare depiction

1274
00:58:48.697 --> 00:58:50.717
of the Kabbalistic Tree of LIfe

1275
00:58:50.717 --> 00:58:53.357
in Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma,

1276
00:58:53.357 --> 00:58:57.498
shown here as a set of three stacked rhombi.

1277
00:58:57.498 --> 00:58:59.219
This knowledge encoded at Chartre

1278
00:58:59.219 --> 00:59:02.818
was preserved by Freemasons.

1279
00:59:02.818 --> 00:59:04.081
For the next revelation,

1280
00:59:04.081 --> 00:59:06.441
we turn to music and geometry.

1281
00:59:06.441 --> 00:59:08.483
In music an octave is the interval between

1282
00:59:08.483 --> 00:59:09.624
one note and another

1283
00:59:09.624 --> 00:59:12.244
having double its frequency.

1284
00:59:12.244 --> 00:59:16.105
In plane geometry you can symbolize the octave in two ways.

1285
00:59:16.105 --> 00:59:19.464
Ad triangulum or ad quadratum.

1286
00:59:19.464 --> 00:59:21.126
The circle outside the triangle has

1287
00:59:21.126 --> 00:59:24.266
double the diameter of the circle inside.

1288
00:59:24.266 --> 00:59:25.486
Circle outside the square

1289
00:59:25.486 --> 00:59:26.827
has double the area

1290
00:59:26.827 --> 00:59:29.627
of the circle inside.

1291
00:59:29.627 --> 00:59:30.568
The central vault

1292
00:59:30.568 --> 00:59:33.888
is defined by a larger circle having twice the diameter

1293
00:59:33.888 --> 00:59:36.049
of the smaller circle inside

1294
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:37.749
which itself is equal to the diameter

1295
00:59:37.749 --> 00:59:40.008
of all the circles in the wall section

1296
00:59:40.008 --> 00:59:43.009
the rose windows, and the labyrinth.

1297
00:59:43.009 --> 00:59:45.549
Chartre is therefore based on one circle repeated

1298
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:49.049
using musical principles.

1299
00:59:49.049 --> 00:59:52.509
Amazinglly the flower of life fits this geometry.

1300
00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:54.210
Perhaps the master of the compasses

1301
00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:57.689
used the flower as the overarching design template.

1302
00:59:57.689 --> 00:59:59.132
You can draw the flower of life

1303
00:59:59.132 --> 01:00:02.974
using compasses only.

1304
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:05.395
The nave width is set by a central circle,

1305
01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:07.334
which is tangent to four others

1306
01:00:07.334 --> 01:00:09.514
having equal diameters

1307
01:00:09.514 --> 01:00:11.941
The central circle shown within the yellow triangle

1308
01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:15.661
completes the picture.

1309
01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:18.571
Masonic society probably began around the time

1310
01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:20.451
Chartre was being built.

1311
01:00:20.451 --> 01:00:22.426
Recall how St. Bernard de Clairvaux

1312
01:00:22.426 --> 01:00:25.966
was instrumental in the formation of the Templars.

1313
01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:28.865
And later after the Templars were taken down.

1314
01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:31.405
The knowledge they unearthed from Solomon's temple

1315
01:00:31.405 --> 01:00:34.519
went back underground to survive in Masonry,

1316
01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:38.379
Rosicrucianism, and other secret societies.

1317
01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:40.559
Masonic square in compass's emblem,

1318
01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:41.880
often depicts these instruments

1319
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.940
surrounding the letter G.

1320
01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.160
As with most symbols,

1321
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.741
the meaning of G depends upon your level of knowledge.

1322
01:00:48.741 --> 01:00:52.088
I've seen it referred to at times as geometry,

1323
01:00:52.088 --> 01:00:53.849
the generative principle,

1324
01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:56.996
and most apprpriately for what I'm investigating,

1325
01:00:56.996 --> 01:01:00.458
the Great Architect of the Universe.

1326
01:01:02.908 --> 01:01:04.968
I discovered a long distance alignment

1327
01:01:04.968 --> 01:01:07.908
that leads from France to the United Kingdom.

1328
01:01:07.908 --> 01:01:09.948
This one begins very close to Chartre

1329
01:01:09.948 --> 01:01:11.875
both in time and space.

1330
01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:14.274
Chartre Cathedral was built at the same time

1331
01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:15.915
as Bourge Cathedral,

1332
01:01:15.915 --> 01:01:19.875
and is only a hundred miles away.

1333
01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:22.016
When I was studying Bourge Cathedral,

1334
01:01:22.016 --> 01:01:23.954
I kept thilnking about the connections

1335
01:01:23.954 --> 01:01:27.695
between the founder of the Gothic style and the Templars.

1336
01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:29.420
So I drew a line in Google Earth,

1337
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.281
from the central entry of the Bourge Cathedral,

1338
01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:36.653
to the entry of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland.

1339
01:01:36.653 --> 01:01:37.873
So what?

1340
01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:40.693
You can draw a line between any two points,

1341
01:01:40.693 --> 01:01:42.392
but you won't believe what the line passes

1342
01:01:42.392 --> 01:01:44.691
directly over in London.

1343
01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:47.590
The headquarters of the United Grand Free Masonic Lodge

1344
01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:51.110
of England.

1345
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.890
The United Grand Lodge of England

1346
01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:55.450
is the main governing body of Freemasonry

1347
01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.620
within England, Wales, and much of the

1348
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.601
former British Empire.

1349
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:03.582
The building is on Great Queen Street no less.

1350
01:02:03.582 --> 01:02:06.082
UGLE, as the organization is known,

1351
01:02:06.082 --> 01:02:08.103
seems to be a fitting acronym for it's

1352
01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:10.030
ugly-as-sin container.

1353
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.340
Historically 3rd on the site

1354
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.980
since Masonic meetings first started here in 1775,

1355
01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.555
a year before the American Revolution.

1356
01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:21.416
Perhaps some of America's Masonic founding fathers

1357
01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:22.798
planned the Revolution here.

1358
01:02:22.798 --> 01:02:25.678
I'm not sure.

1359
01:02:25.678 --> 01:02:27.218
When the Templars were around,

1360
01:02:27.218 --> 01:02:29.238
they controlled a sizeable district,

1361
01:02:29.238 --> 01:02:30.818
less than have a mile away

1362
01:02:30.818 --> 01:02:33.030
in the city of London.

1363
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.372
The temple includes Temple Church,

1364
01:02:35.372 --> 01:02:37.793
the adjacent middle and other temples,

1365
01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:41.173
and a host of related buildings.

1366
01:02:41.173 --> 01:02:43.533
The Templars themselves said they designed the

1367
01:02:43.533 --> 01:02:45.353
round portion of Temple Church

1368
01:02:45.353 --> 01:02:48.633
after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem,

1369
01:02:48.633 --> 01:02:51.053
which also features a rotunda.

1370
01:02:51.053 --> 01:02:53.335
Perhaps politics motivated them

1371
01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:57.835
to claim Christian providence for their temple.

1372
01:02:57.835 --> 01:03:00.476
Long time esoteric researcher John Smout

1373
01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:02.919
says a better geometric comparison

1374
01:03:02.919 --> 01:03:06.082
is between Temple Church and the Dome of the Rock,

1375
01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.263
which seems to have a high degree of correlation

1376
01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:11.050
with the round church's ground plan.

1377
01:03:11.050 --> 01:03:12.490
This makes more sense to me

1378
01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:14.330
as the Templars did take their name

1379
01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:17.010
from the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.

1380
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.586
Case in point, they were never known

1381
01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:22.831
as the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.

1382
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:25.491
Whichever building was ultimately their template,

1383
01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:27.651
the Templar influence was so powerful

1384
01:03:27.651 --> 01:03:30.672
that they actually got the patriarch of Jerusalem

1385
01:03:30.672 --> 01:03:33.331
to come to London and consecrate Temple Church

1386
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:36.551
in 1185.

1387
01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:38.791
Temple Church was brought to the public's attention

1388
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:40.311
in The Da Vinci Code,

1389
01:03:40.311 --> 01:03:41.573
where it was the scene of a shootout

1390
01:03:41.573 --> 01:03:46.532
amidst marble effigies of medieval knights.

1391
01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:47.892
The temple served at times

1392
01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:49.812
as the residence of kings

1393
01:03:49.812 --> 01:03:52.012
and representatives of the the Pope,

1394
01:03:52.012 --> 01:03:53.311
while Temple Church itself,

1395
01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:56.152
served as a depository bank.

1396
01:03:56.152 --> 01:03:59.233
I believe Smout's geometric analysis of Temple Church

1397
01:03:59.233 --> 01:04:02.914
is right on the money, if you'll pardon the pun.

1398
01:04:02.914 --> 01:04:06.164 line:15% 
The temple plan is laid out with triangles and squares,

1399
01:04:06.164 --> 01:04:08.425 line:15% 
which we know from studying Chartre cathedral

1400
01:04:08.425 --> 01:04:10.405
have hidden significance.

1401
01:04:10.405 --> 01:04:13.087
Triangles and squares are arranged in such as way

1402
01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:15.808
as to depict three cubes.

1403
01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.408
The symbolism of three cubes

1404
01:04:17.408 --> 01:04:18.830 line:15% 
is something we've seen before

1405
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:23.762 line:15% 
in the George Washington Masonic National Memorial.

1406
01:04:23.762 --> 01:04:25.242 line:15% 
I believe three cubes

1407
01:04:25.242 --> 01:04:28.211 line:15% 
symbolize the holographic nature of the universe.

1408
01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:30.746
The human, planetary, and stellar scales

1409
01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:33.254
resonating as a fractal structure.

1410
01:04:33.254 --> 01:04:35.595
As above, so below.

1411
01:04:35.595 --> 01:04:38.395
My reasons for coming to this unusual conclusion

1412
01:04:38.395 --> 01:04:42.795
will become apparent in the Paris episodes.

1413
01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:46.336
After the Great Fire of London in 1666,

1414
01:04:46.336 --> 01:04:48.797
Sir Christopher Wren was chosen to redesign

1415
01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:50.877
St. Paul's Cathedral.

1416
01:04:50.877 --> 01:04:52.897
He oriented St. Paul's in line

1417
01:04:52.897 --> 01:04:55.397
with the axis of Temple Church.

1418
01:04:55.397 --> 01:04:57.097
Extending beyond St. Paul's,

1419
01:04:57.097 --> 01:04:58.914
we see the alignment continues

1420
01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:01.734
to the Bank of England.

1421
01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:04.315
The bank was chartered in 1694

1422
01:05:04.315 --> 01:05:07.135
during the construction of Wren's Cathedral.

1423
01:05:07.135 --> 01:05:08.895
More than just a local branch,

1424
01:05:08.895 --> 01:05:10.914
the Bank of England is the central bank

1425
01:05:10.914 --> 01:05:12.921
of the whole of the United Kingdom

1426
01:05:12.921 --> 01:05:15.021
and in the model on which most countries'

1427
01:05:15.021 --> 01:05:17.661
modern central banks are based.

1428
01:05:17.661 --> 01:05:22.342
The Bank of England is literally the mother of all banks.

1429
01:05:22.342 --> 01:05:25.063 line:15% 
Recall how the Templars' meteoric rise in power

1430
01:05:25.063 --> 01:05:26.901 line:15% 
came in part by becoming the first

1431
01:05:26.901 --> 01:05:28.842 line:15% 
transnational bank

1432
01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.503
and how Temple Church itself

1433
01:05:30.503 --> 01:05:32.183
acted as a bank

1434
01:05:32.183 --> 01:05:36.923
whilst housing both royals and Papal representatives.

1435
01:05:36.923 --> 01:05:39.264
By tracing the alignment from Temple Church

1436
01:05:39.264 --> 01:05:41.984
to the Bank of England through St. Paul's Cathedral,

1437
01:05:41.984 --> 01:05:44.224
we draw a connection between Templars,

1438
01:05:44.224 --> 01:05:45.644
the modern banking system,

1439
01:05:45.644 --> 01:05:46.884
and the church.

1440
01:05:46.884 --> 01:05:50.546
Three powerful bedfellows.

1441
01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:53.126
The Bank of England presides over a street pyramid

1442
01:05:53.126 --> 01:05:55.386
in the heart of the city of London.

1443
01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.827
The symbolism of the bank over a pyramid

1444
01:05:57.827 --> 01:06:00.168
suggests a hidden power relationship

1445
01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:02.329
analogous to the House of the Temple

1446
01:06:02.329 --> 01:06:05.932 line:15% 
presiding over the pyramid of Washington, DC.

1447
01:06:05.932 --> 01:06:09.201
After all, pyramids are a clear symbols of heirarchy,

1448
01:06:09.201 --> 01:06:10.565
and one can read it as control

1449
01:06:10.565 --> 01:06:14.405
from the top down.

1450
01:06:14.405 --> 01:06:15.505
The base of the pyramid

1451
01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:17.205
contains the London Stone,

1452
01:06:17.205 --> 01:06:18.805
said to be the rock from wihch

1453
01:06:18.805 --> 01:06:22.047
all distances in the United Kingdom were measured.

1454
01:06:22.047 --> 01:06:24.828
The Romans laid this foundation stone in London,

1455
01:06:24.828 --> 01:06:26.150
just as they had done earlier with the

1456
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:30.630
Umbilicus urbis Romae.

1457
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:33.470
You could say this pyramid was built on a rock solid

1458
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.990
Roman foundation.

1459
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.291
Some of the greatest secrets are hidden in plain sight.

1460
01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:40.753 line:15% 
Isn't that strange?

1461
01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:43.173 line:15% 
I mean, if you ran a secret society,

1462
01:06:43.173 --> 01:06:45.900 line:15% 
why painstakingly encrypt your greatest truths

1463
01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.511 line:15% 
in alignments, city plans, and in architecture?

1464
01:06:49.511 --> 01:06:50.898 line:15% 
I would've thought there were better ways

1465
01:06:50.898 --> 01:06:54.237 line:15% 
of keeping secrets.

1466
01:06:54.237 --> 01:06:55.805
There must be some kind of power

1467
01:06:55.805 --> 01:06:58.645
gained or maintained by hiding these truths

1468
01:06:58.645 --> 01:06:59.705
out in the open

1469
01:06:59.705 --> 01:07:00.965
where many can see,

1470
01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:05.166
but few understand.

1471
01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:06.033 line:15% 
Sir Christopher Wren

1472
01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.894 line:15% 
was a brilliant mathematician, astronomer,

1473
01:07:08.894 --> 01:07:11.053 line:15% 
geometer, and architect.

1474
01:07:11.053 --> 01:07:12.022 line:15% 
He was an enlightened man

1475
01:07:12.022 --> 01:07:16.482 line:15% 
who clearly excelled in the seven liberal arts.

1476
01:07:16.482 --> 01:07:19.243
St. Paul's Cathedral is the most important building

1477
01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.640
of Wren's architectural career.

1478
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.129 line:15% 
Stephen Skinner pointed out in his book, Sacred Geometry,

1479
01:07:25.129 --> 01:07:26.630 line:15% 
that the length of St. Paul's,

1480
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:28.690
including its entrance steps,

1481
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:31.190
measures 555 feet

1482
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:33.310
and that this distance is equal to the height

1483
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:36.030
of the Washington Monument.

1484
01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:38.029
Recall how triple sixes and fives

1485
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:40.370
are encoded in singular measure

1486
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:45.370
as 6,660 inches equals 555 feet.

1487
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:47.810
St. Paul's length therefore symbolizes

1488
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:52.810
the relationship between macrocosm and microcosm.

1489
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:55.551 line:15% 
The distance from the floor of the cathedral

1490
01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:57.571 line:15% 
to the top of the cross on its dome

1491
01:07:57.571 --> 01:07:59.954 line:15% 
is 365 feet,

1492
01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:01.556 line:15% 
matching the height and symbolism

1493
01:08:01.556 --> 01:08:05.037
of the Sun Tower at Chartres.

1494
01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.917
St. Paul's is one of the few places

1495
01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:09.296
we're not surprised to see the English foot

1496
01:08:09.296 --> 01:08:12.636
used as the unit of measure.

1497
01:08:12.636 --> 01:08:15.297
Trying to decipher London from another angle,

1498
01:08:15.297 --> 01:08:16.898
I was lookng up Buckingham Palace

1499
01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:19.459
and wondering about the perfectly straight axis,

1500
01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:21.808
called The Mall, in front of it.

1501
01:08:21.808 --> 01:08:24.884
Wanting to trace where this obvious gesture leads,

1502
01:08:24.884 --> 01:08:25.904
I need to ask,

1503
01:08:25.904 --> 01:08:29.574
where does the royal axis go?

1504
01:08:29.574 --> 01:08:32.791
It appears that The Mall leads to the Admiralty Arch.

1505
01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:34.468
But then the axis seems to fade away

1506
01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:37.577
in the confusion of buildings along the strand,

1507
01:08:37.577 --> 01:08:39.557
or does it?

1508
01:08:39.557 --> 01:08:42.357
Tracing the axis beginning at Buckingham Palace

1509
01:08:42.357 --> 01:08:44.917
passing over the Victoria Memorial,

1510
01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:46.757
traveling along The Mall,

1511
01:08:46.757 --> 01:08:48.437
going under the Admiralty Arch

1512
01:08:48.437 --> 01:08:50.126
and through the buildings on the strand,

1513
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:54.785
the axis arrives precisely at Temple Bar.

1514
01:08:54.785 --> 01:08:57.974
Temple Bar was a gate designed by Sir Christopher Wren

1515
01:08:57.974 --> 01:09:01.583
to ceremonially bar access to the city of London.

1516
01:09:01.583 --> 01:09:02.863
It got the name Temple

1517
01:09:02.863 --> 01:09:06.443
from being directly in front of the Templar compound.

1518
01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:09.048 line:15% 
The temple was taken over by the Inns of Court

1519
01:09:09.048 --> 01:09:13.473 line:15% 
after the Templars were ousted in 1307.

1520
01:09:13.473 --> 01:09:15.562
The middle temple and outer temple

1521
01:09:15.562 --> 01:09:16.950
are two of the Inns of Court,

1522
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:18.770
to which all barristers in England

1523
01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:21.430
must today belong.

1524
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:24.351
In fact, the phrase, the bar, meaning the legal profession

1525
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:25.471
as a whole,

1526
01:09:25.471 --> 01:09:29.012
can be traced back to Temple Bar.

1527
01:09:29.012 --> 01:09:30.992 line:15% 
Wren's gate is no longer there,

1528
01:09:30.992 --> 01:09:33.475 line:15% 
but tradition and the law remain.

1529
01:09:33.475 --> 01:09:34.936 line:15% 
Traditionally the Lord Mayor

1530
01:09:34.936 --> 01:09:37.257 line:15% 
would offer the Sword of State to the Queen

1531
01:09:37.257 --> 01:09:38.318 line:15% 
when she passed through the gate

1532
01:09:38.318 --> 01:09:40.958 line:15% 
as a token of loyalty.

1533
01:09:40.958 --> 01:09:42.718 line:15% 
It is a little known legal fact

1534
01:09:42.718 --> 01:09:45.280 line:15% 
that the monarch may not enter the city of London

1535
01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.520 line:15% 
without the permission of the Lord Mayor of London.

1536
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.797 line:15% 
What's up with that?

1537
01:09:49.797 --> 01:09:53.337 line:15% 
I always thought the Queen was the one in charge.

1538
01:09:53.337 --> 01:09:55.058 line:15% 
You might be surprised to learn that

1539
01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.798 line:15% 
the Lord Mayor is not the mayor of London,

1540
01:09:57.798 --> 01:09:59.226 line:15% 
nor is the city of London

1541
01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:01.299 line:15% 
the same as Greater London.

1542
01:10:01.299 --> 01:10:02.400 line:15% 
Confused?

1543
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.703 line:15% 
The law can do that.

1544
01:10:04.703 --> 01:10:06.723 line:15% 
The person the Queen bows to

1545
01:10:06.723 --> 01:10:08.703 line:15% 
is the Lord Mayor of London.

1546
01:10:08.703 --> 01:10:11.843 line:15% 
He's the guy who runs the city of London Corporation,

1547
01:10:11.843 --> 01:10:13.528 line:15% 
a tiny private jurisdiction

1548
01:10:13.528 --> 01:10:16.647 line:15% 
that covers only about one square mile.

1549
01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:18.467 line:15% 
The wealthiest square mile on earth,

1550
01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:20.273 line:15% 
as it's often referred to,

1551
01:10:20.273 --> 01:10:22.850
is the Sovereign state within Greater London,

1552
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.291
whose boundary closely follows

1553
01:10:24.291 --> 01:10:28.914
the ancient Roman Walls of Londinium.

1554
01:10:28.914 --> 01:10:30.395
In Isaac Newton's day,

1555
01:10:30.395 --> 01:10:32.515
there were more than 200,000 souls

1556
01:10:32.515 --> 01:10:34.515
