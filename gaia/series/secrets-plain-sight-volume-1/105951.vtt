00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:10%
>>What secret obsession
is shared by kings, popes,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:10%
and presidents,
Templars, Freemasons,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:10%
and founding fathers,
Renaissance masters,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
modern architects, and NASA?

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:10%
What has been coded in art,
architecture, and urban design,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:10%
spanning the whole of recorded
history up to the present time?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
These are the secrets
in plain sight.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:10%
As a teacher of architects,
it was the buildings

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:10%
in Dan Brown's "The
Da Vinci Code,"

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:10%
"Angels and Demons," and "The
Lost Symbol" that started me

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%
on a journey of exploration.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
What I found encoded
in these structures

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
was stranger than fiction and
perhaps even more compelling.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:10%
Friends kept handing me
interesting nonfiction.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:10%
And after a while,
I felt that each

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
was a clue in some overarching
and interconnected mystery.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was seeing no more
than the tip of an iceberg.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:10%
As I investigated further, I
unwittingly began an initiation

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:10%
into the ancient mysteries,
as I progressively

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
uncovered a body of
knowledge cleverly hidden

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:10%
in plain sight in the design
of important buildings,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:10%
famous works of art, in
long-distance alignments

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
between sacred
sites, in the streets

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:10%
and public spaces of many
of the world's great cities.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:10%
What I have uncovered is a
story about monumental works

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:10%
specifically designed to
embody a symbolic program

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:10%
of ancient wisdom.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:10%
This wisdom relates
to core truths

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:10%
about the design or architecture
of the universe, best expressed

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:10%
by musical principles, sacred
geometry, and number theory.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
What I am calling "the
architecture of the universe"

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
is closely related to
the hermetic philosophies

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:90%
of Pythagoras and Plato.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.155 align:middle line:10%
All is number, all is mind,
indeed, all is consciousness.

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:10%


00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:10%
These ideas originated
before the pharaohs,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:10%
and the specifics of
this ancient science

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:10%
have been passed down
through the centuries

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:10%
by secret groups dedicated
to either preserving

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:10%
heretical ideas
in dangerous times

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:10%
or to exploiting the knowledge
itself for the acquisition

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:10%
of temporal power.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:10%
You might be
surprised to learn how

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:10%
people living at what historians
call the dawn of civilization

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:10%
possess the ability
to accurately

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:10%
measure the size of
the Earth and to survey

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:10%
long distances with a precision
rivaling GPS satellites.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:10%
You'll discover how the oldest
surviving temples elegantly

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:10%
encode an understanding of
earth, moon, and sun that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:10%
is in some ways more
advanced than modern science.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:10%
We'll travel virtually to Giza,
Stonehenge, Jerusalem, Rome,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:10%
Paris, London, Edinburgh, New
York, Washington, DC, Winnipeg,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:10%
and San Francisco,
searching for answers.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:10%
In these places, I uncover
an interconnected system

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:10%
of geometry and symbolism, going
back at least to ancient Egypt.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:10%
We'll find Pythagorean
triangles, Vesica Piscis,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:10%
rhombi, pyramids, octagrams,
enneagrams, and Zodiacs encoded

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:10%
in much of the world's great
architecture and urban design,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:10%
exposing a secret obsession
with ancient symbolism spanning

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:10%
the centuries on up
to the present day.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:10%
Many researchers
past and present

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:10%
have uncovered important
clues in this mystery.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:10%
I've synthesized the work
of many other authors

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:10%
and been fortunate to make
my own connections via books,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:10%
the internet, and
the democratizing

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:10%
power of free tools
such as Wikipedia,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:10%
Google Earth, and SketchUp.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to share with
you is an ongoing effort,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and I invite your participation.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe the time
is ripe to reveal

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
what has been hidden
for so many centuries

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and bring this body of
knowledge to public attention

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of all.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
