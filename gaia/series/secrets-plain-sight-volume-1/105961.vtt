00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>>Picking up the
alignment that started

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.650 align:middle line:10%
at the tip of the
Federal Triangle in DC

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:10%
through New York City's
Central Park to its endpoint

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:10%
at the center of
Stonehenge, we are

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.170 align:middle line:10%
wondering why would the
founding fathers in DC

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
and city planners
in New York City

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:10%
conspire to link
their fare cities

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
with this ancient temple?

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:90%
The reason is simple.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is at the
heart of the mystery.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a closer look.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The first monument
at the site was

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:84%
begun during the Neolithic
period around 3,100 years

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
before the common era.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And Stonehenge was completed
during the Bronze Age,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:90%
approximately 4,500 years ago.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's a reconstruction
of Stonehenge

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
phase 3 at its height
showing the sarsen ring

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.880 align:middle line:84%
with its stone lintels,
huge trilithons, and smaller

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
bluestones.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:10%
The larger Aubrey Circle is a
ring of 56 holes accommodating

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:10%
four standing stations stones.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Connecting the
station stones, we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
see what researchers call
the station rectangle.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:10%
The amazing thing is it has
precisely the same 5 to 12

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:10%
proportion as we've already
seen in DC and New York City.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Now we see where this proportion
comes from as this is surely

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:10%
the oldest known example.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:10%
The astronomer Gerald Hawkins
has shown how the station

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:10%
rectangle encode specific
astronomical phenomena,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:10%
including cycles of
earth, moon, and sun

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:10%
commemorated by
important festivals

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:10%
in the Celtic calendar.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:10%
Stukeley, one of the founders
of the field of archeology

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:10%
in the 18th century whose great
work was studying Stonehenge,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:10%
claimed that freemasonry was
a legacy of the druids who

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:10%
in turn got their knowledge
from the ancient Egyptians.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:10%
The seven pointed star inscribed
within the Aubrey Circle

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:10%
clearly locates the sarsen
ring and frames the horseshoe

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:10%
of trilithons and blue stones.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:10%
After identifying seven as Isis'
secret number in New York City,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm wondering if this
seven pointed star isn't

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:10%
the star of Isis?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian civilization
was at its height at the time

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:10%
of Stonehenge is completion.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And although we have no
archaeological evidence

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:10%
physically link
the two cultures,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:10%
it remains an
intriguing possibility.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Avebury and Syllabary Hill are a
short distance from Stonehenge.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists say
both of these monuments

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
were built at the same
time as Stonehenge,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:90%
approximately 5,000 years ago.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:10%
The late John Michell, said
to be father of the earth

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:10%
mysteries, and surveyor and
researcher, Robin Heath,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:10%
discovered amazing
relationships between all three

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:10%
Neolithic monuments in terms
of their precise locations

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:10%
upon the earth.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The base of Syllabary
Hill is 864,000 feet

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
from the center of Stonehenge.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
The sun's diameter
is 864,000 miles.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:10%
The distance from 51
degrees' north latitude

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:10%
to the latitude of Stonehenge
measures 10.8 Egyptian Royal

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:10%
Miles.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:10%
The mean radius of the
moon is 1,080 miles.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The latitude of
Stonehenge is 17.28 miles

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:90%
from the latitude of Avebury.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
We learned in DC how
1728 symbolizes the cube.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Avebury's latitude is precisely
360 divided by 7 degrees north.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Dividing a circle into seven
parts yields the star of Isis.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:10%
The placement of Stonehenge,
Avebury, and Syllabary Hill

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:10%
encode the numbers of the sun,
moon, cube, and heptagram star.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:10%
Please measure these things
yourself in Google Earth

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:10%
or with other methods.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:10%
This hard, metrological
evidence should completely

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:10%
revise our understanding
of prehistory.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Early in the 20th
century, archaeologists

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
discovered a quarry
in the Preseli Hills

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
where the bluestones
used in Stonehenge

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
were mined approximately
130 miles from Stonehenge.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Putting aside the
practical issue

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of how the builders
transported these large stones

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to the building site,
let's focus instead

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:90%
on an even greater mystery.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:10%
Heath had surveyed the distance
from Stonehenge to an island

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:10%
due west in the Bristol
Channel called Lundy.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:10%
When Heath told Michell that
the distance from the center

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:10%
of Stonehenge to a
small hill called

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:10%
The Tump at the
center of Lundy island

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:10%
was precisely the memorable
number 123.4 statute miles,

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Michell recognized the
number from his research

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:10%
and then all the pieces
quickly fit together.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
A statute mile is equal
to 5,280 English feet

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and is still used
to measure distances

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:90%
on roads in the United States.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Michell and Heath drew a
triangle connecting Stonehenge,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Lundy, and the Presley mine.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:10%
Two such matching
interlocking triangles

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:10%
form a rectangle that
has the same proportions

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:10%
as Stonehenge's
station rectangle,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:10%
and amazingly is exactly
2,500 times larger.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the greater temple.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
What is more, the distances
in the Lundy rectangle

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:90%
fit ancient Egyptian measure.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Robin Heath's brother, Richard,
pointed out in "Sacred Number"

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that 123.4 statute
miles is precisely

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
equal to 108 Royal
Miles the same unit

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen in
Edinburgh and DC.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
This is no arbitrary
distance, as 108 royal miles

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
is 1/32 of the polar
radius of the Earth.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The architects of
Stonehenge must

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
have chosen the building
site in relation

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to an origin point
originally selected

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:90%
at the center of Lundy island.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely sublime the
way Stonehenge resonates

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
with the whole region
and with the planet.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.835 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:06:22.835 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
108 is a number sacred to
many of the world's religions.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
are 108 prayer beads

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
in the holy rosary.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
The rosary is a key devotional
path in the Catholic veneration

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:90%
of Mary.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
The worshippers'
fingers keep track

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
of the number of
Hail Mary prayers

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
they recite by moving
along one bead at a time.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Hindus, Buddhists and Jains all
use Japa Mala prayer necklaces

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in much the same
way as Catholics.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, Japa Malas
are most commonly

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:90%
made with exactly 108 beads.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
These too are
fingered as the devote

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:90%
the chants or repeats mantras.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Whether the worshipper is
conscious of it or not,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the moon is ultimately
behind what they are actually

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:90%
venerating in 108 recitations.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
As I already mentioned,
the mean radius of the moon

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:90%
is 1,080 miles.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The connection between
goddesses and the moon

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is as old as humanity.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Co-incidentally,
the element silver,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
which has always been
associated with the moon,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
has an atomic weight
of 108 grams per mol.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
In the lost science of
measuring the earth,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Michell and Heath show
how the English foot

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
was derived from the earth's
equatorial circumference.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The distance around the equator
equals 360,000 times 365.242

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
with incredible accuracy of
99.994% the current standard.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
This means the distance
around the equator measured

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in English feet is
the number of days

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
in a year times the number of
degrees in a circle times 1000.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Historians have lost track
of when exactly the foot was

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
invented in the mists of
time, but you'll usually

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
hear some tired anecdote
about some old King's Bigfoot.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
We can now confidently
say that whoever

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
defined the English foot knew
the equatorial circumference

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth with an accuracy
in the thousandths of 1%.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:10%
We only achieved this
level of precision

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:10%
in Earth measure in 1995
when the global positioning

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:10%
system, or GPS, became
fully operational.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, we are not
the first to achieve

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:10%
this level of technological
sophistication.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:10%
The mile is also based on
the dimensions of the earth.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:10%
There are 12 to
the fifth divided

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.850 align:middle line:10%
by 10 miles in the meridian
circumference of the Earth.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:10%
528 is the resonant key that
both defines the statute mile--

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:10%
because 5,280 feet
are equal to one

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:10%
mile-- and the central frequency
of the ancient solfeggio,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:10%
an ancient musical scale
used in religious chanting.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Metrology, the science
of measurement,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is one of the keys to decrypting
the ancient mysteries.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
After all, the word geometry
literally means earth measure.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And virtually all ancient
measurement systems

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
were based upon the
dimensions of the earth.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:10%
As John Neal laid out in his
groundbreaking book, "All Done

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:10%
With Mirrors," which was
subsequently expanded upon

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:10%
and popularized in books by Jean
Michell and the Heath brothers,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:10%
the English foot turns out to be
the root of the ancient system

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:10%
wherein units designed to
measure different scales

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:10%
were interrelated by
fractional relationships.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:84%
The way the ancient system
used simple fractions

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is analogous to how the metric
system uses powers of 10

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
to interconnect units
used at different scales,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
such as millimeter,
centimeter, kilometer, etc.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:84%
As if these discoveries
weren't enough,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
John Michell and
Robin Heath stumbled

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
upon yet another amazing find.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
There is an island
just north of Lundy

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
called Caldey, where there is
a very old priory church built

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
over an ancient druid menhir.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
This island is located
at the two to three

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
point along the Presley
Lundy edge of the figure.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Musicians will recognize
this proportion

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
as the fifth-- the most
fundamental interval in music.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:10%
If you draw a line connecting
Stonehenge with the precise two

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:10%
to three point roughly
coincident with Caldey

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:10%
you get the
following proportion.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:10%
If the Lundy-Stonehenge
line is 12 then

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:10%
the Caldey-Stonehenge line
is the square root of 153.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, we'll
see this cryptic number--

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
153-- again in the Louvre
pyramid, and also in the Bible.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:10%
So what's up with the
square root of 153?

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:10%
Simple.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:10%
It equals 12.369, the number
of full moons in a year.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:10%
So the proportions of the
simple diagram in code cycles

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:10%
of sun, earth, and moon.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:84%
This is far too much to be
explained away by chance.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:10%
However, Michell and
Heath don't offer a theory

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:10%
as to how the Neolithic
tribes people knew

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:10%
the precise size of the Earth,
surveyed such long distances,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:10%
or understood subtle
mathematical and astronomical

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.910 align:middle line:10%
relationships living in
what we know for certain

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:10%
to be an utterly primitive
physical culture.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Logically, one must
consider the possibility

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that someone other than
Neolithic tribes people

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
built Stonehenge.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Michell and Heath's
work sadly hasn't

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
been accepted by the
scientists of our times

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and is ridiculed
as pseudo-science

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
because their research has
exposed how little we really

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
understand about the
origins of civilization.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:10%
I, for one, urge you
to keep an open mind,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:10%
and to weigh the
evidence yourself

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:10%
using the scientific method.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Academics today have little
tolerance for theories

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that completely upset
the apple cart if they

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:90%
wish to keep receiving funding.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an
unassailable theory either,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
but I will say that the
builders of Stonehenge

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
sure had some extraordinary
architects directing

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:90%
their work.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Fast forward four millennia from
Stonehenge and not far away,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Isaac Newton is hard
at work in London

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:10%
on his theory of gravity.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:10%
He's already invented calculus
to cope with the mathematics,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:10%
but now needs an accurate
value for the size of the Earth

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:10%
so he can calculate
its precise volume

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and thus fix his
gravitational constant.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Few realize that Newton was
much more than a scientist.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Today's scientists
downplay the fact

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.096 align:middle line:10%
that their greatest hero was
also a practicing alchemist,

00:13:13.096 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:10%
an art many today would
consider pseudo-science.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:10%
For example, Newton was the
first to quantify temperature

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:10%
in 1700 with a
scale that was based

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:10%
on the freezing and
boiling points of water.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:10%
I find it particularly
interesting

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:10%
that Newton chose to measure his
scale from zero to 33 degrees.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Conspiracy buffs are also aware
of Newton being identified

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in the Dossiers Secrets as
one of the grand masters

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Priory of Scion, an
offshoot of the Templars.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever his reasons,
Newton believed

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that the great
pyramids metrology

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
encrypted the true
dimensions of the earth.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
John Greaves,
professor of astronomy

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Oxford,
surveyed the Great Pyramid

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
just before Isaac
Newton was born.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Newton meticulously
studied Greaves work

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and based his own dissertations
on ancient metrology on it.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:10%
In 1637, Greaves made
the most accurate survey

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid ever
undertaken up to that point

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:10%
in history.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:10%
He was the first to make
the unlikely conclusion

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:10%
that the foot was at the root
of the pyramids measurements.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:10%
To commemorate his discovery,
Greaves inscribed a line

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:10%
inside the King's
Chamber measuring

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.630 align:middle line:10%
precisely one English
foot with the words

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.860 align:middle line:10%
"to be observed by all nations."

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:10%
The unfinished pyramid, that is
without its absent pyramidion

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:10%
cap, measures exactly
480 English feet

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:10%
in height, which also
happens to be precisely

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:10%
equal to 1/11 of a mile.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The width comes in
at exactly 756 feet.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus, the
father of history,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:84%
explained that the Great
Pyramid was originally capped

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
by a small model pyramid
called a pyramidion, which

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
was sheathed in electrum,
an alloy of gold and silver.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the valuable
pyramidion is long gone,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Richard Heath's metrology shows
the great pyramid's pyramidion

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
measured 1 and 1/11
feet in height.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
This metallic cap would
reflect the sun's light

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and look a lot like the shining
eye on top of the US dollar

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:90%
bill.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is the
sole surviving wonder

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:10%
It remains the oldest,
largest, and most accurate

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:10%
building ever built. It
was the tallest structure

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:10%
in the world for four millennia.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:10%
It is aligned within a tenth
of a percent of true North,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:10%
and its 13-acre base supporting
2.3 million blocks of stone

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:10%
is horizontal and flat
to within 15 millimeters.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
The mean opening and joins
between exterior casing stones

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:90%
is less than half a millimeter.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:10%
The scale and accuracy
are astounding.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe that even with
all the money in the world,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
we do not have the
technical capability

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
to replicate the
Great Pyramid today.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
There is much to be said about
the great pyramids proportions.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:10%
I've already mentioned
how 7:11 was encoded

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:10%
in the Statue of Liberty.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:10%
Renaissance artist
Albrecht Durer

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:10%
used the half triangle
proportion of 14:11

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:10%
in his esoteric masterpiece
Melancholia One.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Richard Heath has
found the half triangle

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:10%
also encodes 365
days to 20 moons--

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:10%
an interesting astronomical
take on the mystery.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Notice how Pi and Phi, two
of the most important numbers

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:10%
in mathematics, are also
implicated and interrelated

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:10%
in the pyramid proportions.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
John Charles Webb Jr. has
made a profound discovery

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
about the location of the Great
Pyramid that is unfortunately

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
widely ignored because of
its utter implausibility.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Using Google Earth, we can
measure the exact latitude

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of the center of the Grand
Gallery inside the pyramid.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It is 29.9792458 degrees north.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
The speed of light in the
vacuum is 299,792,458 meters

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, these
are the same numbers.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
This correlation is either
pure coincidence or evidence

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of something very profound.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:10%
The meter as a unit of
length and the practice

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:10%
of dividing time
into seconds would

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:10%
have to be coordinated for the
location of the Great Pyramid

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.350 align:middle line:10%
to encode the speed of light.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:10%
Nothing may sound
more improbable,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:10%
but this is exactly the
sort of numbers game

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:10%
that I think the
ancients played.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:10%
Consider the fact
that one second

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:10%
is one Earth rotation
divided into 86,400 parts

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:10%
because one day is
equal to 86,400 seconds.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:10%
Recall from the Stonehenge
in San Francisco episodes

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:10%
that the sun's diameter
is 864,000 miles,

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:10%
and 864 is the
number of the sun.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the second and
the mile were skillfully

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
designed to express this
beautiful harmony with the sun.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The kilometer was
originally defined

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
by assuming the earth's
meridian circumference equals

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:90%
40,000 kilometers.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:10%
In Paris Part 3 you'll
learn more about something

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:10%
I call the Canon of 400.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:10%
For a taste, consider that
during a solar eclipse

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:10%
the moon perfectly
covers the sun disk.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:10%
The only reason this
occurs so precisely

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:10%
is because the moon is exactly
400 times smaller than the sun.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
While at the same time, the
moon is 400 times closer

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth than the sun.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the earth turns
400 times faster than the moon.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps saying the earth
has a meridian circumference

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:10%
of 40 million meters
was no accident

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:10%
as it's in the same
number of canon.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:10%
I think the meter
was secretly designed

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:10%
to resonate with the sun.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, today the
meter is circularly

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
defined in terms of the speed of
light, which is itself measured

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
in meters per second.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Consider the possibility
that the meter

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:10%
is an ancient unit that
was merely reintroduced

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.295 align:middle line:10%
300 years ago during a time
of great hermetic obsession

00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:36.095 align:middle line:10%
in France.

00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:10%
With these facts in mind.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:10%
It is easier to see how
disparate units spaced

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:10%
on our planet source
of light truly encode

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:10%
the speed of light using the
location of the Great Pyramid

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Our history books
somehow missed the fact

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that architects at
the dawn of history

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
knew the speed of
light in the vacuum

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and the exact size of the
Earth with pinpoint accuracy.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the Great
Pyramid was made

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:10%
before the Egyptian culture
began by different architects

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:10%
entirely.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:10%
In 1964, Alex Badawy
and Victoria Trimble

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:10%
discovered that shafts
in the King's Chamber

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:10%
within the Great
Pyramid pointed directly

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:10%
at a belt star in the Orion
constellation and the Pole Star

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:10%
at the time the
pyramid was built.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
In 1993, Rudolf
Gantenbrink got permission

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
from the Egyptian
authorities to send a robot

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:90%
up shafts in the Great Pyramid.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
He was able to accurately
measure the exact shaft angles,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and this data allowed Robert
Bauval and Adrian Gilbert

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to run astronomical
calculations showing

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:84%
precisely where the shafts in
the kings and queens chambers

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:90%
are pointing to in the sky.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:84%
In their 1995 book, "The Orion
Mystery," Bauval and Gilbert

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
revealed that the shafts
in the Queen's Chamber

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.670 align:middle line:84%
point directly to the
star Sirius in the south

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and to the Pole Star
at the time the pyramid

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
was built in the north.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:10%
I can understand the
Pole Star connection

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:10%
because recognizing
that stars rotate around

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:10%
the celestial pole is the
most fundamental observation

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.320 align:middle line:10%
in astronomy.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:10%
But why do the other shafts
point to Orion and Sirius?

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:10%
The book "Talisman" by Graham
Hancock and Robert Bauval

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:10%
sheds light on this mystery.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
"Orion and Sirius represented
Osiris and his con sort Isis

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.750 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient Egyptians.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They are in a region
of the sky called

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
the Duat, the Egyptian
netherworld where

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
souls journeyed and were
judged after death."

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Hieroglyphs in the
3,400-year-old tomb of Thutmose

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
the Third explain the benefits
of copying the Duat upon

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
the earth.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
"Whoever shall make
a copy of the Duat

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and shall know it
upon earth, it shall

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
act as a magical
protector for him

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
both in heaven and in earth,
unfailingly, regularly,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and eternally."

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians
believed building copies

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of Orion and Sirius
upon the earth

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.280 align:middle line:84%
acted as magical talismans
bringing the power of heaven

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:90%
down to earth.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:84%
We've certainly seen a
much more recent example

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of this in Washington DC.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The Orion constellation is
often depicted as a hunter

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:90%
with a sword between his legs.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Dan S. Ward of
how alexandria.org

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
says, "No male wears a
sword between his legs,

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and very few hunters
carry a sword.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a more
appropriate description

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
of that which is hanging
down below Orion's waist

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.110 align:middle line:90%
is that of a phallus."

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:10%
The area of Osiris' phallus
contains the Orion nebula,

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:10%
one of the most studied
regions of space

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:10%
because it is an incredibly
generative area where stars are

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:10%
continually being formed.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:10%
How appropriate.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:10%
By the way, we are in the Orion
spur of the Milky Way galaxy

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:10%
and Sirius is the brightest
star in the sky by a wide margin

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:10%
because it is one of
our nearest neighbors.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:10%
We now have the
astronomical knowledge

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:10%
to recognize we are actually
quite close to the Duat.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:10%
Bauval and Gilbert showed that
the three pyramids of Giza

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:10%
actually have the same
position and relative sizes

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:10%
as the belt stars of Orion.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Gerhart Haney noticed that
just as the belt stars of Orion

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:10%
point at Sirius, the pyramids
point directly at Heliopolis,

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:10%
ancient center of
Egyptian science,

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:10%
art, and religion, which
was a single unified body

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.630 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge in ancient times.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras, Plato, and many
other ancient philosophers

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:10%
journeyed to Heliopolis
where initiated there

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:10%
in the Egyptian mysteries
and spread them in the West.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Today, the only thing that's
left of this entire city

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:10%
is a single obelisk,
which happens

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:10%
to be the oldest standing
obelisk in the world.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, this
single obelisk

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is all that's left of the
ancient Temple of the Phoenix,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
which was described
by Herodotus.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but recall Phoenix
imagery in the Security Council

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Chamber of the United Nations.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how many
connections there

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
are between the symbolism of
the elite and ancient Egypt.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:10%
You've already heard about
one Heliopolitan obelisk

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:10%
next to the Met in New
York City and its pair

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:10%
on the Victoria
embankment in London.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Rome has the remainder of
the heliopolitan obelisks

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:10%
left in the world.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Heliopolis was the cult
center for the nine

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:10%
great Egyptian gods,
collectively called the Ennead.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:10%
We'll learn more about the
Ennead in San Francisco.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:10%


00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:10%
In the first decade
of the 20th century,

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:10%
G.I. Gurdjieff went
on a mystical journey

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:10%
where he met with a
number of remarkable men.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:10%
At Mount Athos in Greece
he was supposedly entrusted

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:10%
with the key to decoding ancient
Egyptian knowledge preserved

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:10%
by the Sufi Sarmoung
Brotherhood.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:10%
The key he received is the
enneagram and the means

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:10%
to decipher it.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
"The enneagram is the
fundamental hieroglyph

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
of a universal language.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
All knowledge can be
included in the enneagram,

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and with the help
of the enneagram

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:90%
it can be interpreted."

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff philosophy was
popularized by his pupil

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Ouspensky, and through him
the enneagram found its way

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:90%
into modern psychology.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:10%
The enneagram of
personality is a typology

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:10%
described by Riso
and Hudson that's

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:10%
used in business,
psychotherapy, arts, education,

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:10%
and for spiritual development.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:10%
The Baha'i faith correspondingly
uses a nine-pointed star

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:10%
as its symbol.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Baha'i scripture specifies
that every house of worship

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:84%
must feature a
nine-sided great room.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:10%
There is even a
Christian connection.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:10%
In the ninth book of
the New Testament,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:10%
Saint Paul wrote "the
fruit of the Holy Spirit

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:10%
is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness,

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:10%
faithfulness, gentleness
and self-control.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Against such things
there is no law."

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:10%
Here is the
traditional depiction

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:10%
of the fruits of the
Holy Spirit shown

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:10%
with first letters in Latin.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:10%
It's another nine-pointed star.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
With these things in mind, let's
explore the sacred geometry

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of San Francisco.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
San Francisco is

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:90%
steeped in Egyptian Symbolism.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:10%
The original Michael H. De Young
Museum that was built in 1894

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:10%
had an Egyptian theme,
complete with an under pyramid

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:10%
entrance that anticipated the
recent addition to the Louvre.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.553 align:middle line:84%
The museum was unfortunately
destroyed in the 1908

00:26:52.553 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
earthquake, and the De
Young Museum is presently

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:90%
in its third incarnation.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:10%
However, the two Sphinx that
flanked the original museum's

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.630 align:middle line:10%
entrance are still there.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The Transamerica Pyramid
is a landmark worldwide,

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and is the most famous
building in the city.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But the Transamerica
Pyramid neither

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
houses the headquarters of
the Transamerica corporation,

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:90%
nor is it really a pyramid.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:10%
Does it remind
you of an obelisk?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:10%
It's clearly not a true obelisk
because it's not carved out

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:10%
of a single piece of granite,
and the elevator core

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:10%
protrudes out of the
sides of the structure.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But we can see beyond
this modern necessity

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:90%
to perceive its symbolism.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:10%
The height of the 1972 structure
is commonly cited at 853 feet,

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:10%
but this figure doesn't
include the glass pyramidion

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:10%
cap and its mast.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:10%
Adding the additional 11
feet, brings the total

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:10%
up to 864 feet, making this the
tallest obelisk in the world,

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:10%
far exceeding the Washington
Monument's 555 feet.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.345 align:middle line:84%
And 864 is a very
interesting number indeed.

00:28:02.345 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:10%
As you learned at Stonehenge,
the sun's diameter

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:10%
happens to be 864,000 miles.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:10%
In addition, there are exactly
86,400 seconds in a day.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:10%
By making the Transamerica
Pyramid 864 feet high,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:10%
the architect was clearly
making it a solar symbol.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.850 align:middle line:10%
The glass pyramidion cap
contains a brilliant light

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:10%
that shines forth on July 4th.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:84%
In addition to it being
US Independence Day,

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
July 4th is also
aphelion, the day

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the earth is farthest from
the sun in its yearly cycle.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:10%
The Transamerica Pyramid
occupies a privileged site

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:10%
in the streets of San Francisco.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
It marks the end point
of Columbus Avenue,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
which cuts across the street
grid at a 40 degree angle.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.590 align:middle line:10%
It's funny, but I recognize the
significance of this 40 degree

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:10%
angle immediately because I had
just been hired by an architect

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:10%
to make a 3D model of
his nine-sided atrium.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:10%
This incredible
synchronicity is what allowed

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:10%
me to make the next discovery.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:10%
When I overlaid a
nine-sided figure

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:10%
on the streets of San
Francisco, here is what I found.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:10%
The Transamerica Pyramid
fits this vertex.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Columbus Avenue runs along
this edge, the grid of streets

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:10%
matches this edges
40 degree turn.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And most significantly,
it appears

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.491 align:middle line:84%
that Treasure Island was
designed to fit this figure.

00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:10%
Treasure Island was
completed in 1937

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.190 align:middle line:10%
in time for the Golden Gate
international exposition.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:10%
The US navy controversially
seized Treasure Island

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:10%
from the city of San
Francisco during World War II.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:10%
The Navy built the unusual
star shaped barracks

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.230 align:middle line:10%
in the approximate location of
the tower that had been torn

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:10%
down after the expo and '37.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:10%
The barracks also
happened to be exactly

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:10%
at the midpoint of this
edge of the diagram.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
While I'm not certain what
the barracks symbolize,

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
their shape and position
does seem significant.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Masonic author,
Albert Churchward,

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:84%
says the hieroglyph of the risen
sun god Horus looks like this.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, six triangles
in hieroglyphs

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.760 align:middle line:90%
means land of the spirits.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.210 align:middle line:84%
In any case, the Navy base
was recently decommissioned

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:84%
and Treasure Island is
now open to the public.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I went there to find
the barracks abandoned,

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
but the strange symbolism
remains at least

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:90%
for a little while longer.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:10%
There is currently
a plan in the works

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:10%
to build a large mixed-use
development on Treasure Island.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:10%
The plan scheduled
to be completed

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.170 align:middle line:10%
in 2022 calls for a
650 foot tall sun tower

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:10%
to be constructed where the
star shaped barracks are today.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally,
the single bus line

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that serves Treasure
Island is route 108.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Again in the
Stonehenge segment, you

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
learned why 108
symbolizes the moon.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:10%
So in a few years, you'll
be able to ride the moon

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:10%
bus to the sun tower.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:10%
In the Great Pyramid segment, we
studied the ennead or pantheon

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:10%
of the nine ancient Egyptian
gods worshiped at Heliopolis,

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:10%
the city of the sun.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
When we layer the ennead
over the nine-sided figure,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
we see the correlation between
the solar Transamerica America

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.010 align:middle line:84%
pyramid and the phallic
obelisk of Osiris.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:84%
When I turned on the terrain
layer in Google Earth,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Telegraph Hill poked up
through the ennead layer,

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:84%
so I started
researching Coit Tower.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:10%
It was designed by
Arthur Brown Jr. in 1933

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:10%
after Brown designed three
buildings in the Federal

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Triangle, which you'll
remember figured prominently

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:10%
in the secret architecture
of Washington DC.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The octagonal top of Coit Tower
fits within the octagram star,

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
which you saw in
Washington DC part two is

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:90%
a classic solar symbol.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this
is coincidental?

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:10%
There were four pairs
of male and female gods

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:10%
in the oldest Egyptian
creation myth, which

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.815 align:middle line:10%
pre-dated the ennead.

00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:24.840 align:middle line:10%
The Ogdoad, as the
eight gods were known,

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:10%
was venerated in Hermopolis,
the city of Hermes.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Hermes was his Greek name,
Mercury was his Roman one.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.800 align:middle line:84%
While both names echo Thoth,
source of the Egyptian wisdom.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
All of these names
supposedly reference

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the same immortal figure who
dispensed wisdom to humanity

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:90%
at different points in history.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The subtle arcs along the
sides of the structure

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.920 align:middle line:84%
suggest the interlocking circles
of the vesica piscis, which

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:90%
represents the female genitals.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps not surprisingly
and just like the Washington

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Monument, Coit Tower
symbolizes the act of coitus

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred union
of Isis and Osiris.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Hancock and Bauval have well
documented in their book

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:10%
"Talisman" how Thoth's
knowledge-base was passed down

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:10%
through the Gnostics, Manichees,
Bogomills, and Cathars.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:10%
All were ruthlessly wiped
out by the Catholic church.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.140 align:middle line:10%
Any remaining followers were
then completely annihilated

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:10%
by the Inquisition.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.640 align:middle line:10%
Thankfully, the Pope's
weren't entirely

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:10%
successful in instituting
a permanent dark age

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:10%
because a century after
the Inquisition Cosimo de'

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.260 align:middle line:10%
Medici recovered the
Corpus Medica, which

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:10%
was written in the first
century in Alexandria.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:10%
This older stream of
hermetic knowledge

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:10%
that escaped the burning of
the Library of Alexandria

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.930 align:middle line:10%
actually fueled the
Italian Renaissance

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:10%
and then went underground
in secret societies

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:10%
that persists to this day.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Gate
is neither golden,

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:90%
nor is it literally a gate.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's the red
bridge built the same year

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.639 align:middle line:90%
as Treasure island.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
Known throughout the world as
an engineering marvel and symbol

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:84%
of San Francisco,
it also represents

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
the fulfillment of manifest
destiny-- the 19th century

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
belief in the inexorable
expansion of the United States

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:90%
from sea to shining sea.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
Here's a 19th century
painting depicting the goddess

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
Columbia leading
settlers westward

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
in an allegorical representation
of manifest destiny.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:10%
The Golden Gate is actually a
concept from, you guessed it,

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:10%
ancient Egypt.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.480 align:middle line:10%
Are you seeing the pattern here?

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.889 align:middle line:10%
They believe the Golden
Gate was the threshold

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:10%
souls must pass after death
on their way to the Duat.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:10%
You might be
interested, they also

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:10%
spoke of a silver
gate guarded by Isis,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:10%
the great mother of the sun.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:10%
Souls passing through the
silver gate on their journey

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:04.460 align:middle line:10%
from the divine source are
incarnated upon the earth.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:10%
I think Treasure Island
represents the silver gate

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:10%
guarded by Isis.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:10%
Its seven sides certainly
have her number.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the gift of incarnation
itself is the treasure.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:10%


00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:10%
The soul journeys westward
like the American settler

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:10%
and passes over Alcatraz,
one of the world's

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:10%
most famous prisons.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This fits with the Cathar
belief that the body

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:90%
is the prison of the soul.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.780 align:middle line:10%
All the while, angels--
this is Angel Island--

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:10%
fly above in a higher dimension.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:10%
Angel Island is a
state park and has

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.310 align:middle line:10%
incomparable views of the Bay.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:10%
The adjacent peninsula
is the town of Belvedere,

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:10%
one of the highest income
places in the United States.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
There may be a few angel
investors in Belvedere

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:84%
who take in the incredible
scenery and its symbolism.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:10%
After doing time upon
the earth, the soul

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:10%
passes through the Golden
Gate to meet its destiny

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:10%
in the Duat.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:10%
Now we are way out there.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.190 align:middle line:10%
Let's fly back to Giza and
get back down to the earth.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.930 align:middle line:10%


00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.520 align:middle line:10%
The pyramids of Giza
are said to be located

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the earth.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:10%
Jim Allison is an
independent researcher

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:10%
who's uncovered some
mind blowing geometry.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Here he's taken the
vesica piscis and laid it

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:90%
over the circle of the Earth.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:10%
Giza is at this point,
equidistant from the North Pole

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:10%
and the center of the Earth.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Quite a central location
when you see it this way.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.260 align:middle line:84%
In one of the oldest surviving
hermetic fragments called

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the Kore Kosmou, or
"Virgin of the World,"

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Isis has this to say
to her son Horace.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:84%
"But the right Holy
Land of our ancestors

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:84%
lies in the middle of
the earth, and the middle

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of the human body is the
sanctuary of the heart,

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and the heart is the
headquarters of the soul,

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and that, my son, is the
reason why men of this land

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:90%
are more wise.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It could not be otherwise,
seeing they are born and bred

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:90%
upon Earth's heart."

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.960 align:middle line:10%
The heart of Egypt would
have to be the Great Pyramid

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.800 align:middle line:10%
and it embodies
many more secrets.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's investigate a few more.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Here I've superimposed two
instances of the same 3D model.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:84%
When we draw a circle from the
center of the pyramid in plan

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to the tip of the
pyramid in elevation,

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:90%
something amazing happens.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:90%
We square the circle.

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The circumference
of the circle is

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.140 align:middle line:84%
equal to the perimeter
of the square.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a sacred diagram
that encodes much wisdom.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Mathematicians have
proven this diagram can't

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.510 align:middle line:84%
be drawn perfectly because
of the transcendental nature

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of pi.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Approximations are all that is
possible in a flat Euclidean

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:10%
In the book "The
Dimensions of Paradise,"

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:10%
John Michell has shown
how the first Pythagorean

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:10%
triplet is the key to the
wisdom encoded in this diagram.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:10%
Here 3-4-5 triangles
set the scale

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.740 align:middle line:10%
and make it a very
easy approximation

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.250 align:middle line:10%
for anyone to draw with
compasses and a ruler.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.440 align:middle line:10%
Now brace yourself
for the wisdom.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.620 align:middle line:10%
The moon and Earth
actually fit this diagram.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
The size of the moon
compared to the earth

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is as three is to 11
with a 99.97% accuracy.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid therefore
encodes the relative sizes

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:90%
of moon and earth.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The 3-4-5 triangle itself
contains a secret that unlocks

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.280 align:middle line:90%
yet more of the mystery.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.381 align:middle line:84%
The area of a 3-4-5
triangle is six.

00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Six is one of very few
perfect numbers in math,

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and is the only number in
the infinite sea of numbers

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:84%
which is both the sum and
product of the same three

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:10%
The number six is associated
with the macrocosm,

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:10%
which is everything
in the universe

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:10%
larger than the human scale.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.700 align:middle line:10%
There's a simple
mathematical realization

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:10%
that gets you from six to
720 that I'll skip over here.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:10%
Pause the video if
you love numbers.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:84%
When you scale the
original diagram by 720,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:84%
here's what you get--
the actual dimensions

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:90%
of the moon and earth in miles.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The diagram says the Earth's
diameter is 7,920 miles,

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's 99.9% accurate.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The diagram says the moon's
diameter is 2,160 miles,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:37.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's 99.94% accurate.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.570 align:middle line:84%
That's one precise
approximation.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:84%
John Michell called these
the canonical numbers

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:90%
for a good reason.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:84%
When we lay this diagram over
Stonehenge we see that it fits.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions of Stonehenge
match the canonical numbers,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:57.460 align:middle line:84%
but with a shifted decimal
place and in English feet

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:90%
rather than in miles.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:10%
St. Mary's Chapel in
Glastonbury is another structure

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:10%
Michell has found that
fits the canonical numbers

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.310 align:middle line:10%
in English feet.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.330 align:middle line:10%
According to the legend,
Saint Joseph of Arimathea

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:10%
left Jerusalem after
the crucifixion

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:10%
and traveled to the
Druid Isle of Avalon,

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:10%
where he built the
first Christian church.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:10%
This was later rebuilt
as St. Mary's Chapel

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:10%
in the 12th century.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Joseph of Arimathea is
mentioned in all four gospels

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.150 align:middle line:84%
as the wealthy man who donated
his own prepared tomb that

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.640 align:middle line:90%
became the Holy Sepulcher.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Some say Joseph of
Arimathea was Jesus' uncle

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because he acted like a
family member in this regard.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.190 align:middle line:10%
In any case, these
are the walls that

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:10%
remain from St. Mary's
Chapel, and here are

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:10%
its dimensions in English feet.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions fit the canonical
numbers just like Stonehenge.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
The original chapels ground plan
resonates with a double vesica

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.400 align:middle line:84%
piscis like we saw in the
analysis of the great seal

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Thinking of the
legend, I overlaid a 5

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
by 12 rectangle with x's
inside that we'll see later

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, and I
discovered that it closely

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:90%
fits the double vesica piscis.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there is truth to
the legend of St. Joseph

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:90%
of Arimathea after all.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
St. Mary's seems to bear
the stamp of the Jerusalem

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:90%
rectangle.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.710 align:middle line:84%
If shifting the decimal place
in the canonical numbers

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter then there
must be something special

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:90%
about the decimal system.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Consider Pythagoras'
motto, "all is number."

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:10%
The most sacred symbol in the
Pythagorean secret worship

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:10%
of number was the tetractys.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:10%
The diagram consists
of points arranged

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:10%
in four rows with one,
two, three, and four points

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.190 align:middle line:10%
in each successive row.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:10%
The tetractys symbolizes
the four elements,

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:10%
encodes pure musical intervals,
is the seed for understanding

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.850 align:middle line:10%
the harmony of the
cosmic spheres,

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:10%
and represents the
structure of space itself.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:10%
The sum of the points
in the tetractys is 10.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.380 align:middle line:84%
The decimal system we use
today, known as base 10,

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
utilizes nine digits
plus 0 as a placeholder.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word digit
comes from the Latin digitus,

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.300 align:middle line:90%
which means finger.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
We naturally assume
base 10 must have

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:84%
arisen from the practice
of counting on fingers.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Peter Plichta, who is both
a physicist and a chemist,

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.760 align:middle line:10%
has shown in his
book "God's Secret

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Formula" that there is much
more to the decimal system

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:10%
beyond the physiology
of our hands.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, the decimal
system hinges on the number 81.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:84%
To understand this, bear
with me for a moment

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and see how all the numbers
in the decimal system

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.180 align:middle line:90%
are hiding under 81.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Starting with the decimal
point, line up all the numbers

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:90%
sequentially like this.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:84%
The numbers beyond 9
are shown in parentheses

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because they are not
yet in the decimal place

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.430 align:middle line:90%
system of single digits.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Carrying each parenthesized
digit into the decimal system

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:90%
yields a repeating decimal.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:84%
This infinitely
repeating number is

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.310 align:middle line:90%
equal to the reciprocal of 81.

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:26.940 align:middle line:84%
All the numbers really
are hiding under 81.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
This is especially significant
because there are exactly

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:84%
81 stable elements in the
universe-- no more, no less.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.630 align:middle line:84%
The Periodic Table
of the Elements

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.630 align:middle line:84%
list the elements beyond 83 as
subject to radioactive decay,

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
but most are unaware of the
fact that unstable elements 43

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and 61 don't exist
anywhere in the universe

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.512 align:middle line:90%
unless they are synthesized.

00:43:52.512 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Plitchta was the first
to make this connection

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and also points out that all 81
stable elements are categorized

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.640 align:middle line:84%
into 10 types of isotopes,
which is another reference

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.620 align:middle line:90%
to the decimal system.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:10%
So Pythagoras was
right, all his number,

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and the numbers are in base 10.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:10%
Renna Shesso's book,
"Math for Mystics,"

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:10%
points out some
relevant spooky facts.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only does the moon
move through space

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.560 align:middle line:84%
81 times faster than
the Earth, but the moon

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:90%
has 1/81 the mass of Earth.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Am I alone in thinking
this is just too perfect?

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.990 align:middle line:84%
She also points out that
the magic square of the moon

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is a 9 by 9 square
having 81 numbers.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Magic squares go back at least
2,600 years to ancient China.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.730 align:middle line:10%
I get the feeling all of this
was known in the distant past.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.160 align:middle line:10%
While kids count to
10 on their fingers,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.400 align:middle line:10%
theoretical physicists
talk about 10

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:10%
dimensional super-strings
and Kabbalists

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.560 align:middle line:10%
talk about 10 sefirot
on the tree of life.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.840 align:middle line:10%
They are all recounting
the decimal structure

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:10%
of the universe from
different points of view.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Traveling a short distance along
the Nile we come to Dahshur,

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:84%
sight of the lesser known
Red and Bent pyramids.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists claim these
were contemporaneous

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:90%
with the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.460 align:middle line:10%
I think the sacred geometry
of both pyramids was correctly

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.976 align:middle line:10%
deciphered as
world-mysteries.com.

00:45:25.976 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids at
Dahshur hold keys

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to macrocosm and microcosm.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.980 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the
Red Pyramid isn't

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:10%
as steep as the Great Pyramid.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Its face proportions
match this red triangle

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.170 align:middle line:90%
within a pentagram.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Tilting up four such
triangles until the meet

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:84%
defines the pyramid
and its slope.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram is a
powerful magical talisman

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that was a symbol of
the Pythagorean school.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram encodes the
golden number phi within itself

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:58.960 align:middle line:90%
fractally.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Phi is one of the most
important numbers in mathematics

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
because nature uses it
to proportion everything

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.850 align:middle line:84%
from pine cones to sunflowers
and nautilus shells,

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:13.320 align:middle line:84%
even our bodies are based
on the golden section.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:10%
The number 5 is associated
with the microcosm with life

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:10%
and in the growth
of living things.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:10%
The adjacent Bent Pyramid
is the only pyramid

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.990 align:middle line:10%
with two slope angles.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The lower slope is steeper
than the Great Pyramid,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and its face proportions
match this blue triangle

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.030 align:middle line:90%
within a hexagon.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Tilting up for such
triangles until they meet

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:40.470 align:middle line:84%
defines the pyramids
lower slope.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The upper slope matches
the Red Pyramid,

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.760 align:middle line:84%
so it's red triangles
within pentagons again here.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So what's up with all the
hexagons and pentagons?

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It has been said that the
great enigma of alchemy

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:84%
is the mystery between
macrocosm and microcosm.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:10%
The word alchemy actually
comes from "Al Kemi,"

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.410 align:middle line:10%
which means the way of Egypt.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe relating six to five
is the essential key encoded

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.840 align:middle line:90%
at Dahshur.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.140 align:middle line:10%
Renaissance master,
Albrecht Durer

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.070 align:middle line:10%
made this drawing in his course
in the art of measurement

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.240 align:middle line:10%
with compasses and a ruler.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything emerges
from the vesica piscis.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Durer's Melancholia
One is one of the most

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:29.080 align:middle line:90%
studied pieces of esoteric art.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.280 align:middle line:10%
Franz Deckwitz presented the
following analysis in 1979

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.320 align:middle line:10%
to Jean Michell who published
it in his 1988 book,

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.582 align:middle line:10%
"The Dimensions of Paradise."

00:47:40.582 --> 00:47:41.430 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.580 align:middle line:84%
The opening of the
compasses is the key

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:90%
to the engravings metrology.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:84%
The compasses, sphere, measuring
stick, and overall proportions

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:90%
all fit the same unit.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.880 align:middle line:10%
As already mentioned, the
engravings proportions of 14:11

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.230 align:middle line:10%
match the Great Pyramids
half triangle proportion.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The objects in the engraving are
packed with hermetic symbolism,

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.810 align:middle line:84%
but the most
interesting thing to me

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is the hidden
controlling geometry.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.385 align:middle line:84%
It's the alchemical wedding
of pentagon and hexagon.

00:48:12.385 --> 00:48:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Schwaller de Lubicz did this
study of an Egyptian gateway.

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Notice the proportions of
sixes and fives in the opening,

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:25.710 align:middle line:10%
and the octave height of two
compared to the overall width

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:29.190 align:middle line:10%
of the fundamental one.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Henry Lincoln co-wrote
"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,"

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:84%
which became an inspiration
for Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Code" published more
than 20 years later.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.980 align:middle line:10%
In "The Holy Place,"
Lincoln revealed

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.760 align:middle line:10%
what he calls a structured
landscape in the former Cathar

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.600 align:middle line:10%
country surrounding the
mysterious village of Rennes Le

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.190 align:middle line:10%
Chateau.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Again we see the
marriage of six and five.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.250 align:middle line:10%


00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:56.690 align:middle line:10%
The pentagram over
the cube in DC

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:02.310 align:middle line:10%
is another representation of
six and five coming together.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.300 align:middle line:10%
Recall how triple
sixes and fives

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.680 align:middle line:10%
are encoded in the
Washington Monument

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:10%
as 6,660 inches equals 555 feet.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.870 align:middle line:10%
America's monumental
obelisk therefore

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:10%
expresses the relationship
between macrocosm

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.270 align:middle line:10%
and microcosm.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Moving to a larger scale,
the Earth encodes six to five

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:90%
in temporal and spatial terms.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.220 align:middle line:84%
The earth's precessional
cycle measured

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:33.040 align:middle line:84%
in years divided by the earth's
equatorial circumference

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.890 align:middle line:84%
measured in nautical
miles is precisely

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:90%
equal to six divided by five.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Alex B. Geddes
discovered relationships

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in the solar system that
express the macrocosm

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.390 align:middle line:90%
relationship to the microcosm.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:84%
These are published in John
Martineau's superb "Little

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Book of Coincidence."

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.420 align:middle line:10%
The relationships
Geddes found are

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.740 align:middle line:10%
ratios between the products of
mean orbital radius of planets

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:10%
More specifically the ratios
each equals six divided by five

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.220 align:middle line:10%
plus a small factor that
must be added in each case

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.200 align:middle line:10%
to balance the equalities.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:10%
Each product is a
symmetrical relationship

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:24.230 align:middle line:10%
between inner rocky planets
and outer gas giants.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I notice that each
one of the factors

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:84%
added to balance the
equalities encodes 864.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.800 align:middle line:10%
The same number you learned
in the Stonehenge and San

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Francisco episodes is
the number of the sun.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:10%
How incredibly apropos.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics,
phi and pi are two

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.370 align:middle line:90%
of the most important numbers.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They can be related
in the following way.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:10%
Six divided by five times
phi squared equals pi.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.360 align:middle line:10%
This equation is an extremely
accurate approximation,

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.810 align:middle line:10%
but is not exact and as such
is classified by mathematicians

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:10%
as a coincidence.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.220 align:middle line:10%
Are all of these things
just pure coincidence

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:10%
or evidence of
hyper-dimensional resonance?

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.170 align:middle line:84%
For a more complete
answer to that,

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll have to wait
for the Paris episodes.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.200 align:middle line:84%
For the next astonishing
example of sixes over fives,

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.574 align:middle line:84%
we'll visit the Holy
City of Jerusalem.

00:51:23.574 --> 00:51:24.374 align:middle line:90%
