00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>After reading
"The Last Symbol,"

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I was intrigued
with Washington, DC.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a city overflowing
with esoteric symbolism.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Zooming in from space as we
can in Google Earth, let me

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:90%
point out a few landmarks.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Here's the White House, Capitol
building, Washington Monument,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson Memorial, Lincoln
Memorial, and the Pentagon

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:90%
just across the Potomac.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Rick Campbell has uncovered
much of the underlying

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
geometry of the city on his
informative site dcsymbols.com.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Sees the following diagram in
the streets and interconnection

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:10%
of monuments.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:10%
The geometry consists of
a pentagram over a cube,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:10%
all contained within
an overarching pyramid.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these shapes carries
a meaning we'll be exploring.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:10%
We'll see later in Egypt
how the pentagram symbolizes

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:10%
the microcosm,
which is everything

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, human
scale or smaller.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
The cube is a recurrent
esoteric symbol for the body

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be running
into all over the world.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I found a pair of 3-4-5
triangles between the cube

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and the pyramid.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Turning off the cube layer,
you see the rectangle

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the
White House is also

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
made up of a pair of
interlocking triangles,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
this time with
5-12-13 proportions.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
3-4-5 and 5-12-13 are the
first two Pythagorean triplets.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:10%
As you'll begin to appreciate,
Pythagorean knowledge

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:10%
figures prominently in
decoding this mystery.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Where have we seen an
unfinished pyramid before?

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
On the back of the
dollar bill, of course.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:10%
If we eliminate the DC pyramid
with the same all-seeing eye

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:10%
of Providence, we are directed
to a specific building.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:10%
Is this the "eye
of Providence" we

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:10%
are looking at or its
older incarnation,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:10%
as the "eye of Horus?"

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Either way, what is behind
the all-seeing eye of the sun?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:10%
It's the headquarters of
Scottish Freemasonry, which

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:10%
goes by many names, including
the Supreme Council,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Mother Council of the World,
and House of the Temple.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:10%
This building is loaded
with Egyptian symbolism

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:10%
with a 13-step unfinished
pyramid on top,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:10%
just like on the dollar bill.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:10%
And two giant Sphinxes flank
the entrance out front.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
The architect John Russell
Pope modeled the 1911 building

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
after the Mausoleum
of Halicarnassus,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:90%
now a part of Turkey.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
As one of the seven wonders
of the ancient world,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
it served as tomb of King
Mausolus, which is where

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:90%
we get the word "mausoleum."

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:10%
The House of the
Temple correspondingly

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:10%
serves as tomb of Albert Pike,
sovereign grand commander,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:10%
Confederate general, and
the most famous Freemason

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:10%
of his times.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Pike wrote "Morals and Dogma,"
the handbook formerly given

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to new members up until
1974, which details

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:90%
the 33 ranks of Freemasonry.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:10%
The House of the Temple is where
the climax in "The Lost Symbol"

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:10%
takes place.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:10%
Campbell shows how
the elevation was

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:10%
designed to ad quadratum, which
is Latin for "by the square."

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:10%
Ad quadratum is a
sacred design template

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:10%
we'll see employed in the
District of Columbia itself

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:10%
and at Chartres Cathedral.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:10%
The sunburst above the entry
is at the center of the square,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:10%
and the top corner
marks the symbolic apex

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:10%
of the unfinished pyramid.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:10%
The bottom corner
presumably marks the crypt

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:10%
where Pike is interred.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Scottish Freemasons are
really into the number 33.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
There are 33 columns in
the House of the Temple

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:90%
that are 33-feet high.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the place where a
hardworking initiate can attain

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.196 align:middle line:84%
the highest 33rd degree from
the 33 members of the Supreme

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:18.996 align:middle line:90%
Council.

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:10%
33rd degree Masons are often
found in positions of power.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:10%
Many presidents of the United
States were Freemasons.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:10%
The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania
has a permanent exhibit

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:10%
featuring the
portrait and signature

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:10%
of each of these
presidents, with a record

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:10%
of their Masonic careers.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:10%
It is difficult to
verify Masonic membership

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:10%
because some members do
not make their involvement

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:10%
a matter of public record.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
However, each lodge
keeps its own records.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I find it interesting that
George Washington, Harding,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower, Carter,
and the younger Bush

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
all chose to be sworn into
the office of the president

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
with a hand on this Masonic
Bible dating from 1770.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
One has to be male and
believe in a supreme being

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to seek membership as
a Scottish Freemason.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
They insist their fraternity
is not a religion,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
although atheists are
ineligible for membership.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry is not
a secret society,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
but members are
strongly admonished,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
under pain of death, not
to reveal core secrets.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Much of what happens inside
the House of the Temple

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
has been pieced together
by outside researchers

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.716 align:middle line:90%
in recent years.

00:05:36.716 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:10%
And this has been
brought forward

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:10%
in Dan Brown's book
"The Lost Symbol."

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Members can rise
to the 32nd degree

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:90%
through hard work and study.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But only those selected
by the Supreme Council

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
may attain the
highest 33rd degree.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Richard Hoagland and
Mike Bara have dredged up

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the most interesting connections
between the Scottish Freemasons

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and NASA.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Here is Cape Canaveral
at Kennedy Space Center.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
These are the two
launch pads where

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
all the "Apollo" and space
shuttle missions left Earth.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Here is the single
runway, runway 33.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:10%
Of all the vectors they could
have chosen for the strip,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:10%
why did NASA's choose 33
degrees west of north?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:10%
If that seems like
circumstantial evidence to you,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:10%
how about this.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Here is astronaut Buzz
Aldrin, 33rd degree Mason,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:10%
on the moon holding the
flag of the Supreme Council,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:10%
which he later
brought back to Earth

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:10%
and gave to the
Supreme Commander

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:10%
of the House of the Temple.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
These examples show that
the Freemasons and NASA

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
are obsessed with this number.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering what's
so special about 33?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Where else does
this number appear?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is said to have
performed 33 miracles

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and to have died at age 33.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps this is no coincidence.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
That Bible says King David,
father of the famous Solomon,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
who built the first
temple in Jerusalem,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:90%
reigned for 33 years.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalah, or
Jewish mysticism,

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 sephiroth
in the Tree of Life

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
plus another hidden
one called daath.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Adding the 22 paths
between sephiroth

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
brings the total
up to the magic 33.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
My theory involves the
Schumann resonance.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the frequency at
which the Earth vibrates.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have measured the
standing wave at 7.83 Hertz,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
with a wavelength equal to the
circumference of the Earth.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
This inaudible low hum is
due to lightning discharges

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
in our conductive ionosphere,
causing the planet

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to actually ring like a bell.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:10%
If you do the simple
calculation, which

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:10%
I have done here
in a spreadsheet,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:10%
you'll see that middle C is
33 harmonics, or 32 overtones,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:10%
above the Schumann resonance.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:10%
Sound implausible?

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:10%
Think of it this way.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:10%
Our bodies resonate 33
octaves above the earth's

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:10%
fundamental vibration.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:10%
This fits with the ancient
Hermetic motto, "as above,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:10%
so below."

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I find it incredible that the
UN emblem divides the Earth

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:90%
into 33 sectors.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:84%
This has to be more
than coincidental.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
The human spinal column
appropriately has 33 vertebrae,

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
if you count the fused bones in
the lower spine individually.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:84%
33 might very well be
built into the architecture

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:84%
For further confirmation,
let's take a look

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
at the Great Seal of the
United States of America,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
as shown on the
back of a $1 bill.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the obverse
side of the Great Seal.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the side with the eagle.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Most important to our current
line of inquiry, let's

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
count the number of
feathers on the wings.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
The left wing has 33 feathers,
and the right wing has 32.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Could these refer
to the 33 harmonics

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
or 32 overtones just discussed
in relation to the Schumann

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:90%
resonance?

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I think Rick Campbell
has correctly decoded

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:90%
the controlling geometry.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Three circles with their centers
on each other's circumference

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
form a kind of double
vesica piscis, if you will.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
A vesica piscis
is formed whenever

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
two equally sized
circles come together,

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
such that their centers are on
each other's circumferences.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
A Star of David emerges from
the three circles' intersection

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Examining the reverse
of the Great Seal,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
we find the same
controlling geometry.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:10%
Look at the letters picked out
of the motto's "annuit coeptis"

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:10%
and "novus ordo seclorum."

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Never mind right now what
these mottoes signify.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:10%
The letters at the points
of the Star of David

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:09.355 align:middle line:10%
are A, S, N, O, and M.
Rearranging, we get Mason.

00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So to summarize, we've seen
how the House of the Temple

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
presides over a street
pyramid in Washington, DC.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:10%
There is a clear
Masonic connection

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:10%
to the office of the president,
NASA, and the United Nations.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:10%
The Scottish
Freemasons are obsessed

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:10%
with the number
33, which is echoed

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:10%
in the Judeo-Christian
tradition,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:10%
having a resonance both with
the human body and the Earth.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
It's no secret that Masons
trace their history back

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
through the Knights Templar.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed to discover there
is an urban village straight

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
across the Potomac from the
White House called Rosslyn.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers believe
one of the Templar factions

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
fled to Scotland after
the infamous raid that

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:90%
destroyed their order.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Rosslyn Chapel in
Scotland was the place

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
featured in "The Da Vinci
Code," where Sophie learned

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
she was a direct
descendant of Jesus

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and where she was reunited
with her bloodline.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Friday the 13th, October
1307 was the date

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
most of the Templars
got arrested, had

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
their considerable assets
seized, were interrogated,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and tortured to death by
agents of the French king,

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
acting in cooperation
with the pope.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:10%
Knowing the connections
between the Templars,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:10%
Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland,
and the Scottish Freemasons

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:10%
made me take a closer
look at Rosslyn, Virginia.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Rosslyn has two
important features--

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
a dense urban village and the
Marine Corps War Memorial.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:10%
So I drew a line from the
center of the Marine Corps

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:10%
Memorial in Rosslyn,
Virginia to the center

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:10%
of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:10%
You've got to love Google Earth.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The great circle
path passes precisely

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
over the apex of "eye of
Providence" and the entire DC

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
street pyramid,
arguably confirming

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:90%
my line of reasoning.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Before we leave
Scotland entirely,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
let's take a detour
to Edinburgh.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The Royal Mile is Edinburgh's
oldest and busiest tourist

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:90%
street.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:10%
If we measure a line from
the facade of Holyrood Abbey,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:10%
built in 1128 by King
David, I of Scotland

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:10%
to the circular tower
in Edinburgh Castle,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:10%
built by the same king,
we find that it measures

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:10%
almost precisely 8/7 of a mile.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:10%
The Royal Mile,
referred to in Edinburgh

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:10%
is therefore the Egyptian
royal mile by definition.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:10%
This is a memorable
and important unit

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:10%
because, as Richard Heath shows
in his book "Sacred Number

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:10%
and the Origins
of Civilization,"

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:10%
there are exactly 3,456 Egyptian
royal miles in the polar radius

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
King David built
these structures

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
right at the beginning of the
Knights Templars' existence,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
shortly after the Knights
returned from Jerusalem

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and the Gothic building
explosion began.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Could King David,
I of Scotland have

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
been connected to the knowledge
the Templars unearthed

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
from the House of
David in Jerusalem?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's return to Washington DC
and see how the royal mile is

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:90%
encoded there in plain sight.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Zooming into the area in
front of the Capitol building,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
many researchers have
identified Masonic compasses

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%
built into the street plan.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:10%
The compasses that run along
Pennsylvania and Maryland

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:10%
avenues point to the White House
and the Jefferson Memorial.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:10%
The spread of the compasses
is one royal mile.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:10%
I might chalk this
up to coincidence

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:10%
if it wasn't for the diagram
Richard Heath has published

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:10%
in "Sacred Number."

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Heath's diagram is drawn as a
grid of equilateral triangles,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
so every edge measures
one royal mile.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:10%
The Jefferson Memorial, White
House, and House of the Temple

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:10%
are centrally located
on these nodes.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The point of the Pentagon
facing the White House

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
is that this node.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:10%
This is simply too
much coincidence

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:10%
to have not been the product
of intentional design.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I find the ancient
Flower of Life diagram

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:90%
fits perfectly into this grid.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
The Flower of Life has been
found all over the world.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:10%
Wikipedia lists the Flower of
Life in 15 countries so far.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:10%
Here's the Flower of
Life at the Osirion

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:10%
Temple in Abydos,
Egypt, which is

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:10%
a minimum of 3,300 years old.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a little known fact
that Leonardo da Vinci even

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.861 align:middle line:90%
studied the Flower of Life.

00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the second depiction
of a cube we've seen in DC.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Metrology, the science
of measurement,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is one of the keys
to deciphering

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:90%
sacred architecture.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Each side of the larger
cube spans two triangles,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:10%
forming an edge length
equal to two royal miles.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
The polar radius of the Earth
is 1,728 times 2 royal miles.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
This equals the 3,456
royal miles referenced

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
by the Edinburgh Royal Mile.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:10%
The number 1,728 links DC with
the mythical "New Jerusalem"

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:10%
described in the Bible.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:10%
"And the city lieth
foursquare, and the length

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:10%
is as large as the breadth.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:10%
And he measured the city with
the reed, 12,000 furlongs.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:10%
The length and the breadth and
the height of it are equal."

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions of New
Jerusalem describe

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
a cube whose volume is
1,728 billion furlongs.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever wonder
why the US and Israel

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
have such a strong bond?

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:90%
DC is the New Jerusalem.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Here's the 1992 Israeli Supreme
Court building in Jerusalem.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Does this pyramid
on top containing

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:90%
a window look familiar?

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be the
"eye of Providence,"

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the same symbol found
in the streets of DC

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:90%
and on the dollar bill.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Many researchers have
seen the Tree of Life

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:10%
from Jewish mysticism encoded
in DC's traffic circles

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:10%
and monuments.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:10%
However, dcsymbols.com
is the only place

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:10%
that shows how the streets
and traffic circles match

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:10%
this early depiction of the
Portae Lucis Tree of Life

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:10%
from 1516.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The portal of light version
is shaped like an actual tree.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's where the
Tree of Life got its name.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Scott Circle's gently
curving streets

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
mimic the shape of
the Pythagorean Y.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:84%
In "The Secret Architecture
of our Nation's Capital,"

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
author David Ovason
says, "the Pythagorean Y

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is a vestigial drawing of a
path through life, in which one

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
is perpetually presented with a
choice of symbolic directions.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Should one do good or bad?"

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:84%
Scott Circle is in the position
in the Tree of Life known

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:90%
as daath the hidden sephiroth.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:84%
According to the Kabbalah,
the reason daath is depicted

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
as hidden is because humans who
remain selfish cannot see it.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Only those who orient themselves
in the service of others

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
are able to see the light
of daath, in which all 10

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:90%
sephiroth are united as one.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I think Scott Circle exemplifies
the sacred architecture of DC.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
it's plain to see once
you have the knowledge,

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
but remains hidden to
the general public.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Most people who know
the Tree of Life

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
are more familiar with the
Athanasius Kircher 1652, which

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is arranged in three columns.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:10%
The Kircher version is seen
here in John Evelyn's plan

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:10%
to rebuild London after
the Great Fire of 1666.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:10%
Both he and Christopher
Wren submitted plans based

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:10%
on the Tree of Life, although
Wren's wasn't as in-your-face

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:10%
as Evelyn's.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Neither were
actually carried out.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But it shows you this
kind of esoteric symbolism

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
wasn't anything new when
DC was laid out a century

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:90%
after the Great Fire of London.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:10%
As you've seen, there is a
deep connection to Judaism,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:10%
both in the Tree of Life
and in the metrology

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:10%
of Richard Heath's
larger cube that

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:10%
links Washington, DC
with the mythical New

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Jerusalem in the Bible.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:10%
To understand why both the
Flower of Life and Tree of Life

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:10%
are in DC, you need a
one-minute visual education

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:10%
in sacred geometry.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
The Flower of Life grows
on the Tree of Life.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Flower-of-Life geometry
is based on the 2D reality

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that six circles fit perfectly
around a central seventh, shown

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:90%
here with quarters.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:10%
Flowers eventually bear fruit,
and with a growth of circles,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:10%
we have the traditional
Fruit-of-Life diagram

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:10%
containing 13 circles.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Connecting the dots
reveals Metatron's cube,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:10%
an important diagram in the
study of sacred geometry.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It was named after
the biblical figure

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.735 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, who was transformed
into the Archangel Metatron.

00:19:42.735 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:10%
Metatron's cube contains
the five Platonic solids,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:10%
both in smaller and larger
scales, like a fractal.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Platonic solids
figure prominently

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
in Plato's philosophy,
after whom they were named.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:10%
The dots in the
interstices encode

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:10%
the pattern of two intersecting
Pythagorean tetractys.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the pattern
on the dollar

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:84%
bill in what is called "glory"
above the eagle's head.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:10%
Pythagorean swore an
oath to tetractys,

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:10%
which was the most important
symbol in their secret worship

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:10%
of number.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
All of this symbolism is
interconnected in a system.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Masons study for years to
understand these things

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and advance through
their degrees.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry is a remnant of
an ancient mystery school.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many lucky 13s are
on the obverse of the Great

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Seal.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen the 13 stars
of glory over the eagle's head.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
In the eagle's claws
there are 13 arrows.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.280 align:middle line:84%
13 leaves on the
branches hold 13 olives.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are 13
stripes on shield.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps having 13
colonies was no accident.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, the eagle only
has nine tail feathers.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
meaning in symbolism.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The 13th degree of
Scottish freemasonry

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is called the Royal
Arch of Solomon.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It's about Enoch, descent
into a vault, the arch,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
a triangle of gold, a cube of
agate, and the name of God.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Enoch supposedly
excavated nine chambers--

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
think of the tail feathers--
underneath the Temple Mount

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, one
below the other,

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:90%
each with a supporting arch.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
In the final chamber he
placed a cube of agate inset

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.865 align:middle line:84%
with a triangle of gold engraved
with the holy name of God.

00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:10%
By this sacred
geometry, Rick Campbell

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:10%
has shown Enoch's cube is,
in fact, Metatron's cube,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:10%
the triangle within the cube.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The name of God,
shown in Hebrew,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is called the
tetragrammaton, the most

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
sacred four-letter
word in Judaism.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:10%
The letters of
the tetragrammaton

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:10%
are traditionally shown in
the Pythagorean tetractys

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:10%
because it encodes the
Shemhamphorasch, or names

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:10%
of God, which in Jewish
mystical tradition corresponds

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.386 align:middle line:10%
to 72 arrangements of
the four holy letters.

00:22:16.386 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The practice of assigning
numbers to letters

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:90%
is called gematria.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:10%
Here we see how the
letters in Enoch's triangle

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:10%
in code the number 72, the
number of names of God.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
When you get deep enough
into most religions,

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:84%
you eventually
encounter a belief

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:90%
in the sacredness of number.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was supposedly transformed
into the Archangel Metatron

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
when he was 365
years old, his age

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
being an obvious
solar reference.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:10%
Speaking of solar men being
elevated to the divine,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:10%
let's look at the
Capitol Building Rotunda.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This center point of
American democracy

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
figured prominently in Dan
Brown's "The Lost Symbol."

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Investigative
mythologist William Henry

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:10%
has interpreted the significance
of the Capitol building

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:10%
as the solemn temple at
the heart of America.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Looking up through the
oculus and the Capitol Dome,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
we see Constantino
Brumidi's huge fresco

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
entitled "Apotheosis
of George Washington."

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The word "apotheosis" means
elevation of a man into god.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
George Washington is
sitting on a rainbow

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
up in the clouds,
surrounded by 13 maidens

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and flanked by the goddesses
Liberty and Victory.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Henry has dug up
what was probably

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi's inspiration
for depicting

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Washington riding on a rainbow
in front of a stargate.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Here is Jesus doing the same.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Both are man-become-god.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The fresco at the
heart of America

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
clearly elevates Washington
into some kind of solar deity.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Six allegorical groupings
in a hexagonal arrangement

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
tell stories centered
on the ancient gods

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, Vulcan, Ceres,
Minerva, Neptune, and Columbia.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
What does all this
pagan symbolism

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the official
history of the United States?

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
There are 72 stars
surrounding the fresco,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
recalling the names of God
in Jewish mystical tradition.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
An astronomical take
on this number of stars

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that it takes
72 years for the Earth

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:90%
to precess one degree.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We'll be learning more about
the precessional cycle in Rome.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Looking deeper, there are
several crypto references

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptian goddess
Isis, particularly

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in the "Allegory
of Agriculture."

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Flora, with exposed breast, and
young America, in liberty cap,

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
stand in front of Ceres,
Goddess of Agriculture.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
A sheaf of wheat is often
used to depict the Goddess

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%
of Nature, shown here as Virgo.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
An exposed breast
and the liberty cap

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
are well-known attributes
of Isis, used extensively

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%
during the French Revolution.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Here the symbols
are shown together

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
in Delacroix's "Liberty
Guiding the People."

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:10%
The goddesses personified on
both sides of the Atlantic

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:10%
as Nature, Reason,
liberty, Freedom,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:10%
and Colombia are all
esoteric references

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:10%
to the Egyptian goddess Isis.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:10%
Here's a silver
dollar showing Liberty

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:10%
with a liberty cap on a pole.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:10%
This particular coin happens to
be worth well over six figures

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:10%
The seal of the US Senate
shows the now-familiar red cap

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
To top it off, the
Goddess Freedom

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:84%
on the outside of
the Capitol Dome,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and recently in the middle of
the Capitol Visitors Center,

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:84%
are yet more depictions
of you know who.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The architects of the
Capitol are clearly

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with the
secret worship of Isis.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Following the Goddess
Liberty upward,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we see how the entire
District of Columbia

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
was originally surveyed by
George Washington in 1791.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.360 align:middle line:10%
The mile markers are
placed ad quadratum, just

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:10%
like the elevation of
the House of the Temple,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:10%
built more than a century later.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
This later organic interruption
in the lower portion

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of the square became
Alexandria, Virginia.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient world, Isis
had an important temple

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:10%
on the Island of Pharos just
outside Alexandria, Egypt.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:10%
Pharos was the location of
the Lighthouse of Alexandria,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:10%
wonder of the ancient world.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The light that shown from
it was the "Stella Maris,"

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
star of the sea, one of
the many epithets for Isis.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:10%
The highest point in
Alexandria, Virginia

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:10%
has a replica of the
ancient lighthouse

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:10%
in the form of the George
Washington Masonic National

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Memorial.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
George Washington, and many
of the founding fathers,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:84%
were, of course,
well-known Freemasons.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:10%
Pay special attention to
the three cubes forming

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:10%
the body of the lighthouse.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:10%
We'll see this symbolism
again in London

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:10%
and finally decode it in Paris.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:10%
How is it that we keep finding
secret connections to Isis

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.870 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Egypt in a country
that has no ostensible reason

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.425 align:middle line:10%
to make this symbolic linkage?

00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:10%


00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Believe it or not,
Pennsylvania Avenue

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:10%
is astronomically oriented to
the heliacal rising of Sirius.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians
based their calendar

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:10%
on this phenomenon,
which is the day when

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:10%
Isis's star, Sirius, is
visible on the horizon

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:10%
just before sunrise.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:10%
From the White House
in early August,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is visible a few
minutes before sunrise directly

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:10%
behind the Capitol building.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of
the Capitol building,

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
sunset on this same
day passes straight

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
down Pennsylvania
Avenue and sets over

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the apex of the pyramid atop
the National Post Office.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:10%
If you overlay a pair of
pentagrams over the Capitol

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:10%
building, a couple of
interesting things occur.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:10%
These edges follow Pennsylvania
and Maryland avenues,

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:10%
and RFK Stadium from
961 is framed perfectly

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:10%
in the crook of the
opposing pentagram.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I noticed four radiating streets
above and below the Capitol

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Then it clicked
with the pentagrams,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and I see what is
actually depicted here

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:90%
is the Templar cross.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Can there now be any doubt
who is behind the program

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:90%
of symbolism in DC?

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:10%
The Templars may be long gone,
but the Scottish Freemasons

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:10%
remain active today.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:10%
We'll learn more about the
Templars at Chartres Cathedral

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:10%
and again in London.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:10%
David Ovason's
groundbreaking book

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:10%
"The Secret Architecture
of Our Nation's Capital"

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:10%
reveals that DC has more zodiacs
than any city in the world,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:10%
concentrated in what is
called the Federal Triangle.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:10%
The Federal Triangle contains
many important governmental

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:10%
structures, including
the National Archives,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:10%
the National Post Office,
the Departments of Justice

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:10%
and Commerce, and so on.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:10%
Most importantly, Ovason shows
how these Federal Triangle

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:10%
zodiacs draw attention to one
constellation in particular,

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:10%
Virgo.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:10%
Virgo the Virgin is an esoteric
representation of Isis.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Ovason's research
into Masonic symbolism

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.410 align:middle line:10%
led him to map the stars
Arcturus, Regulus, and Spica

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:10%
to a terrestrial triangle
connecting the White

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:10%
House, Capitol
building, and the point

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.276 align:middle line:10%
where many think the Washington
Monument was supposed to be.

00:30:03.276 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, the Washington
Monument is shifted slightly

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to the east with respect to
the White House, Jefferson

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Memorial, north-south axis.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:10%
Some claim this shift
was due to the fact

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.980 align:middle line:10%
that the marked
point is on landfill,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:10%
and the site where the
monument was actually built

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:10%
is on solid ground.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:84%
In any case, here is that
particular stellar arrangement

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:90%
brought down to earth.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.890 align:middle line:84%
We see Virgo over
the Federal Triangle

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and Leo over the
Capitol building.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:38.420 align:middle line:84%
18th century Masonic French
astronomer Jerome Lalande

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
wrote, "the Virgin is
consecrated to Isis,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
just as Leo is consecrated
to her husband, Osiris."

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So Isis is linked with the
Federal Triangle and Osiris

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:90%
with the Capitol building.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:10%
The Virgin's right hand
points to the White House,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:10%
but her left hand is actually
on the Washington Monument.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:10%
This is very interesting to
those who know the Isis story.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Could Isis be holding Osiris's
golden phallus in the form

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:10%
of the Washington Monument?

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:10%
As the ancient
Egyptian story goes,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:10%
it all started when Set
became jealous of his brother

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:10%
Osiris, who was
King of all Egypt,

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:10%
and his girlfriend was
the beautiful Isis.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Set then deceived
and killed Osiris,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:10%
cut his body into 14 parts,
sealed all but one of them

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.830 align:middle line:10%
in a coffin, and sent
it down the Nile.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
As a final insult, he
Osiris's penis into the river.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:10%
His sister consort
Isis was at length

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:10%
able to recover and magically
reconnect all of Osiris's parts

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:10%
except for his penis, which was
unfortunately eaten by a fish.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Isis fashioned a golden
phallus, attached it to Osiris,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:10%
and brought him back
to life with a song.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
From this experience,
the resurrected Osiris

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:90%
became Lord of the Dead.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:10%
Isis was impregnated
with the golden phallus,

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:10%
and their son Horus grew
to become God of the Sun.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.420 align:middle line:10%
It's the original story of sex
and violence, jealousy, incest,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:10%
and pregnancy.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The Washington Monument is
an obvious phallic symbol.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:10%
The vesica piscis paths
surrounding the obelisk

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.400 align:middle line:10%
suggest female genitals.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Taken together, the
symbols represent

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:10%
the joining of Osiris and
Isis and the conception

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:10%
of the Sun God Horus.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe you think I'm
going too far at this point.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But take a look at what is
above the elevator that goes up

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the shaft of the Washington
Monument, the same ride

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Robert Langdon took at the
end of "The Lost Symbol."

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:10%
Right above the
elevator doors there

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:51.100 align:middle line:10%
is a bronze sculpture of
George Washington, sculpted

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:10%
by French Freemason
Houdon, and above that

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:10%
is the winged disk of Horus.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:10%
What in the world does
this Egyptian solar symbol

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:10%
have to do with America?

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.220 align:middle line:10%
It's a clue to the secret
meaning of the obelisk

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:10%
in the most public of places.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:10%
But how many actually
see it and understand?

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:10%
The dimensions of the monument
are all sixes and fives.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:21.120 align:middle line:10%
What an amazing coincidence that
6,660 inches equals 555 feet.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.980 align:middle line:10%
We'll decipher the meaning
of sixes and thighs in Egypt.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:10%
The Washington Monument
is not a true obelisk cut

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:10%
from a single piece of stone.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:10%
Instead it is both
literally and figuratively

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:10%
a monumental work of masonry.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Bernard I. Pietsch's
meticulous metrological study

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:10%
of the Washington Monument
reveals a sacred diagram

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:10%
projected on the earth.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:10%
Based on the exact height
and angle of the pyramidion,

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:10%
its face and ridge lines
project down to the ground

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:10%
and trace circles that are
proportioned ad quadratum

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:10%
with respect to each other.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The diagram shown here is
called the octagram star

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.540 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a symbol used in many
religions and cultures

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll briefly trace the
octagram star through history

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.710 align:middle line:90%
to uncover its meaning.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:10%
The earliest example I've
found that has this symmetry

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:10%
is the Star of Inanna,
the Sumerian goddess whom

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:10%
I think all the Isis obsession
is ultimately based on.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:10%
Archeologists identify
the Sumerian culture

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:10%
as the oldest
civilization on Earth.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Sumeria predated ancient Egypt,
but it wasn't even discovered

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:84%
until 1890, so that must be why
most esoteric references are

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
to Isis rather than Inanna.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend reading
the collected works

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.239 align:middle line:84%
of Zecharia Sitchin
for an alternative,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
albeit controversial, theory
on the origins of civilization.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's another
documentary entirely.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I have found the octagram
star in many other places

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The Hindu star of Lakshmi
is a pure octagram star.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian Ogdoad add adds a
central cosmic egg to the mix,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:90%
containing the Sun God Ra.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:10%
The structure of
the Celtic calendar

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:10%
resonates with
the octagram star.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:10%
The Gnostic
theologian Valentinus

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:10%
transformed Egyptian
concepts into Christian ones

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:10%
in his second century cosmology
featuring the Pleroma,

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.640 align:middle line:10%
or godhead, in the center.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhist wheel of Dharma
has this as its symbol,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:10%
incorporating the
eightfold path.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:10%
Islam uses the Rub el
Hizb his as its symbol.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Found in the oldest Qurans
as a chapter marker,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:10%
here it is expressed fractally
in Muhammad's Tomb in Medina.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:10%
The Eastern Orthodox Church
used octagram star symmetry

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:10%
in numerous depictions
of Christ Pantocrater

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:10%
and in the Transfiguration.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Even the seemingly
unrelated Aztec culture

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:84%
produced their calendrical
Piedra Del Sol, having

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:90%
this remarkable symmetry.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:10%
Finally, the Vatican also
encoded this powerful symbol

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:10%
in St. Peter's Square.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptian
obelisk at its center

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.290 align:middle line:10%
is literally a gigantic sundial
with stones in the pavement

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:10%
marking the seasons.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So the octagram
star is resoundingly

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.530 align:middle line:84%
a solar symbol, appropriately
fitting the male obelisk,

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the primary reading
of the Washington Monument.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:84%
However, female energy
is not entirely neglected

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
in the Washington Monument.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We've already seen how
a stretch vesica piscis

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:90%
symbol surrounds the obelisk.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Rick Campbell has
brought something

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:90%
even more hidden to light.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
If you draw a vesica piscis
to scale with the circles'

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.740 align:middle line:84%
diameters equal to the height
of the Washington Monument's 555

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:84%
feet, the Great Pyramid
of Egypt fits perfectly

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:90%
inside the vulva.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:90%
This is no accident.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:10%
That architect who designed
the Washington Monument

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:10%
must have wanted to secretly
link it with the Great Pyramid.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid and
the Washington Monument

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
both have phi in
their proportions,

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
most interesting numbers

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.200 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.930 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I noticed
in Washington, DC

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:84%
propelled me on a virtual
journey around the world.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember the pair of
interlocking triangles

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.830 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the White House?

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:10%
It struck me that the
horseshoe-shaped lawn

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:10%
in the White House
backyard looked a lot

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.410 align:middle line:10%
like the bluestone
ring at Stonehenge.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:10%
That got me thinking how
these two triangles together

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:10%
form of by 5-by-12
rectangle that

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:10%
has the same proportions
as the station

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.970 align:middle line:10%
rectangle at Stonehenge.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Following this
hunch, I drew a line

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:10%
from the tip of the
Federal Triangle

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:10%
to the center of Stonehenge.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:10%
Later on, I happened to
zoom into New York City

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.030 align:middle line:10%
when this layer was on and saw
that the alignment perfectly

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.200 align:middle line:10%
bisects Central Park.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:10%
That's probably not an
accident, so here we go.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:10%
The angle that this large-scale
alignment takes through Central

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:10%
Park matches the interlocking
Pythagorean triangle's

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.100 align:middle line:10%
hypotenuses.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Four such triangles match
Central Park's proportions

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:10%
of 5-to-24 precisely.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:10%
I then wondered, what is this
unusual aqueduct doing just

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:10%
under the surface of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis Reservoir?

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:10%
It seems to mirror the
triangle's hypotenuse angle.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:10%
That's certainly odd.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:10%
But in my research,
I've learned to follow

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:10%
so-called "coincidences"
wherever they lead.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:10%
The aqueduct leads us to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.420 align:middle line:10%
Getting closer still,
we see this variation

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:10%
of the Templar flag in the
atrium of the Robert Lehman

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:10%
Collection.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.420 align:middle line:10%
Incidentally, Albrecht
Durer's esoteric masterpiece

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:10%
"Melancholia I" is
in this collection,

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:10%
and we'll study it in Egypt.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:10%
In case you're thinking I'm
imagining connections where

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.620 align:middle line:10%
none exist, right outside
this room is one of the oldest

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:10%
artifacts in North America, a
3,500-year-old Egyptian obelisk

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:10%
from Heliopolis.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:10%
Note the octagonal surrounding
yet another solar symbol.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:10%
There are only a handful of
ancient Egyptian obelisks

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:10%
left in the world, even
counting those still in Egypt.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:10%
So when I see one, I
sit up and take notice.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.660 align:middle line:10%
This is the twin of
Cleopatra's Needle in London.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian temples typically
had paired obelisks

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
at their entrances.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So the obelisks now
in New York and London

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.090 align:middle line:84%
used to together
frame the entrance

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:90%
to a temple in Heliopolis.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a difficult
and expensive project

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century,
and even today,

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to transport a 224-ton
slab of granite

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:90%
halfway across the planet.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Connecting nations
with ancient Egypt

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.510 align:middle line:84%
was apparently a very powerful
motivator to the Freemasons

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:84%
who bothered moving
these obelisks.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Overlaying the
floor plan, we see

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:10%
what the aqueduct is
pointing to-- literally

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:10%
an ancient Egyptian
temple within the Sackler

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:10%
wing of the Met.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:10%
The Temple of Dendur had to be
removed from its original site

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.630 align:middle line:10%
in order to save it from being
submerged by the construction

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:10%
of the Aswan High Dam.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:10%
In 1965, the government of Egypt
presented the temple as a gift

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:10%
to the United States, which
was ceremonially represented

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.030 align:middle line:10%
by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:10%
That's quite a coincidence,
considering the aqueduct

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:10%
and Jackie's reservoir led us
to the very temple she received.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Was the former first lady
playing the role of Isis?

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:10%
While we're in New
York, let's take a look

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.370 align:middle line:10%
at one of the most
famous tourist spots

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:10%
and greatest symbols
of America and visit

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.840 align:middle line:10%
the Statue of Liberty.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:10%
The authors Graham
Hancock and Robert Bauval

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:10%
have researched the
Statue of Liberty,

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:10%
and you might be surprised
what they have found.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:10%
French sculptor and
well-known Freemason Bartholdi

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:10%
designed the colossal statue
originally for the opening

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:10%
of the Suez Canal in 1867.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.140 align:middle line:10%
Fellow Freemason Gustav Eiffel,
who was later made famous

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.830 align:middle line:10%
for his Parisian
tower, was commissioned

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:10%
as the statue's engineer.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.780 align:middle line:10%
It is said Bartholdi modeled
the sculpture after the Roman

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Goddess Libertas.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, Libertas was an
echo of the Egyptian goddess

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Isis.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:10%
After Bartholdi's
colossus was rejected

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:10%
for the Suez Canal due
to financial reasons,

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:10%
he repurposed it as the Statue
of Liberty for New York Harbor.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.710 align:middle line:10%
It comes as no surprise
that the cornerstone

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:10%
for the Statue of Liberty was
laid in a Masonic ceremony.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:10%
Researcher Jim Allison
has connected to the dots

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:10%
and identified the triangle
between Giza, Pharos,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:10%
and the opening
of the Suez Canal.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:10%
The angle of this
triangle matches the slope

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.070 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid and
looks like the Greek letter

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:22.380 align:middle line:10%
delta, which beautifully
echoes the Nile delta.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The Colossus of Rhodes
was one of the seven

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:90%
wonders of the ancient world.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The giant statue that stood
on the Island of Rhodes

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
depicted Apollo, God
of the Sun, who also

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:37.140 align:middle line:90%
wore a crown of seven rays.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Seven rays is very
interesting in light

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:84%
of the culmination of
the initiation ceremony

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.660 align:middle line:90%
into the cult of Isis.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.370 align:middle line:84%
According to 19th century
author Edouard Schure,

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:84%
after a successful
initiate survived

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
all the harrowing tests and
triumphed over death by fire,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
water, and temptation
of the senses,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.370 align:middle line:84%
he was led into an
inner sanctum, where

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.430 align:middle line:84%
he looked upon a colossal
metal statue of Isis, crowned

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.870 align:middle line:90%
with a diadem of seven rays.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe seven is
Isis's secret number.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Isis's son Horus
was God of the Sun,

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
just as Apollo depicted
in the Colossus of Rhodes

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.540 align:middle line:84%
was God of the
Sun to the Greeks.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:10%
You'll see that the Statue
of Liberty's base star

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:10%
is quite odd, having 11 points.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:10%
I think this was done
to make the number

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:10%
symbolism in the
Statue of Liberty

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:10%
fit an important Egyptian
structure, the Great Pyramid

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:10%
of Giza, whose height-to-base
proportion is 7-to-11,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.860 align:middle line:10%
like the famous
convenience store's name.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't get
11 from the base star,

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.010 align:middle line:84%
the height of the statue
from heel to top of head

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:90%
is 111 feet, 1 inch.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So it all fits now.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:84%
You see how the
Statue of Liberty

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:84%
secretly depicts the
Egyptian Goddess Isis.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.190 align:middle line:10%
Extending the line of
the submerged structure

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:10%
in the reservoir that lead
us to the Temple of Isis

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:10%
all the way to
the East River, we

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:10%
are directed to the United
Nations headquarters

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.050 align:middle line:10%
in midtown Manhattan.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The iconic Secretariat's
Building proportions

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.570 align:middle line:90%
are based on phi.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
As you know, this proportion
links the structure

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:26.650 align:middle line:84%
with the Washington Monument
and the Great Pyramid.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:30.090 align:middle line:10%
Did you know the
69,000-square-meter site of UN

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:34.030 align:middle line:10%
headquarters is considered
international territory and is

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.810 align:middle line:10%
technically not a
part of New York City?

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:10%
The UN headquarters has
its own security force,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.180 align:middle line:10%
fire department, and
postal administration that

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:10%
even issues its own stamps.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.440 align:middle line:10%
The notion of UN headquarters
being a city within a city

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.420 align:middle line:10%
reminds me of how the Vatican
is also a city within Rome.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to refer to
this as a nested city

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.740 align:middle line:90%
or fractal structure.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated to discover
that the Italian government

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
donated an Arnaldo Pomodoro
sphere-within-sphere sculpture

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to the UN in 1991.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The golden ball beautifully
represents the concept

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
of a city within a city.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:84%
The internal
structures seem to me

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:84%
like buildings and streets
on the inner surfaces

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.310 align:middle line:90%
of the spheres.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:24.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm intrigued because I've seen
three other similar sculptures

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:10%
in locations significant
to my research.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.280 align:middle line:10%
Pomodoro made a series of
six spheres-within-spheres

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:10%
scattered around the world.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Significant
sphere-within-sphere locations

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.790 align:middle line:84%
are the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.470 align:middle line:84%
in DC, very close to the
Capitol building; the De Young

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Museum in San Francisco; and
in the Vatican's courtyard

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.730 align:middle line:90%
of the Belvedere.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll be visiting the latter
two locations in due course.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:10%
The Security Council Chamber
is the emergency room

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:10%
of the UN, where
decisions involving

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:10%
economic sanctions and military
action are sometimes made.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Notice the
horseshoe-shaped desk,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.500 align:middle line:10%
surrounding 13 chairs located
at a rectangular table

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:10%
in the center.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:10%
The red chairs flanking
the central group

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:10%
are arranged in rows of 13.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.300 align:middle line:84%
All these lucky 13s are
reminiscent of the many 13s

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.040 align:middle line:84%
on the Great Seal of
the United States.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The mural in the
Security Council Chamber

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.320 align:middle line:84%
is by Norwegian
artists Per Krogh,

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and it contains some highly
interesting symbolism.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The left-arched panel shows
a woman opening a window,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.230 align:middle line:84%
letting in rays of
golden sunlight.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The right-arched panel shows a
man letting a white horse run

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:90%
before the full moon.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.340 align:middle line:10%
Sun and moon are symbolized
in Masonic lodges

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:10%
by the columns of
Boaz on the left

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.870 align:middle line:10%
and to Jachin on the right.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:10%
Boaz and Jachin originally
stood in Solomon's Temple

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.620 align:middle line:10%
in Jerusalem.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:57.230 align:middle line:10%
Boaz symbolizes the sun
and Jachin the moon.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:10%
We'll see the symbolism again
in the Towers of Sun and Moon

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.540 align:middle line:10%
at Chartres Cathedral.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The vesica piscis shape
in the center of the mural

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:84%
contains the story
of Original Sin.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Young Adam and Eve
stand in the background.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer, hanging from serpentine
vines in the Tree of Knowledge,

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.120 align:middle line:90%
hands Eve the infamous apple.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Years pass, and Adam
and Eve are shown

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.540 align:middle line:84%
with arms interlocked, closer
to the center of the vesica

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.150 align:middle line:90%
piscis.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:84%
In time, they're
first born, Cain,

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is shown in the foreground
at his parents' feet.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.730 align:middle line:10%
This unmistakable
imagery is strange,

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.920 align:middle line:10%
to say the least, in
a chamber representing

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.080 align:middle line:10%
all the nations of the world.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:10%
The mural symbolizing the
security of all nations

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:10%
should probably embrace
all cultures and religions,

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:10%
but it clearly has a distinctly
Judeo-Christian subtext.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to look
closely to perceive it,

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.610 align:middle line:84%
but there is a faint
circle representing the sun

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the vesica piscis.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Tiny flames can
be seen emanating

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:84%
from the circle, which
carry through four

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.440 align:middle line:90%
of the mural's panels.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Here the sun, or son, emerges
from the center of the vesica

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:90%
piscis, or womb.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The bird below the vesica
piscis is a Phoenix,

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
standing over the
ashes of its parent.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.290 align:middle line:84%
The phoenix is a symbol
of transformation

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and of the cyclical
nature of time.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus recorded the fact
that this mysterious bird has

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.855 align:middle line:90%
ancient Egyptian provenance.

00:48:28.855 --> 00:48:31.860 align:middle line:84%
"There is a sacred bird
called the phoenix.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen it
myself except in pictures,

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:84%
for it is extremely
rare, only appearing,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:84%
according to the
people of Heliopolis,

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.400 align:middle line:84%
once in 500 years,
when it is seen

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:90%
after the death of its parent."

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The beast of war is shown slain
in an underground crypt, run

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.560 align:middle line:90%
through with a sword.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The abandoned
artillery, machine gun,

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and soldier laying
down his rifle

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:84%
show this is the end of
the Second World War.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The UN was chartered at the
end of this conflict in 1945,

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the war imagery
is entirely appropriate.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Souls, or shades, in
between life and death,

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.960 align:middle line:84%
literally in monochrome,
are being helped up

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.620 align:middle line:84%
from below on both
sides of the mural.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Shades on the solar left
side are tinted gold,

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and shades on the
lunar right side

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.320 align:middle line:90%
are appropriately tinted silver.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.560 align:middle line:84%
The original motto of the French
Revolution "liberte, egalite,

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.840 align:middle line:84%
fraternite, ou la
mort,--" "liberty,

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.340 align:middle line:84%
equality, brotherhood,
or death--"

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.650 align:middle line:84%
surprisingly maps to much
of the remaining symbolism.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Souls being lifted with
ropes up into the light

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.150 align:middle line:90%
are gaining their liberty.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The scene in the upper
left shows a group

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of people weighing grain,
presumably to distribute it

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:90%
with equality.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The party in the two panels
surrounding the vesica piscis

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.410 align:middle line:84%
illustrates brotherhood,
with all types

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.500 align:middle line:84%
of people and children
happily united,

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.070 align:middle line:84%
holding cyan ribbons
and UN flags.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Those souls who
died in the war are

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:84%
lining up and entering
the starry door of death

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.146 align:middle line:90%
behind the phoenix.

00:50:09.146 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
"La mort" was later dropped
from the revolutionary motto

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because it reminded people too
much of the Reign of Terror.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.800 align:middle line:10%
The tricolor flag of
the French Republic

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:25.410 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes the three-term motto,
"liberte, egalite, fraternite."

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The scene in the upper right
shows scientists investigating

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:33.520 align:middle line:84%
the macrocosm and microcosm
with telescope and microscope.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.560 align:middle line:84%
The two upper panels
hold a political message,

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.970 align:middle line:84%
with the depiction of people
painting, planting, designing,

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
playing music, singing,
writing, and dancing.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I think the
implication is humanity

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:84%
may enjoy these higher
pleasures after a war has been

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.740 align:middle line:84%
transformed, like a
phoenix, into peace

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.250 align:middle line:84%
through the agency of
the United Nations.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.250 align:middle line:10%
The symbolism in
the mural contains

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:10%
Judeo-Christian, Masonic,
French revolutionary,

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:10%
and ancient Egyptian imagery
that became apparent only

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.780 align:middle line:10%
under careful analysis.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.780 align:middle line:10%
The mural is more than a
small decorative element.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.980 align:middle line:10%
It dominates the
Security Council Chamber.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.520 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, I think the choice of
symbolism embedded in the mural

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:10%
tells us something about the
character of the United Nations

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.000 align:middle line:10%
I find the hidden connections
to Masons and Egypt

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:10%
most provocative.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Contemplating the United
Nations got me thinking

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:90%
about national symbols.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Consider the UN flag as a symbol
of nations coming together

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in peace.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:84%
As I already mentioned, the
map is divided into 33 sectors.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems appropriate
that the Earth

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is flanked by two olive
branches, symbolizing peace.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Each of these branches
contains 13 leaves.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.420 align:middle line:84%
The UN flag is cyan
in color and was

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:84%
created after the UN
was chartered in 1945.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:03.400 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, the UN decided
to partition Palestine

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:84%
into a Jewish state, an Arab
state, and a UN-administered

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.090 align:middle line:84%
This decision led
to a series of wars

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately Israel's
independence in 1948.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.770 align:middle line:10%
The coat of arms of Israel
is also cyan in color.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.640 align:middle line:10%
It seems appropriate
that the menorah

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:10%
is featured because it's
been a symbol of Judaism

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.050 align:middle line:10%
for almost 3,000 years.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:31.210 align:middle line:10%
The menorah is flanked
by two 13-leafed olive

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.150 align:middle line:10%
branches, symbolizing
peace, another parallel

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.730 align:middle line:10%
with the UN flag.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.560 align:middle line:84%
There are many countries
whose flags and coats of arms

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.710 align:middle line:84%
feature olive branches
symbolizing peace.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.330 align:middle line:10%
However, only the UN emblem and
the coats of arms of Israel,

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.520 align:middle line:10%
the United States, and
the US Virgin Islands

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.620 align:middle line:10%
feature olive branches
having exactly 13 leaves.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The US Virgin
Islands coat of arms

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.710 align:middle line:84%
is a modified version
of the Great Seal

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The flag of the United
States of America

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:07.320 align:middle line:84%
also features significant
numerical symbolism.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.980 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 red
and white stripes.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.090 align:middle line:84%
50 stars are arranged
in nine rows,

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.280 align:middle line:84%
alternating between rows
of six and five stars.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll learn the significance of
the nine rows in San Francisco

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.835 align:middle line:84%
and the alternating rows of
six and five stars in Egypt.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:26.635 align:middle line:90%
