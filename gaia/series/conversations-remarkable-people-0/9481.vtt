>> The year, 1934, and
America, deep in the throes

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
of a crippling depression, is
captivated by an ugly custody

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:10%
battle for poor, little rich
girl, Gloria Vanderbilt,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:10%
and her $5 million inheritance.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
In one corner, her high
living socialite mother.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
In the other, her concerned
aunt Gertrude Whitney.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle,
jeered at by crowds,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
hounded by the press, a
lonely 10-year-old girl.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And while her aunt
Gertrude may have won,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.975 align:middle line:90%
Gloria was a little girl lost.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Gloria Vanderbilt, once storm
center of a sensational court

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:90%
battle, is going on 13 now.

>> Passing isolated adolescence
before escaping into an abusive

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:90%
marriage at just 17 years old.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Gloria would marry two more
times, to conductor Leopold

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Stokowski and
director Sidney Lumet,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
before finding her true love,
screenwriter Wyatt Cooper.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
With Cooper and sons,
Anderson and Carter,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
she created the family she'd
spent a lifetime searching for.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
she enjoyed success

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
as a painter and a writer.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But Gloria's happiness
was short-lived.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:10%
In 1978, she lost Wyatt after
a series of heart attacks.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
In characteristic style, her
pain did not keep her down.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Gloria poured her
energies into what

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.695 align:middle line:84%
would become her most unlikely,
but wildly successful venture--

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:56.495 align:middle line:90%
blue jeans.

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> These pants fit
you everywhere.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> By the late '70s, Gloria's
trademark swan was in more

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
American women's closets with
her jeans outselling every

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
other brand.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, once again,
the unthinkable.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
In July 1988, with
Gloria watching,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
her son Carter disoriented,
confused, crept out

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
on the ledge of their
penthouse balcony

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and jumped 14
stories to his death.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
This time, Gloria
dealt with her pain

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
by writing "A Mother's
Story," a tale of loss

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
focusing not just on Carter,
but the myriad losses

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%
experienced just in living.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I never do anything or
approach anything without

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
believing it's going to
be absolutely successful.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't hesitate.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the minute you do,
you'd end up doing nothing.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Conversely, its message
is hopeful, strong,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and pure Gloria.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
No matter how terrible
the loss, no matter

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
how much you think you can't
go on, you can, you should,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
you must.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> In your most remarkable
book, "A Mother's Story,"

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
you begin with the words, "Some
of us are born with a sense

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of loss.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not something we acquire.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It is with us from
the very beginning.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it pervades us for
the rest of our lives."

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are born
with a sense of loss.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's true of me, yes.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.405 align:middle line:90%
>> What does it mean for you?

00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:36.655 align:middle line:90%
What does that loss feel like?

00:03:36.655 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it really
comes from not having a father,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and my mother, who was
very elusive and really

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, you are forever
trying to replace it, find it.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's just an irrevocable--

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:10%
loss is the thing that is
the most motivating thing

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in my life and always
has been, and trying

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
to replace that
loss, trying to find

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:10%
something that will assuage it.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:10%
>> What were some of the ways
that you tried to fill that

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.015 align:middle line:10%
hole?

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I never, ever--

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
one of the qualities and
the traits that I hate more

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
than anything is self-pity.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly never had that.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't respect
people that do.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But I always felt that I
was trying to find something

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't have.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
as one develops,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and if you live long enough,
you find that, in a sense,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
you become your own mother
and your own father.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But that takes a
long, long time.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That doesn't come
early or easily.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly is the point
that I've really reached now.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that--

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
well, loss is the thing
that still is the thing that

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
obsesses me most, and that I
think about most in my writing,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to
find in my work,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.295 align:middle line:84%
I try to find in a love
affairs, one tries to find.

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things you
wrote that resonated with me

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
for so long was with each
successive loss in your life,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:90%
it became more familiar.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was almost
a relief, you said.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I can deal with loss very
easily because I've been there

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and I'm familiar with it.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes, it's almost
oh, yes, this is something

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that I can really
handle and that I

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
can function with because
I've been there before.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There's sort of a
fascination with it too.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
when you're a child,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
you fall and you skin your knee.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And your mother says,
don't touch the scab.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can't help it,
it's so fascinating to you.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that is true.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I was talking the other
day with my son Anderson

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about two relationships

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:90%
that I have in my life.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.565 align:middle line:90%
And Anderson said, well, mom--

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
these are not the
names of the people--

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
why would you want
to be happy with John

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.915 align:middle line:84%
when you can be
miserable with Bill?

00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is sort of
in the same genre

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
for what we're talking about.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.595 align:middle line:90%
>> And what was your answer?

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought
about it a lot.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, really,
what is it that I want?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Do I want that feeling
of being miserable which

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, also a
feeling of loss and all that.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Or do I want to be happy?

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.731 align:middle line:90%
Interesting question.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a fascinating
question, my new friend.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a fascinating
question because I

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
think we do have a
tendency to do that.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
There are people who go to
the familiarity of pain.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> My mother, who I'm
endlessly obsessed with,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and to this day I'm
obsessed with her,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and she was the most
elusive, beautiful,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
like a butterfly that I tried to
catch and I couldn't and I was

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:90%
always chasing her.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't it interesting, the
relationship between a mother

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and a daughter, because
on so many levels,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
they are who we
model ourselves--

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's "My Mother/My
Self" is Nancy Friday.

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Nancy Friday's book.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
--because in some cases,
they represent everything

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that we draw away from
that we don't want to be.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
they are everything.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have friends
who have daughters

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and their relationship, it's
so tempestuous and they go

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
through-- and I never really had
that because I really never had

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
my mother.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The custody case
happened when I was nine.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't see her
again for a long time.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So my role models were
really movie stars.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I was obsessed with the movies.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.116 align:middle line:84%
Katharine Hepburn was somebody
that was sort of a role model.

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
oh, I wish she was

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.511 align:middle line:90%
my mother, that kind of thing.

00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You made headline
lines when you were what?

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
6, 7, 8 years old with
that custody battle?

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there are pictures
of you where even then,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:90%
there's a sadness about you.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.757 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of loss in
pictures of you as a little--

00:09:36.757 --> 00:09:37.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:38.357 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:38.357 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> --little girl.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Were you aware of the loss then?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was so
happy with my--

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful nurse who was
really a mother image to me.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
separated from my nurse,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
my nanny, which was
really, absolutely

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
was the worst thing that
had ever happened to me.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
But until then, I was happy.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I often think, in looking
back on my custody case,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
if Mrs. Whitney,
my aunt Gertrude,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
had only taken
the money that she

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
spent on the lawyers
and various other things

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and given it to my mother, who
would have been happy, I think,

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to go to Europe and live,
and let me stay with my aunt

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.866 align:middle line:84%
and had my nurse
stay on, and then

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
eventually, my
mother and I would

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
have gotten to know each other.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.995 align:middle line:84%
That would have really
been the solution to it.

00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a strange thing,
isn't it, how as time passes,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
even though they're not around,
that's when we get to know

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.525 align:middle line:90%
and understand our mothers?

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh,well, well, my
relationship with my mother

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.075 align:middle line:90%
keeps changing every day.

00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:51.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Today, even?

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> How is it changing?

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think about
her all the time.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, I understand
her better, more.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel that way
about my grandmother.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel that way about
the nurse I had.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that way
about Leopold Stokowski,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
who has died, and who
I was very much in love

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:84%
with and very close to
at one time in my life.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:90%
But my relationship with--

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
it keeps changing all the time.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your relationship
with your mother today?

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Is she someone you love?

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Is she someone you forgive?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:39.218 align:middle line:84%
>> I would love to see her
and have her in my life.

00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:42.564 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:47.822 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.822 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> While Gloria Vanderbilt was
born into a family of wealth,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:84%
prestige, and power, her
life was never an easy road.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Informed at every turn by loss--

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
of her father, her mother,
her true love, her child.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Through it all, she did
hold onto one thing--

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.506 align:middle line:84%
faith-- in herself
and in a higher power.

00:12:15.506 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You must have an enormous
amount of faith in your life.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.045 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:10%
>> How would you define
your faith today?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:10%
I think we all have different
definitions of spirituality,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:10%
of the road we walk down
that centers us, focuses

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:10%
us, and allows us to have
an essential conversation

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:10%
with God.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:38.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.985 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you define
your faith today?

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm very fatalistic.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
everything is preset.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
that, it frees you,

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to happen the way

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
it happens, and it's not going
to happen in any other way.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that gives me great--

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I also don't believe that
this is the real life,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and that this is just the
transition to something which

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
is going to be much better.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Much, much better.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.355 align:middle line:84%
And don't ask me how I
know it, I just know it.

00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:27.155 align:middle line:90%
>> I won't.

00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I won't ask you, because
you know-- and I'll tell you

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
why I won't ask
you, because I think

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that's what faith
is, just knowing.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just a knowingness.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So you believe things
are choreographed for us.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:41.575 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You believe that there are
better things and a better

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:90%
place coming.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.935 align:middle line:90%
Do you pray?

00:13:48.935 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time?

00:13:53.660 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I pray-- what I really pray
is I thank the divine mother

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
for what I have, and my health,
and that my children are OK,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and my friends.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't ask for things.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.585 align:middle line:90%
>> I just thank for what I have.

00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> A very wise, holy person said
to me once that the best way

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
to pray is not in supplication,
asking for things,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
but in gratitude.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what I believe too.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> If America has royalty,
people would say royalty--

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Kennedys, the Vanderbilts.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that
embarrasses me very much.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure it does.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.012 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know, that's--

00:14:52.012 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it might, but
people would say that.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask you,
what does it feel

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
like to have that
kind of celebrity?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
To be watched?

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
To be studied?

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:90%
To be scrutinized all your life?

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.685 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When the custody case
happened, and I was nine,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I got an enormous
amount of publicity.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And I decided--

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether I
articulated it as I do now--

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
but I just thought, I
don't want to read anything

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
about myself because I want
to make something of my life.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I rarely do read
anything about myself.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think of myself--

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't read
reviews of my books.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't read interviews.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I may look at this
interview, I may not.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
No, because the
minute you do it--

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.552 align:middle line:90%
I like to keep clear.

00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then let
me ask you this,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that there is
a consciousness of celebrity?

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean,
a responsibility

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
have, an awareness,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
the things you do

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
are watched by people,
the direction you take.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And people take a
lot of direction

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
from what you do because
you are in the public eye.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you behave responsibly
because your name has never

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:90%
been in the mud?

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And you've been a
celebrity for a long time.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't again,
think really in those terms.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't do what I do
any other way than the way

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that I do it, and
the way I live.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.105 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think--

00:16:58.105 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.080 align:middle line:84%
see, I don't see myself
as a celebrity if--

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --you want to use that word.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
getting that kind of publicity

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
as a child that is, I think,
difficult is that people do--

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:90%
it casts a long shadow.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:90%
You hear that name, or that--

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
preconceived sort of thing

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:90%
that follows the person.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And it really takes your whole
life to become someone worthy

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
of self-respect as a person,
not with that shadow of--

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.755 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:17:47.755 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful American
actor by the name of Robert

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Loggia.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me a
story about years ago.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I
auditioned for a play,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
"Orpheus Descending,"
with Gloria.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we were
both very young.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
She walked onto the stage
and the stagehand stopped,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and the director stopped, and
the other actors auditioning

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:90%
stopped.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
Chantal, I don't know

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.136 align:middle line:84%
how to tell you except she
had a presence about her.

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know
whether he remembers this,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
but Tennessee Williams--
we were auditioning for--

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and Tennessee was
the terror of actors

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
because he would always
sit like in the second row

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and he would talk throughout
the actors' auditions.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
only thing I remember.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So if he thought I had
presence dealing with that,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%
and he certainly did.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.926 align:middle line:90%
So but that's very, very funny.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I will remind him.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Tennessee really was,
he was just a terror.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
He would always have somebody,
an assistant or something,

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and he would be talking,
talking, talking, talking

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.790 align:middle line:90%
through the audition.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Now you see what you've done?

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You've successfully taken
the subject off of you

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and your remarkable presence.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it is
when someone has presence?

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think you probably,
if you've got it, you know it.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.455 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
projects itself.

00:19:29.455 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
this wonderful thing

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
about Marilyn Monroe, which
I'm sure you've heard this,

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:90%
but she could be--

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember I had a party one
night and Marilyn was there.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
days when she had

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
come to be in the Actors
Studio and all that.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And she was going around
without any makeup on.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.042 align:middle line:90%
And she came to the party.

00:19:56.042 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And she had on a sort of
army-navy sweater and no makeup

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and just a little
Vaseline on her eyelids.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And John Groth, the artist,
was coming to the party

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
dying to meet her.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.186 align:middle line:84%
So he arrived and he
said, where's Marilyn.

00:20:11.186 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, she's out
on the terrace.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.352 align:middle line:84%
So he went out on
the terrace and there

00:20:16.352 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
were some other people there.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was out on the terrace
talking to Dick Avedon.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And he came back and he
said, no, she's not there.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't recognize her.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's true.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:10%
She could go and be in Central
Park at the zoo, having coffee,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:10%
and if she wanted
to turn it on, she

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:10%
could suddenly be Marilyn
Monroe and everybody

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:10%
would recognize her.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But if she didn't want
anybody to recognize her,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.935 align:middle line:84%
she could absolutely
fade into landscape.

00:20:46.935 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it has
to happen up here,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:90%
that thing of presence.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I promise this will be
the last time I embarrass you

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
in this interview.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:10%
But I have to tell
you this because it

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:10%
gets in the way of the
conversation for me.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:90%
You are so beautiful.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to say anything.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Your face, you truly are a
beautiful, beautiful woman.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if beauty was important
to you, is important to you?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, passionately important.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:10%
But what kind of beauty
are we talking about?

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm really talking
about all beauty.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Beauty in nature, beauty in
surroundings, beauty of color,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:90%
beauty of everything.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, beauty
is absolutely one

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
things in the world.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It's food.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What about personal beauty?

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.016 align:middle line:84%
Like your face, as
I look at it now,

00:22:06.016 --> 00:22:07.265 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're just exquisite.

00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:10.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Aw, Chantal, I
don't know what to say.

00:22:10.075 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> You are.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me do this.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Let me do this.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really quite overwhelmed.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go to girl
talk right here.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to girl talk.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
My mother always said
to me, no matter what,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your
life, never go to bed

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
with mascara on because
that's a great beauty tip.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I never have.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm 53 years old--

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think that's--

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --don't do it.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --a very good tip.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.487 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your tip?

00:22:34.487 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, you're
talking physically now--

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.194 align:middle line:84%
>> --not any
meditation or anything?

00:22:39.194 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm going to get
to meditation in a minute.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But the physical tip, something
you've done all your life.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
This is important to me
because I'm going to do it.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.837 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, I mean,
I wash my face with soap.

00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>> [GASP] No.

00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:56.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> People say you're not
supposed to wash your face with

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:90%
soap.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I drink lots of water
which I think is important.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I just sort of hang in there.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I just sort of hang in there.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
You look like this.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:90%
You look like this.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Was it important growing up
as an actress and a model?

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, my mother, of
course, was a great beauty.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
And she was an identical twin.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:10%
And they were both absolutely
the most beautiful creatures

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:10%
you could imagine.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course,
wanted passionately

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to merge with my mother, and
be her, and look like her,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you feel beautiful?

00:23:48.445 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what I have works
for me, I'll put it like that.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And I've always felt that.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is I have, it works.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to look any
other way than the way I look,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
not that I think it's
perfect, because I don't.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:90%
But whatever it is, it works.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Meditation.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
kind of thing that

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.515 align:middle line:84%
contributes to beauty, because
there is a spiritual beauty as

00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:19.315 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:24:19.315 --> 00:24:20.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:20.115 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a calming.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a centering.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.074 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:24:25.074 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a
mantra in your life?

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I have--

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And my mantra really
is what I believe

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:84%
it takes to be
successful in whatever

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.270 align:middle line:90%
work you decide you want to do.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you say it for me?

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes courage.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It takes believing in it.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It takes rising above it.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
It takes work.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.405 align:middle line:84%
It takes me liking
you and you liking me.

00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It takes the dreaming
soul of the human race

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:90%
that wants it to go right.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's never stop dreaming.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most important
things, I think, in all of that

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:90%
is, it takes rising above it.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think
of all the things

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to deal with when
you're in a working situation,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
in any situation,
and to know what

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to let go, and not
let it hold you back,

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.115 align:middle line:90%
and that takes courage.

00:25:42.115 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And with that, let's talk
about Carter for a few minutes.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you do
with all of the--

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
what if I had said this?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
What if I had done that?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:90%
What if I had just been--

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the terrible
thing that you live with every

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And you just have to again, as I
believe that things are preset,

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and that I think there's
a reason that it happened,

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that anything happens, and that
we don't understand it yet,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:90%
but someday we will.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's positive.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I think it's OK.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:90%
But that torment that one puts--

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I know it well.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.055 align:middle line:90%
I know it well.

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure you do.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very, very
difficult. And with time,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
cliche though it is,
it does get better.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It'll be 12 years that
I lost Carter in July.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
you think you're never

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
going to laugh again
or really live again.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:90%
But you do.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that
you don't really recover,

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:84%
but you laugh again,
you live again.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
first time you laughed--

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:14.506 align:middle line:84%
felt something and
thought, I haven't laughed,

00:27:14.506 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I haven't laughed in so long?

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.548 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember coming
back into the world?

00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:25.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Slowly, but
very, very slowly.

00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people, when something
like this occurs in their life,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
they think, I cannot
go to a support group.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I cannot--

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.246 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:27:35.246 --> 00:27:36.046 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:36.046 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> --talk to another person.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:90%
No one will understand.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
For the people
watching this broadcast

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:48.800 align:middle line:84%
who are in that position
now, please talk to them.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.675 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:27:49.675 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think really,
it's such a personal thing.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And some people
cannot communicate.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
They're very locked
into themselves

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and can't break
out of themselves

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and are afraid of showing
that terrible grief and pain.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But it really makes
such a difference.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And you feel this
incredible closeness

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.400 align:middle line:84%
because you're with people
you don't have to explain,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to talk.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to even say
anything if you don't want to.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend and
she lost her son.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And she sometimes goes with
me to the support group,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:90%
and she never says anything.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.720 align:middle line:90%
She just listens.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
But it helps her to
be able to do that.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't feel it,
if you don't want to do it,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't do it.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Just give it a try, maybe
once, to see if it would work.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the best advice in
the world-- just go once--

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Once.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:52.626 align:middle line:90%
>> --what can it hurt?

00:28:52.626 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, you can go
and after five minutes,

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:90%
you can just get up and leave.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
There's no pressure
at a support group.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
There's no feeling of, it's
going to be silly if I get up

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and walk away.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that at all.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You can just do
anything that you want.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever go through
a period of, it's my fault?

00:29:14.015 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so good.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I think so many people--

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:90%
No, that, I never did.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It must be of great comfort
to you to know that Carter knew

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.465 align:middle line:90%
and was sure that he was loved.

00:29:36.465 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:90%
And I know he loved me too.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> He fell 14 stories.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you write, you
stand outside a building

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:90%
and you count 14 stories up.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I think it's very
important to go over it again,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and again, and again, and again.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way that
you come to assuage pain.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to do that.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.741 align:middle line:84%
I know some people,
they want to forget it

00:30:21.741 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to deal with it.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But that is not the way
I have chosen to do it.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand
exactly why you do it.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
For me, it would be a way
of putting chaos into order.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be a way of
wrapping my head around it.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I go over it a lot
again, and again, and again.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I even, like a movie,
play it backwards.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I did that a lot, actually,
in the very beginning.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:02.217 align:middle line:84%
And then when it was happening--
because he didn't jump,

00:31:02.217 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:90%
he was holding on to the--

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Hanging onto the ledge.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --ledge, and for a minute,
I thought he was going to come

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:90%
back again--

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and as it was happening, I saw--

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
it was as if I went
up into the sky

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and was looking
down on the balcony

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.299 align:middle line:90%
with two people on the balcony.

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that,
actually, that's

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
a rather common
thing when somebody's

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
in an accident or
something, you get a sort

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
of out of body experience.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But and I go over the
whole thing a lot.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to do it.

something you read,

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
something that
gives you comfort,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:84%
something that you read
over and over again?

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.980 align:middle line:10%

thing from Willa Cather's "My

it applies to what we're talking

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:15.255 align:middle line:10%
about, but it's how I
imagine death to be.

00:32:15.255 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'll read it
to you, shall I?

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.406 align:middle line:84%

I was something that lay
under the sun and felt it,

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:90%
like the pumpkin.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%

is sun and air, or
goodness and knowledge.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:05.820 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, that is happiness,
to be dissolved into something

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:90%
complete and great.

Carter were so close.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And after Carter died,
I thought it was as if--

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to explain it--

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but I was so happy
that, if it had

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to be that it was me there
instead of him, because he

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have survived it.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.605 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't have.

00:35:10.605 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Sidney Lumet?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Sydney's wonderful, yes.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The warmest, most passionate,
generous, spirited, person.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I love him dearly.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Remarkable man, Sidney.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Leopold?

00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he was a
genius, is a genius.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And geniuses are not
easy to live with.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.395 align:middle line:90%
>> I imagine he was not.

00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:40.015 align:middle line:84%
>> But I was just
crazy about him.

00:35:40.015 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, they say that there
is a common thread in the men

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.210 align:middle line:90%
we love.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though their personalities
may be very different,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a common
denominator, aside from you,

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.170 align:middle line:90%
of course, that they have.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
What was a quality,
do you think,

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.495 align:middle line:84%
that all the men
you've loved have had?

00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they were
all so different.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't find it, except
that they loved me a lot, which

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.960 align:middle line:90%
is a thread, I guess.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lovely thread.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Someone once said,
it's very important

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.805 align:middle line:84%
to have a man love you a little
bit more than you love him.

00:36:24.805 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I don't
think that's true.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think that's true?

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I think all love,
even if it's unrequited,

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:90%
even if it's all--

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> When you write about Wyatt,
you say he was the one true

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:90%
real love.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when
love is the real love?

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, you
do think that every love,

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:84%
or you hope every
love, is the real love.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:06.945 align:middle line:84%
So and you can't know until
you've met the other love.

00:37:06.945 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.840 align:middle line:90%
At the time, he's the one.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> At the time, he's the one.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.476 align:middle line:84%
>> He may not be Mr. Right,
but he's Mr. Right now.

00:37:14.476 --> 00:37:15.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But my marriage to Wyatt was
the most steady and real.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:29.825 align:middle line:84%
And I would be married to
him today if he hadn't died.

00:37:29.825 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The other day I was with
a group of girlfriends and we

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
when we date men,

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
non-negotiables we have.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And by non-negotiables, we
mean there's just a few things

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:90%
that there's no arguing about.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
For me is, you can't smoke
and you've got to love dogs.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two
non-negotiables for me.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:84%
What would be
non-negotiables for you?

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, smoking would
certainly be one.

00:37:56.846 --> 00:37:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What about a
man who's stingy?

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, stinginess
I cannot hate--

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.667 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I really hate it.

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing
to do with somebody

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:90%
whether they have money or not.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain
generosity of spirit.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of men
who do have a lot of money

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:90%
are very stingy.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And I can't stand it.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about a
very important topic.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about friendships.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have the most
intense friendships with--

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I have about 10 women friends.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so blessed
because I trust them.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:90%
They trust me.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd do anything in
the world for them.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And I know they would for me.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I trust women much more
than I do men, which I think

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
is probably because I was
brought up by women, really.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't a clue about men.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I haven't a clue.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I have four boys, was
meant to have daughters.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, it's worked out OK.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.265 align:middle line:90%
But I haven't got a clue.

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if we'll ever
really understand men?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think they probably
are as sensitive as we are,

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:90%
only I don't know, I find it--

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%
it's another territory.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.210 align:middle line:90%
It's another country, you know?

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.665 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
men are another tribe.

00:39:25.665 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.125 align:middle line:90%
>> They are another tribe.

00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But they feel that
way about us, so--

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And they're entitled.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:90%
I have a bold question.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:39.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when you were
friends with Truman Capote.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> People have said over the
years that he was a mean man.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Was he-- would you?

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Truman, what happened
to Truman in the beginning,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I knew him when we
were both like 18.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to Truman
is he got into the drugs.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what did it to him.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:02.380 align:middle line:90%
He was a drug addict, got to be.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And then he completely changed.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And I think he was mean.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see him at all
in the last years of his life

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.670 align:middle line:90%
because he was--

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%
well, I didn't trust him.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just think he did
really betrayed, really,

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.130 align:middle line:84%
his real friends
like Babe Paley and--

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Slim Keith.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Slim Keith, yeah.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You came out
of that unscathed,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.480 align:middle line:84%
as I read about
that over the years.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if it was just
that you were wise enough

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to step away.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, I never, ever--

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I never confided him in anything
that I wouldn't want everybody

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to know about, because he
was a brilliant gossip.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And he also, he said
to me once, if you

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:56.710 align:middle line:84%
want to repeat something,
gossip about somebody,

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:59.580 align:middle line:84%
he said, and you
want to make it up.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to take just a little
grain of truth about the person

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:84%
so that when you
tell the rest of it,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:90%
they're going to believe it.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the way
his mind worked.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And I never, ever trusted him.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
He was a wonderful companion
and great fun to be with,

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:90%
but not to confide in.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What made you wake
up one morning and say,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll do jeans?

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was when
I was in the design--

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and I started out in home
furnishings, designing.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
The first fashion thing
I did was scarves, which

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:90%
were done for my paintings.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And from that, I went
into my own business

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
on 7th Avenue, a
couture business.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And from that, one of
my licenses was jeans.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It really took off, very big.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you miss that world?

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm out of the business
completely, happily, yes.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.500 align:middle line:90%
No, I really don't.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The best thing about
it was making a lot

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.520 align:middle line:90%
of money, which is always nice.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
in that business,

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you really don't have
time to write or to paint.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
mechanism, it's

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.640 align:middle line:90%
another thing that's going on.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do I get the feeling
that making a lot of money,

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.180 align:middle line:84%
to use that phrase, is not as
important to you right now as I

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:90%
sit here with you?

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, the only good thing
about making money is it gives

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
you independence,
that's what it does.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the best
thing about it.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a red tableau.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a thanks
to the divine mother

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.380 align:middle line:90%
for saving a child's life.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Ever the independent
spirit, Gloria, now in her 70s,

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is entering a new phase in her
artwork with box sculptures.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What one relates to is
absolutely connected with

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:84%
one's childhood because that's
the way the story of it all

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:90%
comes together.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Somewhat abstract, but
always containing kernels

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:90%
of the autobiographical.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the themes I notice
in a lot of your artwork is

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:29.216 align:middle line:90%
the divine mother.

00:43:29.216 --> 00:43:30.340 align:middle line:90%
And you speak of her a lot.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that important?

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:38.725 align:middle line:84%
>> For Gloria, her life is
never far from her work.

00:43:38.725 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The divine mother has more
reality to me than a male

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:90%
image, than a male figure.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think also that if you've
always longed for a mother,

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and searched for
a mother, it is as

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.860 align:middle line:84%
if you have a mother,
if you pray to her

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.572 align:middle line:90%
or feel connected to her.

00:44:05.572 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that
there are no endings.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
are beginnings.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:12.445 --> 00:44:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Every day, there's
a new beginning.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Every day, there's a new
chapter in our lives.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So I ask you as we
close this conversation,

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.110 align:middle line:90%
what are you beginning?

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What do you begin in this
chapter of your life?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.100 align:middle line:90%
What are you beginning?

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.732 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to be a surprise.

00:44:37.732 --> 00:44:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't it funny, you
have a preconceived notion,

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought you would say,
well, I'm doing this and that.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose it's
better in life

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.334 align:middle line:90%
to say, put it in front of me.

00:44:47.334 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I really learned after
Carter's death that you just

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.790 align:middle line:10%
don't know.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up with hope, and
love, and passion in your heart

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.166 align:middle line:90%
and hope for the best.

00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, the best compliment
that I think one woman can give

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:84%
another woman is not I love your
shoes, I love your lipstick,

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:90%
who did your hair?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I think the best compliment one
woman can give another woman is

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.630 align:middle line:90%
to say, I want to be like you.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to have the
qualities that you have.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.860 align:middle line:90%
And I say that to you.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Chantal, really, it's--

00:45:38.385 --> 00:45:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.785 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
lovely conversation.

00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sweetheart.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> You are delightful.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.
