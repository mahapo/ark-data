some 37 years ago.

at her apartment,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and walked up to a French little
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

about two or three hours.

And we had a wonderful
time, lots of laughs.

00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And actually, at the
end of that evening

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I told her that I was going to
eventually ask her to marry me.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%

loved her, Don Robinson,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
there was still
something missing.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about him.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:10%

we really have to decide if

I can't-- can you at least
be engaged for six months?

Because if we can try a
six-month engagement--

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and in the back of
my mind, I never

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
said yes to him because I
had this nagging feeling

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that somewhere this was
not going to be my life.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So when he finally
said, call it, I said,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.834 align:middle line:84%
yes, for heaven's
sake, let's do it.

were parties given for us about

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.619 align:middle line:10%
our engagement.

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And there were about four or
five parties given for us.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:10%
And I remember this
one particular party

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:10%
we went to together,
and Dolores seemed

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.689 align:middle line:10%
distant for the first time.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And she was at kind of
one end of the room,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.671 align:middle line:90%
and I was at the other.

00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I thought something
was strange, something

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
was on her mind,
something serious.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were coming back
from an engagement party.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped in the middle of
the road, and he said, Dolores,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
do you love me?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, of
course I love you, Don.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.377 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So we drove a little further,
and then he stopped and he

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:90%
said, Dolores, do you love me?

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Don, what
is this, St. Peter?

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I love you.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:90%
What are you-- and he said, no.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, you were
not there tonight.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:90%
You weren't there.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Dolores wasn't
there that night.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
she flew to the Abbey,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
where she was about to
make her final decision.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So I called Don and
I told him, I said,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I just have to tell you
that I'm in Connecticut,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and the guest house told
me I could stay for a week.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I really think I
have to really think over

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:90%
what it is we're doing.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I walked up to
a central part of our property

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a
blizzard that afternoon.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew, I said before
God, whatever I had to do,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.511 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to have
the strength to do it.

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Mother, is that
when you had what

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
would be called your
essential conversation

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
with God, where you make
a decision to devote

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:90%
your life to Him?

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Was that the beginning
of that conversation?

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure, yes.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
essential conversation

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.492 align:middle line:84%
was the one that I had with
the abbess when I came back.

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
She just said to
me, well, Dolores,

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to do?

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want to give
my life completely to God,

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
but I have a house, I have
a life, I have a career.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.435 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so therefore, it
doesn't seem possible, does it?

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:90%
And she sat for a few minutes.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Dolores,
what do you want to do?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, I think God--

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and she said, no, I
don't want to know

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:90%
what God wants you to do.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
you want to do.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell me
what you want to do,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
then we can talk
about God, and we

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:84%
can talk about your husband,
your house, your career.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:90%
But let's start with you.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I want
to give my life to God.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
It was only a few hours later
that it came back to me,

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to tell Don?

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Soon after
Dolores arrived home,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
she found the strength
to tell Don the truth.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We went to a
restaurant and had dinner.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And the restaurant
was very crowded,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:84%
so they seated us out in the
middle of the restaurant.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, well, what
decision have you come to?

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had my ring with him, and
I took off my ring and I said,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Don, I can't wear this.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:90%
I have to try this vocation.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't be able to live
with me if I didn't try this.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
you know, this

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
is the worst possible
moment in my life.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And what can you say except
what a gift to a woman entering

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
a woman's monastery
to have a man

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:90%
tell you that they want you.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been difficult at times.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But yet, through all
that, through all that,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
she has built the
strength she has today.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.562 align:middle line:84%
And she's accepted
God's calling.

00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And we should all be so lucky.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But you are
still friends today.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> We are the best of friends.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And Don said to me,
he said, you know,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
every relationship doesn't
have to end at the altar.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Not at least that way.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I meant to ask you something
earlier that comes back

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:90%
to my mind.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
When you first
came to the Abbey,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:84%
what was the reaction of people
in Hollywood to your coming

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Mr. Wallace, Hal
Wallace, who was my producer,

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a seven-year
contract with him.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And Hal told me, don't come
back because you're not

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:90%
going to go to work anyway.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.629 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he was so
angry, he just said, look,

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
if you come back to Hollywood,
you're not going to get a job,

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:84%
so you better-- you
better stay there.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about the
public's reaction?

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever come here?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.496 align:middle line:84%
Some people were angry
that you came to the Abbey.

00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they had
invested in my career.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think the public
has a right to invest.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.075 align:middle line:84%
And if you love a
person on the stage

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
or on the screen,
and that person,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
you've identified with them and
then they're no longer there,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
there is a grieving.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think I didn't die, but
it seemed to them like I died,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and it would seem
like I chose death.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So Mother Dolores, you
leave the Hollywood community.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
You come in to the
community of sisterhood.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The first couple of years
you were here as a postulant?

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Were there times
that you thought,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:90%
what on Earth am I doing?

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Am I nuts?

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Chantal, I felt like I had
been thrown head first from

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:90%
a 25-story building.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why I have a very
particular love for anyone who

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
is coming into postulancy,
because I thought

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to myself, if I die
and go to purgatory,

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
it could not be the worst
experience than those months.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What made it hard?

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
entering, perhaps,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
a world that is poor in all
of its material associations.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have everything,

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize that at the
same time you can have nothing.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I
understood at that time what

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of value poverty was.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the value of poverty?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.290 align:middle line:90%
The simplicity of it?

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I think poverty is
essentially the realization

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that everything you do and
have is in relationship.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever
miss little things?

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.554 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever--

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I'm going to
ask you this, Mother Dolores,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
but I'm driven, I'm
obsessed to ask you.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you miss little things
like lipstick, mascara?

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm an actress.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:10%
And in this costume,
lipstick wouldn't work.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe--

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It wouldn't work.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It wouldn't work.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You're right,
it wouldn't work.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd say, I would look like
an actress dressed up as a nun.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
been around a group of women

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
who were so joyful.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
There's an image out there
that nuns don't laugh.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:90%
All the nuns here laugh.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Where do you find your joy?

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Why is everybody here so happy?

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think, Chantal, it's
because there is a spectrum

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
in this particular foundation
that has never been denied,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and that is the freedom
to say what you really are

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:90%
experiencing.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's never
a depth of anguish

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
or instinctive rage or hurt
or surprise or expectation

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that the community
denies one another.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
are able to touch

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the essential root of
another's personhood,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:84%
you are in a place
of freedom where

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
joy comes because you're
so damn happy you got out

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.355 align:middle line:90%
of the last stupid mess.

00:20:36.355 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That you would just say,
oh, we did it again, thank God.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> People have bad moods.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
People have bad days.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
There's also the misconception
that when you become a nun,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
everything is smooth.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that you recognize
each other's human frailties,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.625 align:middle line:84%
and deal with them, that's
part of it, isn't it?

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's really one of
the first things that anyone

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
coming through postulancy
or novitiate has to begin

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to undertake, is the discovery
of their own real antagonism.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And an antagonism for
life, which we all

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
carry, because we all have the
trace of original sin within us

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to overcome.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And even if people
don't admit to that,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
we all know that the bad hair
day doesn't get covered up,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's there, whether you
are wearing a veil or not.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk a little bit
more about the community,

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and what it does in the
extended communities.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
How does this community
work here in Bethlehem?

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that basically
we're a land-based community,

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:84%
which is extremely important
in that we have a farm

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and a working farm in which all
the women of the community are

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And even in our brief
visit to the Abbey,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
it didn't take us long to
see just how involved this

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
community is in God's work.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:84%
The remarkable and
individual contributions

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:84%
of these women to their
faith are seen everywhere.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:84%
From Mother Margaret
Georgina, who

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
tenderly cares for each of
the Abbey's beautiful plants,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
to Sister Elizabeth, who has
the enviable and loving task

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:84%
to make sure the Abbey's
cows, appropriately

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
named Amazing and Grace,
receive the best care possible.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Even the statue of
the Virgin mother,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:84%
who greets the
guests of the Abbey,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
was meticulously
designed by another

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:90%
of the nuns, Mother Praxedes.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Presiding over all the nuns
is the founder of the Abbey,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and the one to whom
each nun may turn to

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:90%
for guidance, Lady Abbess.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Each moment of each day,
whether it be in the fields

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
or in the chapel,
there was a woman

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
who lives out her
contemplative life,

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
not only in prayer, but in
the privilege of serving

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:90%
God in a very special way.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your
expertise, Mother Dolores?

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I would say it's been acting.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I hope when I
end up, they can say,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
this is the best
act you ever did.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:90%
But I did have to join--

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I did have to join
the human race.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I did become a carpenter
for a number of years,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and learned the
trade of carpentry,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and was able to help the
community in doing repairs,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
making tables, doing chairs.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think in one of the
most extraordinary gifts

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
was learning how to
make ancient coffins,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we were able
to bury our own dead.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What a loving thing to do
to be able to build a coffin

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to put one of your own in,
to send them on their way.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of a more
loving gesture than that.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There was another way
Mother Dolores has served this

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:90%

support and the honest truth

she wanted to do
a book on the life

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that she had experienced with
Roald, and to just say it.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> She came here.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:90%
She was in a lot of pain.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.890 align:middle line:90%
She'd had a stroke.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Her husband had left her
for someone she knew.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
If I know Patricia
Neal, I would speculate

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that it was difficult
for her to say,

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go to a monastery.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I was worried about
the nunnery because, well,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:10%
one thing was that I smoked, and
they didn't want me to smoke.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And I drank, and I'm
not allowed to drink.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But you know, and I was just
frightened of what would

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:90%
happen to me in this nunnery.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And it took a lot of
strength for me to go.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And I must tell you the truth.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:90%
I must tell you the truth.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I bought a couple of
bottles when I went,

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:90%
and I hid them in the drawer.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I never had a drink from
the minute I got there.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't touch it.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how do I say
this, because I respect her

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:90%
enormously--

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
she must have been
a challenging guest.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.502 align:middle line:90%
Is that a kind way to put it?

00:29:05.502 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Um-- no, I have to say
that Patricia won't mind

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:90%
because we're very honest.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
When she came, we got
along fine for a while.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:10%
And she asked if she
could write her book here,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:10%
which was the Lady Abbess'
inspiration that she really

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:10%
think and work on this book
rather than go outside.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was the one,
of course, that

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
elected to stay with Patricia
in her writing of the book.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So we would spend many
hours discussing things.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And as Patricia
discussed, sometimes she

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
would get more and more and
more outrageous about this.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was just one
particular point where I told

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:90%
her, get the hell out of here!

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And don't you ever put your
nose across this doorstep

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.369 align:middle line:90%
again, because you are really--

00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember what
I said, but you can feel it.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.535 align:middle line:90%
It's coming up in me.

00:30:18.535 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you set a boundary.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that you've
set a boundary, Mother.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.065 align:middle line:84%
And you mirrored
to her how she was.

00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:10%
>> But the thing that you have
to know was that she walked out

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:10%
of the door, and I turned
around, and I burst into tears,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.180 align:middle line:10%
and I said, oh, my
god, what have I done?

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling her
that she is angry,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm the one who
just blew my top.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who just did it.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm telling that to her.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
this is terrible,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:90%
because I've blown it.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I really eliminated a
possibility that was enormous.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been about
two or three hours later,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.607 align:middle line:90%
and the phone rang.

00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was Patricia.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And she gets on the
phone and she says,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.566 align:middle line:90%
(DEEP VOICE) Mother Dolores?

00:31:17.566 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes?

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.936 align:middle line:84%
And said, I'm not
right, Patricia.

00:31:27.936 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not left.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not up.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not down.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother Dolores, she
really has had enough.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And she said, out!

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Out!

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Out, you go!

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't come back!

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is a little
surprising to hear.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was
being thrown to the world,

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all by myself,
and I could not swim.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:90%
So I was a little disturbed.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I love the Abbey.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantastic place.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if you can
define faith for me.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And I ask because I
think a lot of people

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
today have holes in
their souls, and they

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:90%
are looking for something.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's faith.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.410 align:middle line:90%
So how do you define faith?

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I think faith
is, first of all,

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:84%
remembering the exquisite and
extraordinary gift that God has

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
given you in very
particular moments,

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
very particular gifts
of relationship,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:90%
very particular times.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's remembering the
God that I do know.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think faith is also
having the guts to say yes

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
when you have absolutely
no idea what that Yes

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:90%
can mean or do or take you.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But it is believing
when you don't know.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I know Lady Abbess
has often told me

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that one of the reasons
she's the abbess

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is because she's the only
one around here who knows she

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know what she's doing.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.995 align:middle line:84%
She says, everybody else thinks
they know what they're doing.

00:33:48.995 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, when you
finally come to the point

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.442 align:middle line:84%
where you know
you're in a mystery,

00:33:54.442 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying
Yes to a mystery.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> People talk a lot today
about being spiritual as opposed

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:90%
to religious.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Just yesterday someone said to
me, well, I'm not religious,

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:90%
but I'm pretty spiritual.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
the difference?

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what that means?

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.719 align:middle line:84%
>> I think those two
things are a complement,

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and they have to come into a
convergence if there is going

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:84%
to be a real truth in being
either spiritual or religious.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, so do I. I'm
glad you feel that way.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you continue
your mission,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:84%
the cloistered mission, with so
few women coming to this life?

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that less and
less women come to this life.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that so?

00:34:52.500 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's a
quality rather than a quantity

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:84%
question, in that we couldn't
possibly know that we were

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
doing better
because we had more.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We can say we're doing our
best because those who are here

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:90%
are giving all they can.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's all--

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%
all you can do in a mission
is to do the next right thing.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Your faith, to me, is such
a deeply rooted, profound,

moving faith.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Saint John of the Cross wrote so
often about faith being tested,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and he called it the
dark night of the soul.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I know you've had dark
nights of the soul.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:84%
What do you do to
hold onto the faith?

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, Chantal, that I have
been in a very gifted position

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:84%

written to me over the years.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And also I was diagnosed
with a disease called

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
"sensory peripheral
neuropathy," which

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
has to do with a certain
nerve disorder in your feet

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:90%
and hands.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.390 align:middle line:84%

on a nail bed, you know,

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because it affects
your feet first,

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and then it becomes very hot.

is there for neuropathy?

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the problem
is they don't have one.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:10%
The kind of neuropathy,
which I have,

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:20.040 align:middle line:10%
which is called idiopathic,
which means you don't know.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And so since they don't
know the source of it,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:10%
they can't really treat it.

you know, I don't
know why now me,

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.860 align:middle line:84%
but I come more into the
question, since I realized how

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.470 align:middle line:90%
many people have this, why us?

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Why does God allow suffering?

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But then, why did
He allow us His son

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
to go through the most
ignominious death?

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a question that
tortures your understanding

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.050 align:middle line:90%
as a human being.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere you have to
believe that pain and suffering

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.060 align:middle line:90%
are a path.

you know, why, if you can heal
me, why don't you heal this?

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.711 align:middle line:84%

came to me, I

my being part of this community
of neuropathy sufferers

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.830 align:middle line:84%
