balance into a testament

Marion, before we
begin our conversation,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that this
is not work for me today.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I have read you and
followed you for so long.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:90%
This is following my bliss.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have to have a lot
of discussion with yourself?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.677 align:middle line:10%
Because you're so emotionally
available in "Bone"

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:10%
to put it out there.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Did you have a--

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a long, long, long--

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.187 align:middle line:90%
I'm still discussing it.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are men and women
watching this interview right

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.935 align:middle line:90%
now who have cancer.

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:90%
They will ask you.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So were you cured?

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Did you heal?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And how did you do it?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:90%
How did you get to this point?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I think healing and curing
are very different things.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I think curing is the
scientific way of keeping you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:90%
alive.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:90%
You may go on living.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But if your soul hasn't
been part of the process,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
you are not healed.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to
short circuit the soul,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
something will
happen again that you

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
will have to deal with
soul, or at least the soul

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
will attempt once
again to come to you.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:90%
But heal means wholeness.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Healing is wholeness.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And to be whole, we have to
consider our soul and our body.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So the healing process is
when you bring in the soul

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, what do you want?

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And you listen to what it wants.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we do that?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
How do we listen to
our soul's request?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:90%
What's a step one would take?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
try to get your dreams.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been cut off from
your dreams for a long time,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the unconscious doesn't
trust your consciousness.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you have been putting
it aside, maybe for years.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And every time the
soul tries to come up,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:90%
it just gets whacked down.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can try
to get even a half

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
a line of a dream, one image,
and kiss it as it flies.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So you say in your books
our dreams are the rudder

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of our unconsciousness.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean our
dreams can actually

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:90%
tell us about our bodies?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The dream comes
from the body.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the muscles
and the viscera of the body.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's an impulse--
an energy impulse

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that comes forward and
tries to find the image that

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
can communicate to
the mind, and so

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that the image is coming
right from your body.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is the connector
between soul and body.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Psychoneuroimmunology is a
science that deals with that.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And the neurotransmitters
they now know

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
can take an image from the body
and change it into chemistry.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:90%
So that if you watch--

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and they have proven this over
and over again with people

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
watching movies or
watching the news.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
If you watch horrific
images, it is going

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to affect your immune system.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get up the
next morning feeling logged

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:84%
down by darkness, because you've
got that in your chemistry now.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what if we don't
remember our dreams?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So many people say, I'd like to,
but I don't remember my dreams.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think you have
to build up a trust with

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:90%
the unconscious.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Do we all have them?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Do I have dreams?

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:84%
They say that the
reason people get

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
sick from not sleeping
is not so much the not

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:90%
sleeping as the not dreaming.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the dream,
like the body at night,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:90%
tries to balance the health.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Your body-- if it's
tired and sick at night,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
the sleep will balance
the body, right?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Or try to.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Similarity, the psyche
will try to find a balance.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So that process is going on, and
it is a sacred process, really.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how it works.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You started to give me some
insight as to how we can make

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
an effort consciously
to remember our dreams.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of
all, I would say,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I really would like
to have a dream.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I would like to get a dream.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I honor my unconscious.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I would like to.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could
spend 5 minutes or 10,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
looking at a candle and
just letting yourself

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
surrender to that other world.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you,
don't go to sleep.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, do something where
you are quiet in yourself

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:90%
before sleep.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you drop
into that world.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You may only get the
nose of the little deer

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
if you imagine the
unconscious as a deer.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
nose coming over.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe the soul
has taken so many hits.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It just sometimes won't
come out for more,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
till it puts its nose out.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.489 align:middle line:84%
And then the next night, you
write that down, by the way,

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
in your journal.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreamed I was walking
in a flower garden.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And the flower garden was where?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what's important.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Whose flower garden
were you walking in?

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
How old were you when you
knew that flower garden?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
flowers in that garden?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Do they have any particular
interest for you?

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
How old was I in the dream?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
All that's very
important, right?

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So you spend some
time working on that.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Then the next night, now you're
starting to get interested

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:90%
in this serial, right?

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So you then maybe get three
lines or maybe two lines.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, you
build up a confidence,

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:84%
so you set up a dialogue
with the unconscious.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
This happened to
me in daily life.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But here is the snapshot
version from the unconscious.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just as if the
unconscious has a camera,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
snaps it from the
unconscious point of view,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and gives it to
you in the dream.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.606 align:middle line:84%
The dream reveals what
is going on in the body.

00:09:54.606 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you, it
also reveals what's

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
going on in the body-soul-spirit
connection as well.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But I am interested
in the shadow

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%
that is lost in the body.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Define shadow.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Give me a visual image.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Shadow is the part
of ourselves that we

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:90%
haven't lived.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
It's in the unconscious.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So the symptom gives you
the unconscious image.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me see if I understand.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little girl,
I would sit in school,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:90%
and I would move.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher would
say, Chantal, don't move.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:90%
So I'd sit like this.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the shadow?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on what you locked
into your body when she said

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't dance.

00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Could that be it?

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe if your
soul wants to dance.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's the part
that's not lived.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.850 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's what part of my--

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest things
in my work is about.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.910 align:middle line:84%
You've got this-- if
you're living in your head

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a perfect madonna
as your image of femininity,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
what have you done with
the Mary Magdalene who's

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.859 align:middle line:90%
the outcast from society?

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You've stepped on her.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
You've put her down.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You stepped her.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You put her down.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.747 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
even know she's there.

00:11:28.747 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And your husband
probably doesn't even

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:90%
know that she's there.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the work
that I try to do--

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
try to bring the madonna off the
pedestal and the Magdalene up

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and find that unity, which
is the real feminine.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of your work
is about fairy tales.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
My producer, Sheila, has
a nine-year-old daughter.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And one day her daughter, Leah,
asked such a great question.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.461 align:middle line:84%
She said, mom, why are all the
mothers dead in fairy tales?

00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a good
question all right.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a good question.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:90%
So what would you say to Leah?

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the fairy tale
is a picture of a culture.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine in
those days was dead,

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
as anybody writing
a fairy tale today

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
would have a dead
mother or a stepmother,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
which is simply a word
for a negative mother.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And by negative mother,
I mean that we've

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
that voice that says,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are?

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
bringing you into life

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and bringing out and mirroring
you the very best that

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:90%
is in you, she has an agenda.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't follow that
agenda, you're just no good.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it the same
as an absent mother?

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Not exactly, because an
absent mother you could love.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
If only mommy were here,
everything would be perfect.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So she couldn't be
the cherishing mother.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
The positive mother
is the mother

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
who can put a child in
touch with its own body.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And it loves to just live.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And life is a birthright.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Sexuality is a birthright.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And because of the history of
the feminine for 2,000 years,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
how many mothers can
give that to their child?

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Not many.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Not many.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Not many.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And although the mother loves
the child with all her heart,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
she cannot give what
she hasn't got to give.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So the child grows up
with a dead mother.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've had a
negative mother in life,

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
are you saying that means you're
going to be a negative mother?

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What isn't brought to
consciousness comes to us

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:90%
as fate.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So unless you do the work.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless you do work,
it doesn't change.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And you see, because the
power of principle operates,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:90%
you don't want it to.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But you hear yourself
saying things

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that you heard as a child.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're horrified
that you're saying them.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
You say, I swore I would never
use that language to a child.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And here I am doing it, because
it's in the unconscious.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't back
to consciousness,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
you won't live it.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So let me be
sure I understand.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what you mean in "Bone"
where you talk about the idea

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies are, in essence,
an instrument through which we

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
are forced to come
to consciousness.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That is right.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's how I see it.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So then your cancer was
your body forcing you to come

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:90%
to a consciousness.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A new consciousness-- a
new level of consciousness.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And the body is saying, I
want to live my creativity.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know what the
potential is here.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.556 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go with
my destiny and live it.

Marion came perilously
close to death.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
For 20 years, she had
been waging her own battle

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
with anorexia, a
struggle she almost lost,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
but one that eventually
led her to Jungian studies

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
in Zurich and dramatic
insights into addiction, which

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:90%
ultimately saved her life.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%

"Addiction to Perfection"

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Woodman deals with this
life-changing experience.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I had this horrific
experience of going out

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:10%
of my body, and ending
up on the ceiling,

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:10%
and seeing my body on the
floor and thinking, poor, dumb,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:10%
stupid thing.

Don't you know you're dead?

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm free.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
You're dead.

there talking to your body?

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:90%

And if I wouldn't treat my dog
the way I'm treating that body.

And that was the
turning point for me.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But up until that point, I
had wanted out of my body

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
and into spirit.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And for me to be in spirit was
to be free of all this crap

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
from here down, and to try to
deal with the loss of control

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and to deal with
the greed, and the jealousy,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and the anger, and the
sexuality, and a body

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%

about anorexia with "Addiction

to Perfection," one of the
themes in there I suddenly

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
understand, where you say
addictions destroy the instinct

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:90%
for survival.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you move
into a perfectionist

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
mode where you are trying
to escape from life.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And the perfection
is a love of death,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
because life is not perfect.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:90%
No human being is perfect.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:90%
No body is perfect.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But once you get in
that addicted mode,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
you want the perfection
of whatever it

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.102 align:middle line:90%
is you happen to be hooked on.

00:18:01.102 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:90%

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what that means.

That any addict
knows that there's

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
a point where if you are
projecting onto food, mother,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
the great mother
that you never had,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
the loving, cherishing,
nurturing mother--

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
when you want mother, you
are going to have her.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Your ego is not functioning.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
little voice-- says,

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to the
refrigerator now.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I'm going
to go back to sleep.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.280 align:middle line:90%
I am going to the refrigerator.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We've always gone
to the refrigerator.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.054 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter with you?

00:18:51.054 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Up.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the voice
starts to drive you.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And you may taste
the first muffin.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it's
just wolfing food

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:90%
if you're a binger.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
And same with any addiction.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:90%
It eventually possesses you.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:90%
You are no longer present.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So the archetype is that immense
divinity, dark and light,

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
because it's satanic
as well as Godlike.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And it can just come up and
wipe out the ego completely.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So I could hear
Mozart when I was

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
hungry to the point of starving.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I never heard Mozart
before or after.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Or I could experience
the vitality of red

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that you would never
under normal circumstances

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
experience it and dance all
night when you're not eating.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And you've got another
whole level of euphoria,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
so that it was that euphoric
escape from life that I loved,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
until I was faced with
actually being out.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And then I made a choice.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think most addicts at
some point are on their knees

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
at the wall.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.535 align:middle line:84%
And they choose
to live or to die.

00:20:31.535 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand
now what spirit is.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But I would love an
example of something

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
that we could visualize today.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
What would be an example of
spirit moving in the body?

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you can
imagine Nureyev,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:10%
the great dancer of
the 20th century,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:10%
standing with his
perfectly prepared body,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:10%
that he's worked on every muscle
to bring to a perfect form.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing,
waiting for the music.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And the cord strikes and
something comes into him,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and he just lifts
off the ground.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
He just opens-- totally
surrenders to spirit.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit is what
lifts soul and body.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And what you see going on the
stage is the intermarriage.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a communion of body,
soul, and spirit right there

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, I got it.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, I got it.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the same,
Chantal, in writing.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I write every day in my journal.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But there are moments
when I suddenly

00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
realize something else
is moving the pen.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when spirit comes
in and takes over the pen,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and I surrender.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the feminine principle
surrendering to spirit, which

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:90%
is the masculine principle.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And see, that's where I think
that the addict so often is

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual person,
who is hooked in going

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
toward the material God,
rather than a spiritual God.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And the creativity is the
part that wants to live,

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and it gets caught on
an addictive object.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's tragic,
because it's death.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:10%
I said to my soul, be still
and wait without hope,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:10%
for hope would be hope
for the wrong thing.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And wait without
love, for love would

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:90%
be love of the wrong thing.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:90%
There is yet faith.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But the faith, and
the love, and the hope

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:90%
are all in the waiting.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And do not think, for you
are not ready for thought.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So the darkness
shall be the light.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.175 align:middle line:90%
And the stillness-- the dancing.

00:23:33.175 --> 00:23:36.352 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:36.352 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:48.280 align:middle line:10%
"Pain has an element of blank.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It cannot recollect
when it began,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or if there were a
time when it was not.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:90%
It has no future but itself.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Its infinite contain
its past, enlightenment

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to perceive new
periods of pain."

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:10%
>> You say that for you,
a journal is a mirror.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was small, I didn't
have friends my own age who

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
understood what I was interested
in, or they didn't understand

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
my feelings.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So I played with
them, but then when

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to commune with my own
inner feelings and my thoughts,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I wrote in my journal.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Because that way,
I got it outside.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And I could look at
it and say, oh, yeah.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:90%
That is what I think.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.339 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at your
journals progress over

00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
the years, of course, you
have such a great perspective

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:90%
on your life.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Today is your life more complex
in some ways or is it simpler?

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm getting older.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I have to simplify,
because I don't

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
have the physical strength
to hold everything together

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
that I once held together.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want more energy for
what is the essence of my life.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is the essence
of your life right now,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're conserving
your energy for?

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am extremely
interested in my intensives

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing with women and
trying to make a safe space

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:48.870 align:middle line:84%
where they can experiment
and experience who they are.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.315 align:middle line:84%
And the work is becoming
deeper and deeper and more

00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:52.115 align:middle line:90%
and more intense.

00:25:52.115 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing more and more
the connection between the body,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and the soul, and the spirit.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Do a lot of women
come to you in pain?

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That's all of them, I
would say, who come to me--

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
come in pain.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.515 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, they wouldn't bother.

00:26:10.515 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And their pain, I imagine,
would be about wanting

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to please so many people all
the time, that in essence,

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
they lose sight not only
of pleasing themselves,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:90%
but who they are as a person.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That is right.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.076 align:middle line:84%
And that has been going on since
they were very, very young.

00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in dreams
when they go back--

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
when the dream takes
them back to probably

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
when they were
two or three, they

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
find a little
child there, buried

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
in the cellar
underneath the cellar

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
even know exists.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And there they find
this little child

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that they buried
when they started

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:90%
pleasing everybody else.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And they say, who put
you in the cellar?

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And the little one says,
I am in this cellar

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:90%
because you put me there.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And you would have killed
me if I had come out.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:90%
You would have killed me.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So one has to then take
the responsibility,

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
you see, to bring that
child into adulthood.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You must see some
incredible changes in women.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Mind-blowing.

00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it comes through
huge pain, mind you.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen
women trying to walk

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
across the floor in that new
sense of themselves and just

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:90%
drop.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And I go to her.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And I say, well, what happened?

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they say the old
voice came in and said,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are?

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
You'll get over this.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
When you go home, you'll
realize this is just

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
another flaky thing
that you've been doing.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But don't get too sure
of who you think you are.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And that critical voice
is underneath everything

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:90%
they attempt to do.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it that presses
down, depresses, squashes,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
damages the feminine
that we have to find it?

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:90%
Is it the masculine?

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think so, Chantal.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have
any idea, really,

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:43.320 align:middle line:84%
what the new masculine is that
will partner that feminine.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The masculine as we
know it is patriarchal.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And it is a parody
of the masculine.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It is a power principle.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It depends on controlling
somebody else,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.565 align:middle line:84%
or controlling your own
body, or controlling nature.

00:29:01.565 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It can be even more potent
in a woman than in a man.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
There is no room for the
feminine in the speed

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
at which we think we're a lot.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not living.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It pushes everything
into an abstraction

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:90%
before we even experience it.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
passages in your new book

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:84%
called "Bone" was
indeed where you do talk

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
about the way we live
today is at such a pace

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are indeed blurring
our lives into an abstraction.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I not only agreed with it, I
wondered how I would slow down.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.635 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:49.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, cancer slowed me down.

00:29:49.052 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think heart attacks
slow a lot of people down.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the heart
just can't take

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:90%
any more undigested feeling.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
People don't take time
to digest their feelings,

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate what
is happening to them.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you bury your
mother on Tuesday.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You're expected to be
back at work on Thursday.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
It can't be that way with
the soul, with the heart.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
tragedy of the culture

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:84%
that the feminine is raped
in the body, in nature.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:90%
We just go on raping the earth.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that's one of the things

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that our 21st century
is going to be about.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.077 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
sacredness of matter.

00:30:49.077 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Either we're going to learn it,
or we're not going to survive.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In "Bone," one of the things
you do that I love is you write

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
in the margins.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a real
journal we're reading.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
You write pieces of
poetry and little notes.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I love one of them where
you define maturity

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
as loving without
losing identity.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the little notes,
one of the little snippets.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is
a piece of a poem

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:25.400 align:middle line:84%
from Emily Dickinson that
begins, "The Soul has Bandaged

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Moments."

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you see, Emily
Dickinson is masterful with

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:90%
metaphor.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And if it hits exactly
the right place,

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
you just shudder from
the top to bottom.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those moments
of aha, it's right.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I know it's right.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what do
the words mean--

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:90%
"The Soul has Bandaged Moments?"

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's those terrible
moments when the soul falters.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And something has hit so
deeply that it cannot take it

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:90%
in, and it's paralyzed.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:13.073 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.073 --> 00:32:16.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you read it to me?

00:32:16.272 --> 00:32:17.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:17.198 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:90%


00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
at different times, too.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:32.140 align:middle line:84%
"The soul has bandaged moments
when too appalled to stir.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
She feels some
ghastly fright come up

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and stop to look at her."

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's that combination
of the immensity

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:84%
of what is happening and
stopped to look at her,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:58.160 align:middle line:84%
where she puts the divinity
and the human together.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.745 align:middle line:90%
And it's so frightening.

00:33:01.745 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> She has a way
of capturing pain.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> She knew it so well.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> There's another one.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Wow, you have the
book in your hands.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have Marion
Woodman in front of me.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
There's another one called
"There is a pain so utter."

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I could do that
would for you from heart.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Why am I not surprised?

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> "There is a pain so utter,
it swallows substance up,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
then covers the
abyss with trance,

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
so memory can walk
around, across, upon it,

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:52.420 align:middle line:84%
as one within a swoon goes
safely where an open eye would

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:90%
drop him bone by bone."

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.844 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:02.844 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.790 align:middle line:10%
This is by my favorite
revolutionary poet, William

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Blake, "The Tyger."

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.880 align:middle line:90%
"Tyger!

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Tyger!

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:84%
burning bright in the
forest of the night.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:23.447 align:middle line:84%
What immortal hand or eye could
frame thy fearful symmetry?

00:34:23.447 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
In what distant deeps or skies
burnt the fire of thine eyes?

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
On what wings dare he aspire?

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
What the hand, dare
seize the fire?

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And what shoulder
and what art could

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:90%
twist the sinews of thy heart?

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And when thy heart
began to beat,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:84%
what dread hand and
what dread feet?

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:90%
What the hammer?

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:90%
What the chain?

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.151 align:middle line:90%
In what furnace was thy brain?

00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:90%
What the anvil?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.316 align:middle line:84%
What dead grasp dare thy
deadly terrors clasp?

00:35:07.316 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
When the stars threw
down their spears

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and watered heaven
with their tears,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:90%
did he smile his work to see?

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Did he who made
the Lamb make thee?

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Tyger!

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Tyger!

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.035 align:middle line:84%
burning bright in the
forest of the night, what

00:35:36.035 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:84%
immortal hand or eye dare
frame thy fearful symmetry?"

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go back a little bit.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we were talking about
how our body is an instrument

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that forces us to come to
some kind of consciousness.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to know specifically,
what was the consciousness

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:90%
that you came to with cancer?

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what I was
about to say to you?

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:10%
I was about to say, what
were you doing wrong

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:10%
that you got cancer?

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Was it something wrong?

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think it was wrong.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
people taking guilt

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.930 align:middle line:90%
on when they get any illness.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not guilt. I mean, that
only compounds the difficulty.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:90%
That's that voice.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.181 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the matter with you?

00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:32.066 align:middle line:90%
Why did you get cancer?

00:36:32.066 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:90%
What did you do wrong?

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.796 align:middle line:90%
And it compounds the--

00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:84%
well, the immune system
just gets sicker and sicker.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That voice will pound the
life out of the immune system.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not that.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But the question for me was,
what can I learn from this now?

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do I need to
experience this right now?

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.307 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come to,
Chantal, more and more-- and I

00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
don't think I'm anywhere
near the end of this yet.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The sheer joy of life,
and having faced death,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.327 align:middle line:84%
and going through that
over a period of two years,

00:37:21.327 --> 00:37:22.910 align:middle line:84%
am I ever going to
see another spring?

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Will I ever see
another snowdrop?

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Makes you see snowdrops.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And every day is grace--

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:90%
literally a gift of God.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And the people I meet
and the smiles on their

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
faces, the children
I meet, my husband--

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:90%
life is such a gift.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
about it is that while I

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:11.190 align:middle line:84%
have lost a lot of my physical
attributes, I have new eyes,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have new
ears, and new nose.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:19.760 align:middle line:84%
The senses are all operating
in another dimension,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:90%
which I call--

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's been called that
for centuries-- subtle body.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So that I can hear Mozart's last
concertos and my heart breaks.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I read Lear.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think, how is it
possible for a human being

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.700 align:middle line:84%
still on this side of the
veil to write such a thing?

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It is so magnificent
in its simplicity.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm interested to know
the differences in terms

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:90%
of the degree of loving--

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:90%
how that has changed.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, how
do you love Ross

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
differently, right
now in this instant,

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
as you and I sit here,
than how you loved him,

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:90%
say, 30 years ago?

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.792 align:middle line:84%
How do you love him
today differently?

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> 30 years ago, I was
projecting my own soul onto

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted him to
be like my inner man.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And when he wasn't
like that inner man,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:90%
I was disappointed in him.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it didn't matter
what he did for me.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's a very
kind, loving person.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't
matter what he did.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It was never quite good enough.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So there was no way
he could measure up.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I got married,
I was in heaven.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was stardom,
because I really

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
believed I was marrying
this inner beloved.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, it took 25
years to change that.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And my journey to
Zurich was part of that,

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
because the marriage
got rockier and rockier.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I think he also projected
the inner divine.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:84%
They project that perfection
in the first marriage

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:90%
or in the first loving.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Then I came home from Zurich.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had been through
quite a bit there.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And we had seen each other
over there five years,

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:84%
but it was a different person
that came home each time.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting in
my little living room.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was attempting
to cook an egg in one

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:90%
of those little poachers.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:90%
You put the egg in the top.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't like people
around me in the morning.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I like to write in my
journal, work on my dreams,

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and be silent, and find my
own center for this day.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
do this in the kitchen.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.207 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what went wrong,

00:41:42.207 --> 00:41:44.040 align:middle line:84%
but the egg sort of
fell out of the poacher.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I really could
have done better than this.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
What'd I come home to this for?

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:90%
I could've been somebody.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was so unhappy.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Because of the egg?

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Because of the egg.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And because he was--

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:84%
little spindly legs
and an old watch--

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:84%
black watch, house coat
he should have thrown out

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.670 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:90%
And there he was.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And then he put his
hand on a loaf of bread

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and just the sheer humanity of
cutting that bread for himself.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And that hand that had planted
tulips with me, that had made

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:38.280 align:middle line:84%
love to me, that had worked
with my dying mother--

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw how exquisite
the human being is.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought how
schizophrenic the world

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:90%
is outside this apartment.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And here we are together
in the huge investment

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:90%
that is in this relationship.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't lean on each other.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:06.240 align:middle line:90%
We walk parallel paths.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But we love each other as
we are in our humanity.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And that is noble in itself.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And my heart just broke open.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It just was like a flood
that came through me,

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and it hit him.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.597 align:middle line:84%
And he just turned
around and said, Marion,

00:43:32.597 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:90%
would you like some more coffee?

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:90%
He got it.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:84%
He felt what it
was that hit him.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what love is.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not that sentimental
stuff you read about.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.770 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
When it lands, it
just comes like glue.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that
it's sticky or that,

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.265 align:middle line:90%
but it holds atoms together.

00:44:00.265 --> 00:44:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:90%
You say, what's the difference?

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I treasure him as
I watch him now,

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
gathering his own soul
together for take-off.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's so beautiful to watch.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And we treasure every
day with each other,

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:31.170 align:middle line:84%
because we know it
won't be our many days.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I have no sense of
wanting to hold onto him.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I want to be free.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:90%
He wants to be free.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And we love each
other in that freedom.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.195 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.195 --> 00:44:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You know how Joseph
Campbell used to say "follow

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.120 align:middle line:90%
your bliss?"

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that where
you are right now?

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My definition of bliss
is that you and destiny--

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.790 align:middle line:90%
you and God are in sync.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And are you right now?

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to let
you get away with this.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what's
going on with you.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm going through
another threshold right now.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know quite
where it's taking me.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And as always, I'm nervous
about where it's taking me.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It may be into a much
more introverted life.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK if it
happens that way.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I say I'm
a little dubious--

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:48.340 align:middle line:84%
the here and now, right in the
moment-- yes, I feel in sync.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Just looking a
little farther ahead,

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm already
in the transition.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it manifest
in your body?

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
How do you know you're
in a transition?

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the old
stuff comes up.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't get away from it.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It comes up in eating patterns.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It comes up in swelling of the
body, holding on too tight,

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.465 align:middle line:90%
and stopping the energy moving.

00:46:22.465 --> 00:46:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And I can see it in my dreams.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, wherever you
go on your journey,

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I want you to always
feel how much I love you.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you, Chantal.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I do.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a wonderful time
and thank you so very much.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we are kindred souls.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a poem that comes
to you as we stand here?

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have an Emily
poem that I think of many,

00:46:55.298 --> 00:46:58.392 align:middle line:90%
many times in this garden.

00:46:58.392 --> 00:47:07.570 align:middle line:84%
"A sepal, petal, and a thorn

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:15.310 align:middle line:84%

a breeze, a caper in the trees.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.205 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a rose."

00:47:16.205 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:90%
