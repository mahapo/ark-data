was discovered by the great

Mahalia Jackson.

Della knew then
that it was possibly

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
to spiritually move people
through her creative talents.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Della went on to
perform in nightclubs

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
all over the country,
but it wasn't

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
until her performance on
the "Ed Sullivan Show"

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that really made her a star.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:10%
She has been a true pioneer
in the world of show business

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:10%

sitting down with us today.

I know God is in this room.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But since you do it
so well, will you

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
remind us all with a
blessing before we begin?

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you have
just blessed us.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:10%
You've recognized that
God is in the midst of us.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
I think makes people

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
so wary of having a relationship
with God-- there seems to be so

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:90%
many forms you have to follow.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's not really necessary.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
What's necessary is to know
that God lives inside you.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And you are in contact
with him whenever you

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:90%
are consciously aware of him.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And since he does live inside
of you, you have all that He is.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:90%
And He is a blessing power.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So you just blessed all of us.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Do you think, Della, that there
is a difference between prayer

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:10%
and talking to God?

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:90%
Every thought is a prayer.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you have
to come with flowery--

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, Great Savior,
or Rose of Sharon,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:90%
oh bright and Morning Sun.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:90%
He's inside of me.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:84%
He knows I'm going
through a crisis right now

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and I don't feel
Rose of Sharon-ish.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel I want to talk to God
who's my friend about what's

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
happening to me.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I got this from my mother.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:84%
She had a constant
conversation with God,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
which taught me that nothing
is too small or too large.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Or there's nothing that
he is not aware of.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:84%
She would say, "Now,
Father, what are

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:90%
we going to cook for dinner?

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And she'd listen.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, "Oh
yeah, that'd be nice."

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I as a child,
coming up I understood

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
a constant
relationship with God.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And I find it quite favorable.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds to me that your
mother taught you and had great

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
faith.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this is going to
sound kind of strange.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.260 align:middle line:90%
She didn't teach me.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
She didn't say, "Now, this
is this and this is that."

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:90%
She lived it every day.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a normal mean for her.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
She and God laughed and talked.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I can
really explain it to you.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But as a child,
it didn't make Him

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
somewhere away that I
had to get in touch with.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make him
something I had to do.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Because He lived in
a house with my mama.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So there was no thing I
had to be, or say, or do,

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
no form I had to fill out.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Because there He was.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
He lived in the house with us.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And so my father
worked in a steel mill.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
He poured steel,
literally poured steel.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:90%
And he made $65 a week.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was everything.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
That was all the
money for everything.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And it would not last.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It would run out.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:90%
And she would sit--

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
we had this big ugly
green chair that she

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
would sit in with
her legs crossed,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:90%
in a yoga or Indian manner.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And she would moan and rock.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And she would talk to God.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And she would say,
"I've got enough meat

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:90%
to make the lunches.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And I have some of
those black eyed peas

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:90%
left from the other day.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a
couple of tomatoes.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could make
that for dinner.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have any bread.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And I really need some bread.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.045 align:middle line:84%
And the money has run-- but
you know the money's run out.

00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's no bread.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:90%
And I need some bread.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that she was begging,
or asking, or anything.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It was very feasible
to me that he

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
was a constant presence,
ever available, always

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:90%
interested in what you needed.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Then answer me this, if
you will is faith a gift?

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All that God is, I am.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that He has given me

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
is his faith in me
to be as wonderful

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:90%
as He created me to be.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.852 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
attributes that I have.

00:07:26.852 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm made in his
image and likeness.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So if He has faith
in me, then faith

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
faculties that is mine.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Della's faith was seriously
tested when she witnessed

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
the darker side of humanity
at the death of her very close

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
friend Redd Foxx.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I was on "Royal
Family" with Redd Foxx.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Redd Foxx fell in my arms
before he made his transition.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was so disgusted with
the way his wife was treated.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
The doctor came out in
the hospital waiting room

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and said to Mrs.
Foxx, "Your husband

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:90%
has gone on, Mrs. Foxx."

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And the powers that be for the
"Royal Family" said, "Well,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to do?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.726 align:middle line:84%
Because this script is
written for Redd and Della."

00:08:15.726 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the woman is
sitting right here

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.141 align:middle line:84%
and they were talking
like, "Well, maybe we

00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
could get so-and-so and maybe
we could such and such."

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has said, "Mrs. Foxx"--

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:90%
now, I am livid.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It was so disrespectful.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I said I would not ever
do a situation comedy

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of television show.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I wouldn't want them to
treat Franklin and my daughter,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Della Junior, that way.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Della's confidence in show
business was restored when she

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
was asked to start a new
television pilot about angels.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
However, the show seemed to
have little chance of airing.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But with God on her
side, Della helped

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
make "Touched by an Angel"
a phenomenal success.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I get a call to come to CBS.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:90%
They want to talk to me.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.234 align:middle line:84%
And I go and they
tell me-- introduce me

00:09:04.234 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to Martha Williamson
and tell me they're

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
going to do "Touched
by an Angel,"

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to do
any more of this at all.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.076 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my husband,
who is my manager,

00:09:13.076 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
"Please tell them
in a nice way I

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do this,
to get somebody else."

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So he says, "Well,
think about it."

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So I come home, and I went
in my room, got in my bed,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.859 align:middle line:90%
and prayed.

00:09:23.859 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Father,
you know I don't

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
like the corporate structure.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You know I don't like
working with these people.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
They have no heart.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy singing.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm comfortable.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:90%
You're blessing me.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm fine."

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And He said as clearly to
me as I'm saying to you,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
"Do this for me and you
can retire in 10 years."

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Very distinctly, He has English.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Very distinctly and
very big, you know?

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:90%
And now, I've got to do this.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.969 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't disobey
him that boldly.

00:09:50.969 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I sneak around
and do a few things.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But just boldly say, "No,
I'm not going to do that"--

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
so I start to do it, which I
find out later, my purpose,

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
not only to do the
show, but is to be there

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:90%
because it's going to be rocky.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm
the one that knows

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be
successful for 10 years,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be there to say
things, and do things, and hold

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:90%
people together.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was funny,
because the first year

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I said-- when it was over,
they gave us four shows,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:90%
they gave us six shows.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
It took to get to 13--

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
so the 13th show,
they said, "That's it.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.307 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:10:27.307 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And we're not going to be back."

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:10%
So I called everybody
together said,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:10%
"Take whatever you need kind
of job in order to survive,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:10%
because we're coming
back next year.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
the hit of the season.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So don't get hung
up in nothing so you

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
can't give back, because you
want to be a part of this."

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So the second year,
they all came back

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.367 align:middle line:84%
and we were the hit
of the season, OK?

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first season when I
was telling them to hold on

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and I was telling them God
said this, they're going,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:90%
"Uh huh, yeah, I know."

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the second season,

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
they're saying,
"What did God say

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.614 align:middle line:90%
we're going to do next season?"

00:10:59.614 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I loved it!

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
They came one at a time,
took me over to the corner.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Whispering, "Ssh, ssh."

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> "What did he say we're
going to do next season?"

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is our sixth season.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I only have four more to do.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Not too long ago, I was
watching an episode of "Touched

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:84%
by an Angel," and I
was sobbing, Della.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the episode with the
little boy named Petey.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And Winona Judd sings
the 151st Psalm.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I was sobbing when all the
neighbors come and sing

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:90%
to Petey.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And a friend of mine called.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Do you ever
watch 'Touched by an Angel'?"

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Chantal,
I watch it all the time,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:90%
but don't tell anybody.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm so embarrassed I don't
want people to know."

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got a story like that.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a man who
works at the airport.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:90%
He's a skycap.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And he is a man's man.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, he's a man's man.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's been working
there maybe 30 years

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and I've been traveling
there 30 years.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And so we are travel friends.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, "Step
over here a minute."

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, "OK."

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.655 align:middle line:84%
He says, "You know, you've got
the best show on television.

00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
If they would listen to you,
you could help their lives."

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
He said, "It made
me cry one day."

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.536 align:middle line:84%
He said, "But don't you
dare tell anybody that."

00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I'll
never speak a word.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.385 align:middle line:90%
I won't tell a soul."

lean on the sink a little bit

to you're a good friend.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So we became friends
on the telephone.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, I don't know when,
but one night, he calls me up.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And for the time,
it was 11 o'clock

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles, which
made it 1:00 in Chicago.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And he called me.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting at my desk.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And I look at the clock.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's talked to
me for 45 minutes.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And he hasn't said
anything about no business.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So at this 45 minute
conversation on the phone,

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.945 align:middle line:90%
I knew--

00:16:09.945 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> He had showed you.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:10%
>> That this was--

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:10%
Franklin was the one.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Because it wasn't
rushing to fall in love.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't, "Ooh, you
look good to me."

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It had grown from
business to a friendship.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:90%
He had a good mind to talk to.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:90%
He was a lot of fun.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I knew all this before the
45 minute call, you see?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that he was the one.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Repeat after me.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:10%
I am

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I am.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> An unconditional lover.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> An unconditional lover.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That means I can
love through anything.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> With the love of the Lord.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>> With the love of the Lord.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I surround you.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I surround you.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now.

00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>> With the powerful.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.771 align:middle line:90%
>> With the powerful.

00:16:55.771 --> 00:16:56.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Unconditional love.

00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:57.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Unconditional love.

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Of God.

00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Of God.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.247 align:middle line:84%
>> You ready for
a dicey question?

00:17:02.247 --> 00:17:03.579 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know what that means.

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you can stand the answer,
I can stand the question.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there anybody who
ever says to you, "Della,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:10%
that is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard."

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I think most of the time.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Because God does not
make common sense.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
common about God.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you listen
to God, He tells

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
you to do things that he doesn't
necessarily tell other people

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to do.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with them.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:90%
He speaks to me.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And from where you're
sitting, I imagine

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing does
look stupid, because you

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:90%
don't have any information.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
to have the faith

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to know that you
know what you know.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
For an example, as
I told you earlier,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew that Franklin
was what God had sent

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to me, because God told me so.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
But God didn't
tell Franklin, OK?

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
So for four years--

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm so serious.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So for four years,
it was my faith,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this
was my stuff, that I

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
took some things that--
and it made me grow.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when I met
Franklin, I was--

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I was powerful and successful.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And my attitude was,
"If you can't give me

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
what I want when
I want it, you can

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.621 align:middle line:90%
keep it 'cause I don't need it.

00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll get it myself."

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And those four years, I
don't mean they reduced me.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't misunderstand me.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
He didn't break me down.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trying to say that.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But I learned how to work
with him, to be one with him,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
to let some of my stuff go.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And he learned how to let
some of this stuff go.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And we became one, you see?

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But I don't mind, you
know, what you think of.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything you think
is your problem.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not my problem.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So let me ask you this.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think people
ever think, "Della Reese,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:90%
she can be tough."

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll say it again.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:90%
What you think is your problem.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not my problem.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if I need to be
tough, I can be tough.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if I need to
be sweet, I'm sugar.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if you make me mad,
you will know I'm angry.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if you appeal to
me, I want to help you.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to be--
yes, I'm a human--

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
part of me anyway
is a human being.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I have all
of those things

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:90%
that you're asking me about.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to learn
how to do that.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn how to take
someone's opinion of me

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and say, "That's
your responsibility."

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You just did it.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I did?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You just did it.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Did I do it?

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just that simple.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You just did it.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Didn't she just do it?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you hear her just do it?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:90%
She just did it.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I did it, didn't I?

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's your responsibility.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:10%
What you think-- listen,
I'm having enough trouble

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:10%
working with what I'm thinking.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:10%
I don't have time to be
working with what I'm thinking

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:10%
and what you're thinking, too.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
be judging me anyway.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The Bible says, "Judge not
so you won't be judged."

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So you think this--
see, that's what causes

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.420 align:middle line:90%
the wars and the confusion.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
You think what I
just did was stupid.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have to
retaliate and think

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing is stupid.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so now here we are
in the stupid thing

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:90%
going back and forth.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.696 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of us
are progressing.

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We're wasting time
here, because you're

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.140 align:middle line:84%
going to do and be
and have who you are.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
What you draw to you is
what you're going to have.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And if I let you draw
me into stupidity,

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm going to have.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I have to have sense
enough to say, "Well, no, I

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
don't need to go there.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%
You have that."

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you always know this?

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.515 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:20:36.515 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But see, I didn't
always know that I

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
had the right to know this.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.490 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I always knew this and I always
responded to my knowledge.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But it used to bother
me if you thought

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't absolutely correct.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It used to bother me if you--

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:84%
ah, I couldn't care less if I
sat down like this and said,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:90%
"I'm going to care.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to care.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to sit
here 'til I care."

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:90%
I would probably have a beard.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons that
I have personally loved you

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:84%
for as long as I've known you
and the reason so many do is

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
that you, Della, have a--

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
it's a presence of joy.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a room and
you can feel your joy,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:84%
though you have been through
trials and tribulations.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Other people have been through
trials and tribulations

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and they have not walked into
the light and they are angry.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
You walked into the light.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no, I was in the light.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Always?

00:21:36.285 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You see, I'm telling you--

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I just told you about my momma.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me again so I know.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> For as long as
I could remember,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I have been consciously
aware of God,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Christ inside of me.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So I've always
been in the light.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And once, once he brings you
through something-- oh Father,

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:90%
please let me get this over--

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
once you know that you're
in the direst of places

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and you speak to Him and
He brings you through,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:90%
you can never be captured again.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you know that
all you have to do

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is go to Him and speak
to him and that he

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is, through your faith, going
to bring you out of this.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing but joy in that.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's when you are
confused, and you

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
you're going to do,

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know how it's
going to come out that you feel

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:90%
you are part of the darkness.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what negativity
does to you.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It confuses you so that it
makes you separate yourself

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
from your power, which is
the God that's inside of you.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
That's his whole point.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.677 align:middle line:90%
I won't let Him do that to me.

00:22:45.677 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> God has answered your prayer.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:49.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:22:49.922 --> 00:22:53.778 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:53.778 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:10%
When you love your enemies,
you strip them of power.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:10%
When you hate them, you
give them your power.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Because what you have your
mind on has its mind on you.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
In order to hate
somebody, you've

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.501 align:middle line:84%
got to think about
them all the time.

00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Della persevered in the face
of racial discrimination by her

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
will, her determination, but
most importantly her faith.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:10%
>> What brought
me from the slums,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:10%
which was before the ghetto,
to where I am now was the fact

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:10%
that I sincerely believed that
God wanted for me the very

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:10%
best, that he had
given me this talent.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And all I had to do was go
and He would go with me.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And if I would open my
mouth, He would speak for me,

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that He would never
leave me nor forsake me.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
My mother showed
me that every day.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:90%
I took that with me.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I got knocked down, I
bounced up and I started again.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.446 align:middle line:90%
Bless people who curse you.

00:24:03.446 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Jesus hanging on the
cross blessed them folks

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.694 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Forgive
them, Lord, they

00:24:06.694 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
don't know what they're doing."

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.677 align:middle line:90%
That's your statement.

00:24:11.677 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I forgive you, because you
don't know what you're doing.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who mess
with a child of God.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know I'm
holding my zapping power back.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:26.478 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to forgive
you and let you slide.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm a creative individual.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I must be about
creating something.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know about
living on the edge.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Every day is exciting.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I woke up this
morning by myself.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I got up out of bed by myself.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I washed my face and
brushed my teeth by my--

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I walked down them
steps by myself.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:90%
I got dressed by myself.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:90%
There was no nurse.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:90%
There was no doctor.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:90%
There were no x-rays.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:90%
There were no shots.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:90%
There were no pills.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.509 align:middle line:90%
I got up by the grace of God.

00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And that day is exciting.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's already exciting.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "I can get back
into bed, because I've

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:90%
had a good day already."

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:90%
That's just my nature.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Which leads me to something
else I was thinking about.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:10%
When I think of your
schedule, I couldn't do it.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.156 align:middle line:10%
I know men who couldn't
do your schedule.

00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes, ma'am.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Because a man couldn't
do it and I could do it?

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.841 align:middle line:90%
Why could that be a compliment?

00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:90%
That's another whole show.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's go on.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Well no, let's stay here.

00:25:34.086 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's stay here.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:90%
The physicality of it.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's not.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:90%
I have a piece of God in me.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The piece of God in
me is the same size

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as the piece of God in
every man in this room.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has any more god
in them than I have in me.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And if I-- if I call on the God
in me, all that God is I am.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:90%
All that He has is mine.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
If I call on that,
I can do anything,

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:90%
be I male, female, whatever.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there ever mornings,
particularly Sunday mornings

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.324 align:middle line:84%
when you preach, that you
open your eyes and you say,

00:26:10.324 --> 00:26:12.339 align:middle line:90%
"I don't want to do this?"

00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, there are mornings when
I say that but not necessarily

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Sunday mornings.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Because Sunday morning is
when I get revitalized.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That may be the only morning
that I want to get up.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But this morning, I didn't want
to get up and come here and be

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to lay there
and just get way down there

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and turn that electric blanket
on, just get way down in there.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But not on a Sunday morning,
because on Sunday morning, I

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
get to be with
people of like mind.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And we get to experience
the spirit of God.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So Sunday, for me, is
the best day of the week.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
mornings I don't

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:90%
want to be picked up at 5:30.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be picked up at
6:30 a lot of those mornings.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> What gets you out of bed?

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I took the job to do
"Touched by an Angel."

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:90%
I signed a contract.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:90%
I had the opportunity to say no.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I signed the
contract, I took on--

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to "Pick
me up at 5:30."

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to "Pick
me up at 6:30."

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to "I will stay here
and work until you get it."

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Now see, that because--

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
if I had said no, I could've
laid in bed all day every day.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But I said yes and
I signed my name.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So that-- you know, you grumble
a little bit, but you get up

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and you do what you have to do.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.359 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's fascinating
that you say Sunday is the one

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:32.360 align:middle line:90%
day that you do get up.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.899 align:middle line:84%
Because I would
think, boy, that's

00:27:33.899 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the day that you're
most tired and you feel

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:90%
most entitled to stay in bed.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no, no, no.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that when you are
given the gift of being able

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
to, say, sing like you do, one
of the things you have to do is

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that God gave it to
you and own the gift and say,

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:90%
"I can do it."

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And that makes you better at it.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same thing
when you are a minister

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and you preach the way you do?

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Because I have seen you preach.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Is that something you have to
own and say, "That's a gift

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and I'm good at it?"

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The criteria for
me as a minister

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
is of myself, of myself,
I can do nothing.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Because as an
entertainer, it is myself.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I depend on myself to do it.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I depend on my voice.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I depend on my stage knowledge.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:90%
I depend on the arrangement.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I depend on the musicians.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I come from the God in me, but
I am in charge of these things,

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
because this is the talent
He gave me to work with.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:84%
As a minister, I claim the
right to teach the lesson

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:90%
as Jesus would have taught it.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus's criterion is "Of
myself, I can do nothing.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Get me out of the way.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Come up through me
and say the things

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
that these people need to hear."

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.679 align:middle line:84%
The people who come to the
church, I don't know them.

00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't been in
touch with them every--

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they need.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Only God knows what they need.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.566 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the times
when people say-- especially

00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the people in the
church who have

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to do the service with me say,
"This is the dumbest thing."

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.099 align:middle line:84%
Because I have the lesson
and I'm on the way to church.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And He'll say, "Don't say that.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Say this."

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And all the songs are
arranged for that.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:84%
All the people are
ready for that.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.829 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not going to do that.

00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:34.703 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:29:34.703 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Because this is what--

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and this comes up
and comes through.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.881 align:middle line:84%
And people will come
and say, "That's

00:29:38.881 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
exactly what I needed
to hear today."

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it feel
like when you preach?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I see you
physically change.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.109 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
happens physically.

00:29:50.109 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
something burning in you.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.895 align:middle line:90%
Is that my imagination?

00:29:52.895 --> 00:29:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's not
your imagination,

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:90%
because I am out of the way.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying to you.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the spirit of God that
is doing what is being done.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, He knows
what he needs to hear.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:90%
He knows what she needs to hear.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it comes up
out of me, those things.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's her problem.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
bothering you.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I go, my prayer is "Let
them see You when they see me.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Let them hear You
when they hear me.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Less of me, more of Thee."

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
So I'm out of the way.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening
is the Father

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is coming up through me, to
me, to say the things that you

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.983 align:middle line:90%
need to hear.

00:30:35.983 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Put your hand on your heart,
and put your hand on your head,

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and say to you, to
you, "I love you."

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.821 align:middle line:90%
>> "With the love of the Lord."

00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>> With the love of the Lord.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> "I surround you."

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.885 align:middle line:90%
>> I surround you.

00:31:00.885 --> 00:31:01.685 align:middle line:90%
>> "Right here."

00:31:01.685 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> "Right now."

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right now.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.338 align:middle line:90%
>> "With the powerful."

00:31:05.338 --> 00:31:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> With the powerful.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> "Unconditional love."

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Unconditional love.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> "Of God."

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Of God.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> "And so it is."

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And so it is.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

00:31:14.648 --> 00:31:18.914 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:18.914 --> 00:31:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It was in her early days
working with Mahalia Jackson

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that Della first experienced
how powerful God could be.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.674 align:middle line:84%
How did the great Mahalia
Jackson inform your life?

00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she taught me some
things that I did not know she

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
taught me until much
later in my life.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really care for her.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I went with her when I was 13.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And my mother looked her
in the eye and said to her,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.010 align:middle line:84%
"I would let my child
go with anybody,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:90%
because I have a good girl.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:90%
But I'm trusting you.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And I expect you to
bring my good girl back."

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mahalia took
this to heart.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.359 align:middle line:84%
And she was worse than my
mother, who was very definite.

00:32:02.359 --> 00:32:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she
was strict, but she

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.850 align:middle line:84%
was definite about what
you were going to do

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and what you
weren't going to do.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And Mahalia was
worse than my mother.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't care for her at all.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But what happened-- the
thing that she taught me--

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I had this note.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I could hit this high note.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I found out I
don't know when--

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:90%
don't ask me for a date--

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that when you hit a high
note, people's flesh crawls.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's right on
the pitch or whatever,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:84%
a high note will make your flesh
crawl and your inner ear ring.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't know
these were the things,

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that it did
something to people.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So when everything wasn't
going like I wanted to go,

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I'd go "Ah!"

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.066 align:middle line:90%
And it would work.

00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:90%
I found out that it worked.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to
sing with Mahalia,

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I went to help this old lady.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So this was my attitude.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:90%
So I would sing.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.216 align:middle line:84%
I would sing all up
and down the aisles.

00:32:55.216 --> 00:32:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I'd climb over the pews.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd jump off the stage.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I was young and vigorous.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And Mahalia would say,
"Sing baby, oh, sing baby,"

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:90%
and just encourage me.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Then when I would sit
down, she would not

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.860 align:middle line:90%
get up out of the seat.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:19.097 align:middle line:84%
And she would start to moan,
"Ooh, ooh, hmm, mmm, hmm."

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
People are jumping
out of the balcony.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't said a word.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:90%
She ain't done nun'.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.734 align:middle line:84%
I done run all up
and down the aisles,

00:33:25.734 --> 00:33:27.608 align:middle line:84%
and jumped all over the
seats and everything.

00:33:27.608 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
sitting there humming.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- I
couldn't stand that.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.590 align:middle line:10%
How does she do that to me?

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.210 align:middle line:10%
I was very upset by it.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:10%
But then I began to
watch her, you know?

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would notice that
she played all day.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But about two hours before
the time to do the concert,

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:49.490 align:middle line:84%
she went away,
absolutely went away.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:84%
She either went to her
room and picked up a Bible

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:55.250 align:middle line:90%
or she just went away from us.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.459 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean by that?

00:33:56.459 --> 00:33:57.258 align:middle line:90%
From the prayers--

00:33:57.258 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> She just went away, OK?

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.320 align:middle line:84%
When we got to the
place, we had prayer.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
We always made a
circle and had prayer.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And we said the
prayer and went back

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.717 align:middle line:84%
to our makeup and
work on my hair,

00:34:08.717 --> 00:34:09.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever we were doing.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.989 align:middle line:84%
She said the prayer and
she stayed in the prayer.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So when she went out
there, she was so full

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.804 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit of God.

00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
If she had a cough,
they would've

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.359 align:middle line:90%
jumped out of the balcony.

00:34:18.359 --> 00:34:19.159 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.830 align:middle line:84%
She taught me that the
art of communication

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.930 align:middle line:90%
is from within out.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:25.730 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:29.719 align:middle line:84%
And it's that-- if I get the
first copy, if my copy is not

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
clear, yours is
going to be blurred.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And she taught me that, not
with all these explanations

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you instinctively.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:90%
I saw what she was doing.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I saw that she was coming
from-- all the rest of us

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:90%
was coming from our voices.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And she was coming from
the Christ inside of her.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.070 align:middle line:84%
She taught me the
art of communicating.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:52.840 align:middle line:90%
Love is not tough love.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:90%
Love is not stuck on yourself.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why, when people start
telling you, "If you love me

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:90%
you would"--

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:90%
huh?

>> Della's church called
Understanding Principles

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
for Better Living has become
increasingly popular over

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the years because of the
practical way she teaches

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:90%
God's word.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Is it a faith?

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it like
Episcopal, it's Catholic?

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:10%
>> When we get to
wherever spirits go,

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:10%
there will be a lot of
disappointed peoples,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:10%
because there will
be no sign that says,

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:10%
"The Baptists go here and
the Episcopalians go here."

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:10%
We all look the same to God.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:10%
God has no respect of person.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.450 align:middle line:90%
We are all the same to Him.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So we will all be in one group.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And I can't hardly wait.

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to see Him trying to
find where the Catholics go

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and where the--

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.930 align:middle line:84%
"does anyone see where
the Baptists are?

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for the
Protestants around here?"

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I want to be there.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to laugh out loud.

00:36:00.495 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
They're probably going to put me
out of heaven because y'all do

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:90%
so much funny stuff.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.473 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to laugh at all of it.

00:36:05.473 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, in the year 2000,
a lot of people are changing

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:10%
their image, their view,
their discussion of what God

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:10%
physically looks like.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they had
a picture painted.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
that's going to work.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
They had a picture
painted of Christ.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And he turned out to be black.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't how people
can live with that.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But I always wondered
how He stood out there

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:84%
in that desert, lived in that
desert, and stayed so pale

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and his eyes so blue when
everybody else in that desert

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.620 align:middle line:90%
was brown.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I wondered--
well, you know what I mean.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I go in the sun,
I get darker, so I just--

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:90%
but He was the Son of God.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So maybe he didn't want to be
dark and he just stayed light.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm a blue
eyed light person.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.715 align:middle line:90%
And I can see him this way.

00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But you don't
live in the desert.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:90%
You weren't born in the desert.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born of people
who lived in the desert.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So the pigmentation
of your skin would not

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
be that, that of the
pigmentation of people

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.414 align:middle line:84%
who had lived for centuries
in the sun, in the desert.

00:37:06.414 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I saw
the picture I thought,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:90%
"That makes sense to me."

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you think God
is a man or woman?

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I think God is a spirit.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Jesus told us that
God is a spirit.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And those who worship
Him must worship Him

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:90%
in spirit and in truth.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
principles that,

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.904 align:middle line:84%
if you live by that, if you
worship Him, if you worship

00:37:30.904 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:90%
God with your spirit--

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
stay on your knees

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.320 align:middle line:84%
in front of the altar
lighting candles.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going by any of that.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It's with the
spirit that is you.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.380 align:middle line:90%
You worship God.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
In truth, you will
have a better life.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we seekers today more
than ever, more than we were?

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well we're back to where it's
a trend to be spiritual now.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And so people are not as afraid.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
We live by our peers' opinions.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And if our peers
think that it's not--

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
or if it's not the
fashionable thing to do,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:90%
then we don't do it.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be the
fashionable thing to do now.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And so people are not afraid.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But they have
always been seekers.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And there have always
been people telling us.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:84%
If you look back
in your history,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.360 align:middle line:84%
there were always
people telling us

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that, if we would
obey the principles,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.010 align:middle line:84%
learn the principles,
life would be better.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But when I tell you
what God can do,

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.787 align:middle line:90%
you may not want to accept it.

00:38:32.787 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
know it's the truth.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It's been publicized.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> You see?

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:84%
They done counted me
dead so many times.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.196 align:middle line:90%
>> They did, more than once.

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So I have credentials.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.430 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
tell you what I hope

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.110 align:middle line:84%
He's going to do what,
I think He'll do,

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:90%
what He might do if whatever--

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you exactly,
definitely that God heals.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I was supposed to be
dead before I hit the ground.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but you weren't.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That was in 1979.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.122 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:39:03.122 --> 00:39:03.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh?

00:39:03.922 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I tell you
God is a healer,

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you have to believe
He is a healer.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the doctors
say you can't

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:15.350 align:middle line:84%
be healed from an aneurysm
rupturing in your brain.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only did one rupture,
when they went in to fix that,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
on the other side there were
two more about to rupture.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So 10 days later, they were
back in there and fixed those.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like it never
happened to me.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Right after this
interview, my good friend Gary

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, the producer of
the program you're watching

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:84%
spoke privately with Della about
aneurysms, the fears she faced,

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.020 align:middle line:90%
the surgery.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:84%
He knew she'd been
down this road before.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he was about
to face a similar surgery.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:84%
She was so moved by
their conversation

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.370 align:middle line:84%
that she was
compelled to carry out

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:84%
God's work with him at her
church service the next day.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:10%
>> After the interview and I
had talked about the fact that I

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:10%
had had an aneurysm to rupture
in my brain and that there were

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.500 align:middle line:10%
two on the other side about
to rupture, he said to me,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:10%
"I'm having brain
surgery next week."

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's been on my heart
ever since he told me.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I said what was in me
to say at that time.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But last night, laying there
in my bed, if he'll let me,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I have to touch him.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:90%
We have to pray for him.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have to support him to
go and do what he has to do.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:84%
May I have your
consciousness for this?

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I need your
consciousness for this.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Chantal, come with me.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.223 align:middle line:90%
You know him better than I do.

00:40:47.223 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Come with me.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.135 align:middle line:84%
Don't let this
frighten you, please.

00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Come to me.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.275 align:middle line:90%
This is a young man.

00:41:00.275 --> 00:41:01.145 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:01.145 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:90%
A young man.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And the books,
the medical books,

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:84%
tell you things that
make you afraid.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And fear will kill you.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that he is
a child of God.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And inside of him
is all the power

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that he needs to do
whatever he needs to do.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I want you to make
a circle around him.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, baby, get around him.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Hold on now, and give
me your consciousness.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, ain't nobody
in here but me and you

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.016 align:middle line:90%
and this man and God.

00:41:34.016 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And all the rest
of these people,

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:84%
if they're not helping us,
they are not hurting us,

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:90%
because God is here.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I thank you Father.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And I can stand that witness
that you are a healer

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and you have no
respect of person.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is your son and
he is trusting in you.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And you will go
in there with him

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and bring him out in the
name of Christ, Jesus.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I accept that this is so.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, it is so.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.194 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> And so it is.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ah, ah, oh, oh, oh.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.148 align:middle line:90%
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.

00:42:28.148 --> 00:42:29.124 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:42:29.124 --> 00:42:33.028 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.085 align:middle line:84%
They have to do what
they have to do.

00:42:44.085 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
do it really well.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it frighten you.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:90%
God will not leave you.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.930 align:middle line:90%
He will not forsake you.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And this-- he made this brain.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:90%
His was the original, you know?

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:90%
He made this brain.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So he knows everything
about this brain.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Listen to him.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:90%
He'll speak to you.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.152 align:middle line:84%
When you're like
that, listen to Him.

00:43:04.152 --> 00:43:04.951 align:middle line:90%
Trust Him.

00:43:04.951 --> 00:43:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Have faith in him.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.474 align:middle line:90%
He won't let you down.

00:43:07.474 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:90%
He won't let you down.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I really thought I wouldn't
ever live another minute.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They told me I should have been
dead before I hit the floor.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1979.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:90%
This is 2000.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here and stronger
and better than I ever was.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It was just an experience that
let me know that God loved me.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Trust in Him, baby, trust God.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Just trust God, just trust God.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Just trust Him.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.908 align:middle line:84%
No matter what they
say, you trust Him, OK?

00:43:35.908 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh Jesus, ooh Jesus, Jesus.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Father.

00:43:47.482 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Father.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you hear him say, I'm
right here and I'm healing

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:90%
you?"

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In Genesis, it said, "He
worked so many days and then He

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:90%
rested."

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Where did he rest?

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:90%
In you and in me.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.090 align:middle line:90%
That's where he is.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So why do I have to look
around and see if he's here?

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:90%
He's inside me.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you why,
because you're scared.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you know He's
inside, how can you be scared?

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home to my momma.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe you.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I know it's true.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, the thing is
you don't really know.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.705 align:middle line:10%
When you really know--

00:44:23.705 --> 00:44:26.690 align:middle line:10%
see, and that's
where salvation is,

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.060 align:middle line:10%
when you really
know and you know

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:10%
that you know what you know.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So when something
comes up, you're

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:84%
not afraid, because God
is going to handle it.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It may not be today.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It may not be Tuesday.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It may not be next Sunday.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But all I have to do is
stand here on my faith.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:90%
He knows I need help.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:90%
He's going to take care of me.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a different attitude
from, "Oh God, won't you

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.750 align:middle line:84%
please come down from
heaven and stand by me?"

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You could be hit by a truck
by the time He got down

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:90%
from heaven, wherever that is.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Which brings us all the way
back to the beginning of this

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:90%
interview with faith.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.680 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a time that
you discover it yourself

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.446 align:middle line:90%
and you say, "Oh, He's there."

00:45:11.446 --> 00:45:13.517 align:middle line:84%
We don't know it when
we're tiny little things.

00:45:13.517 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You did know it when you
were a tiny little thing.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I did?

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> You absolutely did.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it now.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you knew it.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:90%
You really knew it then.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You didn't question it then.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Bible said, "You
have to come as a little child.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you didn't
question anything."

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:29.354 align:middle line:84%
Your momma was scared to
death you'd be up a tree.

00:45:29.354 --> 00:45:31.061 align:middle line:84%
She'd go, "Oh, get
down before you fall."

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You never knew nothing
about no falling.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:33.460 align:middle line:90%
The tree was there.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.230 align:middle line:90%
You climbed up it.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:35.313 align:middle line:90%
And you was having a ball.

00:45:35.313 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get scared until
she told you to get scared.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.320 align:middle line:84%
When your momma, who is
your first great leader,

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
said to you, "Oh, you're
going to fall," you held on.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But until that time,
you was up there

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:84%
swinging your legs
and your feet.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And you was having a ball.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you really
knew God then.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You had no feeling at all that
something would happen to you.

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you just left
God, you really knew.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But then we train
that out of you.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We say, "If you climb
a tree, you will fall."

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But then 20 years later,
we say, "Go climb Mt.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Kilimanjaro."

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.730 align:middle line:90%
That proves that you're a man.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, I couldn't climb the tree.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
climb this mountain?

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You have sung so many songs
and read so many passages from

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the Bible and done
so many sermons.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Right now for today as
we sit in this house,

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is there something that sums up
who you are in the world today?

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope not.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing?

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope I haven't come
to a sum up position.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm going to do
some tomorrow nobody ever

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.120 align:middle line:90%
thought I was going to do.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be spectacular.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.241 align:middle line:84%
And I'll been known
for that tomorrow,

00:46:50.241 --> 00:46:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and then Thursday of next
week do something else

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and be known altogether
new for that new thing

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I did on Thursday.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I might as well give
it up because I'm at the end.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:04.154 align:middle line:84%
>> You, my friend, will
never be at the end ever.

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for the most
extraordinary conversation.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.611 align:middle line:90%
>> God bless you for having me.

00:47:07.611 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.770 align:middle line:84%
God bless you and keep you
and your audience, too.
