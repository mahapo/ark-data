>> I discovered that
to believe in humanity,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and to have the personal
decision that you will not let

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
evil and the misdoings of
others drag you down was very

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
fundamental.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Love is something extraordinary.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And we should pay more attention
to words like peace, hope,

faith, thankfulness, and so on.

is a man of peace.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He labored behind the
scenes at the United Nations

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
for nearly 40 years before
his retirement in 1986.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:84%
A decade later in 1996, he
received the prestigious Albert

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Schweitzer award for his
humanitarian efforts.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
His unfailing energy in working
towards a world without borders

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
has earned him the
title of global citizen.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Robert George Muller
was born in 1923.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
In his early years he lived
through political turmoil

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Alsace-Lorraine
region of France.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Without moving, his
grandparents were

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
claimed as citizens of five
successive nationalities,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
as this region was repeatedly
conquered, the result of three

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:90%
major European wars.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
As a child, he often
looked out the window

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:90%
at a border he could not cross.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And dreamed of the day when he,
like the clouds and the birds,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.741 align:middle line:10%
would not have to be confined
by man-made divisions.

>> During World War II Mr.
Muller experienced the horrors

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:90%
of war.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
First, as a member of
the French resistance,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
where he endured
the Nazi occupation.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he suffered as
a prisoner of war.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And later, became a refugee.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:10%
When he finally
returned home, he

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:10%
enrolled in the
University of Strasbourg,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:10%
earning a doctorate of law.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Then in 1948 he entered
an essay contest,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:10%
writing about how to
best govern the world.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
He won first prize, an
internship at the newly created

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:90%
United Nations.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
For the next four decades Dr.
Muller met with world leaders,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at humanity from
a global perspective,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and envisioning ways to improve
life on the planet Earth.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:84%
He rose to the ranks at the
UN, and eventually became

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
an assistant to the
Secretary General.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Because of his optimistic
views about man's ability

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to live in peace and
take care of the Earth,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
he is known as the
"Prophet of Hope."

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Muller, what a pleasure
and a privilege it is for me

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:10%
to sit down and talk with you.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I thank you so much.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:90%
You have accomplished so much.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:10%
You have lived the life of three
men, as far as I'm concerned,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:10%
with all that you have
done in your life.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But the basis of all you
do and all you write about

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:90%
is happiness.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Why happiness?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Why not ambition, or
drive, or dissatisfaction?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it was a
perception I had as a child

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
My father told me that
when I was a four-year-old

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I was going around saying
that life was divine.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.505 align:middle line:84%
And I took this word
"divine," because it

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest objective I
could find to give my view of

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:90%
to be alive.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
For me to be alive was something
absolutely extraordinary.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
To see old people.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
My father was surprised that
I took off my cap each time

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
there was an old man,
all the old ladies.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Why you do that?

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Because they know so much.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that some
day I will know as

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
much as these old people know.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So for me, life was something
absolutely extraordinary.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And by having this
feeling towards life,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt that happiness
was almost a duty.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I was a happy child,
because all this around me

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:90%
was an incredible miracle.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
For me, happiness is still the
objective of the human being.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that people
can make a conscious decision

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to become happy if
they are not happy?

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, definitely.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened to
me quite a number of times.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
At one point the Germans stopped
me at the border, arrested me,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:90%
and we were in a Gestapo prison.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't even lie down.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It was filled with people.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And you had a pail somewhere
for doing your necessities.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It was so awful I couldn't
imagine that something

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:90%
like this could happen.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, how can I be
happy in a place like this?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I can decide to be happy.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:90%
But how would you do that?

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It just happened that
I had a pencil, which

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:90%
they didn't take off my coat.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
through the prison.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I also said, let
me go to the door.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
there at the door.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And with this pencil
I wrote a novel.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined that I was
living on a hill falling

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
in love with a beautiful girl,
and I was out of this prison.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I decided to be with
my mind elsewhere.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of this, I
was happy even in that prison.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get my happiness.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> People watching this
broadcast would say,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I like the idea.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I like the concept.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:90%
But I am unhappy.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to find happiness.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I have a dream that
I want to come true.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
step that person

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:90%
takes to go in that direction?

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there
would be two things.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The first one is to
remember your early youth.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
What was your dream
when you were a child?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
That gives you an idea
of what you can still do,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
even if society has put
you into another direction.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it even
when you're very old,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
when you're free,
when you are retired.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what I always
say to the old people.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Fulfill now the dream you
had when you were a child.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And once you see this, and
once you have your dream

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and begin to work on it, then
you're immediately uplifted.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And you find the happiness.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is
that usually the dream

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:90%
becomes fulfilled.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I was
dreaming as a kid

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that the border which I saw
from my window disappeared.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And it disappeared.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So then dreams have power.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Dreams are some extraordinary
expansion of your capacities,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and what you could be able
to do if you do not see

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:90%
the obstacles.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.891 align:middle line:84%
And when you dream then
there comes the idea.

00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:90%
The idea follows the dream.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, after having the dream,
this is what you can do.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you start with this?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So that the idea is a concrete
manifestation of the way

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.230 align:middle line:90%
of fulfilling your dream.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I've written
all the thousands of ideas.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And if they do not come
into practice immediately,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:90%
it might be later.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It might even be
after your death.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of those
dreams, let's look at them.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I've read
some of your dreams

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
that you have written about.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
that I particularly love.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know how you
think they can come true.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:10%
This is from your book of "Ideas
and Dreams for a Better World."

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Idea number 1,859.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:90%
You're right, Dr. Muller.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You do have quite a
few ideas and dreams.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:10%
"Wonder has been a
permanent part of my being

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:10%
during my life.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:10%
In my elderly years it
has reached its maximum.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Have a sense of wonder for
your magical, divine life.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And for all the miracles
that surround you."

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me about how we can
find wonder in our lives

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:90%
if we don't have it.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's again a
creation of your being.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You see, maybe for a
long period of my life

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I was not thinking
in terms of wonder.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
As we talked about
before, I was dreaming.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a feeling of
the miracle of life.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older and
older, and wrote this,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I found another dimension
is the dimension of wonder.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It is that when
you wake up and you

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
look at the sky in
the morning, and you

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
see the forest in Costa Rica
being awaken under the sun,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
this is almost a dream.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:90%
It is a miracle.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But what it does to
me as a human being

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
is a sense of wonder.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Would it help us, Dr.
Muller, if we asked the universe

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
or a power greater
than ourselves, or God,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:90%
show me a sense of wonder.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Give it to me so
that I may have it.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And you'll get it.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Then I'll get it.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Idea number 1,782.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
"The word 'retirement
age' should be abolished,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and be replaced by a new
word like 'fulfillment age.'"

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I even call it "refirement."

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I cannot accept to
retire from anything.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I left the
United Nations I said now

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I have total freedom.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And I am now 77 years old.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I've never felt so good.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I am free at the
University for Peace.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
I work there for one dollar a
year so they cannot give me any

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:90%
order.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I give my free services.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I am in Costa Rica in a
demilitarized country.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I can write, I can come up with
my dreams, I can make speeches.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I can walk in a
wonderful nature.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is not retirement.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, even when I
was in the big United Nations

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I was on top of the world.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But after leaving the United
Nations I didn't lose anything.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I found the whole nature of
Costa Rica, of the tropics

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So that with my leaving
the United Nations

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I found even an expansion
of my own being.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Muller, I find you
to be a man who is so alive.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Are you at all afraid of dying?

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't like
the idea of dying.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, by
taking this attitude

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.820 align:middle line:84%
of having so much to do, so
many dreams, so many ideas,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:90%
you have no time to get sick.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And you have no time to get old.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of being
old is completely

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:90%
excluded from my mind.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And I pray God to let me live
as long as possible in order

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to do as much as possible.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I live in such
a way to be healthy,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and not to take
any drugs, alcohol,

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
or things of this sort,
to sleep from 7 o'clock

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
in the evening and
nine hours every night,

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
because I go to bed at a time
when the roosters go to bed.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they wake me up
at 4:00 in the morning

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
so that I am in tune
with the nature.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And to live as long as possible.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Idea 1,902.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Every UN delegate, speaking,
should have before him a heart

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:10%
stick like the
indigenous people have,

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:10%
to remind them that they
should speak from the heart.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And you even say, "I
use such a stick."

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this stick and
how it would help the world.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It is to remind you
always that when you speak,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
you must also speak
with the heart.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we Westerners will speak
mostly with the intelligence.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And very seldom do we dare
to use the word "love."

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Recently, at the
University for Peace,

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a course,
a girl student, when

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I ended the course with a
speech as the chancellor,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
she said, Mr. Muller, you do
not know how much I thank you.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I've taken this
three-months course and I've

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:90%
never heard the word "love."

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And in your final speech
you used it three times.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:84%
The distance between
the brain and the heart

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%
is only 18 inches.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make a conduit
between the heart upstairs.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And the stick reminds you--

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
reminds indigenous people
never to forget the heart.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And our Western society
is too cerebral.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't speak enough of love.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We should speak about
love, happiness.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:90%
All these great concepts.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Compassion.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Taking care of people.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
These are the great
concepts which

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:90%
have always guided humanity.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And one thing which
is also important,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and which I remember
from youth, it

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is to be in union
with the universe.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
In other words, not only the
total planet and the total

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:90%
humanity, but the universe.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And this I got,
again, as a child.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But what you're talking
about is a reverence for life.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Reverence for life.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Is what's happening
right now a dream?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, it's a dream that
I'm able to tell you this.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Because my dream
is that really what

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I have learned from life,
these extraordinary lessons,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the 20th
century and the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I would like to give
this to the world.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I would like to make the whole
world learn how to be happy,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and not to think negatively,
to think always optimistically

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and positively.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Because optimistic
is always better,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
even if it does not
succeed than pessimism.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself a progress report.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing on your dream?

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Your desire to teach
us, to teach the world

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
not to think negatively, to open
yourself to the cosmic forces.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
How are you doing on
your mission, doctor?

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's not yet very far.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:10%
But it is much better than
I could have ever expected.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
If anyone would have told me
that the border in my home town

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:90%
would disappear--

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
if anyone would have told
me that I would survive

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
all the Gestapos and
the Second World War,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
where I could have been
killed a half a dozen times--

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
if anyone would have told me
that my dream to work for peace

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
would be fulfilled, and that
I would enter the United

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Nations with an essay
immediately after the Second

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
World War-- and that three days
before retiring from the United

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Nations I would be appointed
the Chancellor of a University

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
for Peace in a
demilitarized country.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And that there are 34 Robert
Muller schools who are teaching

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
the children what
we are saying here.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:90%
To teach them happiness.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a Robert Muller school
which I visited in Texas.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.102 align:middle line:84%
And then the caretaker
in the courtyard

00:16:25.102 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
said, Mr. Muller,
I don't know what

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:84%
they are teaching to
these children in there,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
but I've never seen two
children fight each other.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:90%
How do they succeed this?

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said for a
very simple reason.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Because on the day the
children come to the schools--

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and the mothers already
tell them in their womb,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
they are told that
they are a miracle.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And that they should be happy
to be alive when we know

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:90%
so much about the universe.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
More than any king
and emperor in time.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.445 align:middle line:84%
They should be proud
to be alive today.

00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And that they will
have a great--

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
they can have a
great role in life.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the children, they
say, well, if I'm a miracle

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and he's a miracle how
can I hurt a miracle?

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I would say that your
progress report is a pretty

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:90%
good one.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Not bad.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Not bad.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.608 align:middle line:90%
>> But not good enough.

00:17:12.608 --> 00:17:15.982 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> During his four decades
at the United Nations, Dr.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Muller watched it grow from a
gathering of a mere 51 nations

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%
to become a world authority.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
He presided over early
efforts to conduct

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
a worldwide population count.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
He projected birth rates,
and medical advances

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:90%
that would increase longevity.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
He warned of the
potential difficulties

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to the biosphere with
uncontrolled population growth.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:10%
And then in 1972,
he presided over

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:10%
the first worldwide
conference on the environment

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:10%
held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:10%
One of your great
accomplishments, Dr. Muller,

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:10%
is more than 40 years of
service with the United Nations.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I think that's remarkable.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people today, though,
say that the UN is outdated,

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and there is no longer
a need for that.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts on that?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the United
Nations, in my opinion,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:10%
is really probably one of the
most important things that has

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:10%
happened in this century.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
When the World War II was
over and I joined the UN

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I was a very
pessimistic young man.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:90%
If the French and the Germans--

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
two white highly
civilized countries--

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
had three wars in the lifetime
of my grandparents and parents,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
how can I expect that communists
and capitalists, rich and poor,

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to thousands of religions,
so many ethnic groups

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and languages, that they
are going to make it?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I was almost sure
that within 20 years

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
there would be something
else that would trigger off

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
World War III.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And it hasn't happened.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:84%
When I go to New York
in the first United

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Nations in an
abandoned war factory,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
a Belgian delegate asked me,
what you're coming to do here,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
young man?

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, I come here
to work for peace,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
because I do not
want my children

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to see the horrors I
have seen in this war.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I pity you,
because you will lose your job.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
This organization will not
last more than five years.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And the United Nations still
exists, has become universal.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the metabiological
organization

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
of the human species that
has to look into everything.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
The outer space, the population,
the climate of the world,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:90%
the future population.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
What will the world
be in 100 years?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%
In 1,000 years.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the biggest central
brain of the human species.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What if there was a
world symposium somewhere,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
specifically about global
consciousness and spirituality?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Would people come to that?

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I have
created, with Dr. Karan Singh

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
of India, a World Commission
of Eminent Personalities

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
on Global Consciousness
and Spirituality.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's done then.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And we are going
to have a meeting,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
which is planned now in Spain
in October of next year,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to bring together the most
eminent people from around

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
the world in order to
look precisely into this.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Namely to have the
consciousness of the universe,

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
our planet, and to have

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
the religions to cooperate
in this global consciousness.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Create your dream.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Who would you like to be there?

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we will
invite presidents.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll invite the Dalai Lama.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We'll invite the Secretary
General of the UN.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We have some of the
best thinkers on Earth

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
who are perhaps
not so much known.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We will invite Ted Turner
and people like this

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to really reach finally
this global consciousness

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Beyond the nations.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that possible?

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to do it.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, do not consider
anything impossible.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This is why I speak so much
about the world in my books,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and for 18 books so far.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And then my 4,000
ideas is always this.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.907 align:middle line:84%
You must love the
earth as your home.

00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a good teacher for me.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I, like many people
watching this broadcast,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
might say sorry, Dr. Muller,
but that's impossible.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not just love everybody.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But I shouldn't say
it's impossible.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Never say that's impossible.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:90%
This planet is our home.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Look, in Europe we were able
to suppress for 15 borders.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.404 align:middle line:84%
Now Europe is the love
of all the Europeans.

00:22:13.404 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And they fought
each other before.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:10%
Now the French and
the Germans are--

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:10%
they're married, or can
settle anywhere in Europe.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:10%
You have a European
Court of Human Rights.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a miracle that
you have transformed

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
countries which killed each
other for all these centuries.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Now they are Europeans.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a
thought to consider.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
You are a medical doctor.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The planet, Earth,
is your patient.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:90%
What's the prognosis?

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, we have
a World Health Organization that

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
has all the works of the
doctors around the world.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I have recommended that we
should have an Earth Health

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Organization.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>> An Earth Health--

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Health Organization.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And that many people should
be the doctors of the Earth.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The healers of the earth.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The problems with the earth
are very, very serious.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:10%
We let every five
hours die a species.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:10%
Every five hours.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Really?

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Every-- oh, yes.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:10%
Every minute we put 12,000 tons
of carbon dioxide into the air.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me get my head wrapped
around the species dying.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You mean like an eagle,
or a kind of a bird,

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:90%
or a kind of a insect.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Every five hours one of
those species is gone?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Every five hours a complete
species on planet disappears.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Ugh.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
When it took millions of
years to create that species.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't imagine it.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are now
six billion people.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
In 1952 there were
two billion people.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:10%
In 2050-- in 50 years from now--

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:10%
we will be three billion
more people on this planet.

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:00.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Three billion?

00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Three billion.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Three billion.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
That is half of the
world population of today

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
will be added to what we are.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:90%
We are six billion.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be 8.9
billion in the year 2050.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So then, doctor, the planet
Earth as your patient sounds

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
like it's sick and
getting sicker.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.940 align:middle line:90%
What do we do to heal it?

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're making
a lot of noise.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I created the first world
environment conference.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I brought together the first
world conference on the climate

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in 1979.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.947 align:middle line:90%
And they say, Muller is crazy.

00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see
in the newspapers?

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That now governments
are trying to save

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:90%
the climate of this planet.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You see, we have done everything
in the preceding period--

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:84%
humanity, humanity,
humanity, humanity.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And we have succeeded.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The longevity has increased
from 40 to 60 years

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
in the poor countries.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to 72 years in
the United States.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
The children's mortality
has almost collapsed,

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
has almost disappeared.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
There are no world
epidemics anymore.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We have done wonders
for humanity.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But we totally forgot
about the earth

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:84%
until in 1972 we discovered that
something was getting wrong,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
the environment.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:10%
We have destroyed 30% of
the nature of this planet

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:10%
since 1970, and we
continue to do it.

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the world
scale it is horrible.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.252 align:middle line:84%
The earth now has become
pre-occupation number one.

00:25:32.252 --> 00:25:35.696 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:35.696 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the
famous Bench of Dreams.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I know there's
one in Costa Rica.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.647 align:middle line:90%
And then more and more places.

00:25:49.647 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>> All over the world there
are Benches of Dreams.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They are beginning
to spread, yes.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> How did the idea come about?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you sit here and
dream up your dreams?

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But also-- and
mostly in Costa Rica,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because we're located on a
sacred mountain, the legend

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
being of the indigenous people
that this is a land of dreams,

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the dreams
will be come true

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.617 align:middle line:90%
when you dreamed on sacred Mt.

00:26:18.617 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Rasur.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Or on these benches.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, on these benches.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me how I would
dream a dream on this bench.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:90%
How do I make it come true?

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you take
two little rocks--

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.085 align:middle line:84%
and there are some
available here--

00:26:33.085 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:90%
you hold one in each hand.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> One in each hand.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You hold them very, very
strongly with a lot of energy.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You close your eyes, and very
strongly you dream your dream.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And after a little while
you reopen your eyes.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll throw one of
the little pebbles on the earth,

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
so that Mother Earth will
help fulfill your dream.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other one you keep
at home on your desk to remember

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:90%
what your dream is.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Bravo.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is my dream.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.566 align:middle line:90%
>> That is your dream.

00:27:21.566 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Robert Muller's idea
for a Bench of Dreams

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
originated in the lush
countryside of Costa Rica,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
where he spends
half of his time.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The rustic Muller farmhouse
can be found near Mt.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Rasur in an area
considered sacred

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.485 align:middle line:90%
by the indigenous people.

00:27:40.485 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Your University for
Peace in Costa Rica,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:10%
what does one learn when
one goes there as a student?

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:10%
What is the purpose?

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.925 align:middle line:10%
>> Peace.

00:27:53.925 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
To teach peace in
every possible way,

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and to teach also
peace with the earth.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:10%
So in other words, that
there are two main purposes.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Avoid violence-- how
to avoid violence,

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
how to teach the children
not to be violent,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:84%
how to get peace
between nations,

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to get peace between everybody.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is to
have the right relationship

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:84%
with nature, and not
to destroy nature.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when we destroy nature
it's a war against nature.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So there would be classes
like environment, one on one.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, definitely.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Definitely.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:10%
Now the students, they
have already a degree.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They have to have either a
master's degree or a PhD,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and they come from
around the world.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So that they get this additional
specialized teaching of helping

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:90%
to have peace in the world.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And to create peace
ministries, and to have

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.270 align:middle line:84%
peace education, whatever
you can in schools and so on.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And the students, after
they've graduated from

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:84%
the Peace University in Costa
Rica, they go on to do what?

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they go into the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They go into
various professions.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They go to a Peace
Corps, whatever.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:84%
That is up to them to find it,
but they have already an idea

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
before coming to the
University for Peace.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They have all
already an objective.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to the
University for Peace

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:84%
because I want to work on peace
in the Ministry of Education,

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to go
into politics, and I

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:84%
want to become a
peacemaker in politics.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to return
to central Africa

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to make peace between
the ethnic groups.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have heroes?

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you have people you
look at it and you say,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
what a wondrous, wondrous
human being he is--

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:90%
or she is.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.506 align:middle line:90%
Who are your heroes?

00:29:42.506 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think a man
like Dag Hammarskjold,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:10%
who from being a tremendous
economist intellectual,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:10%
became a mystic in
the United Nations.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Another man was
secretary-general, U Thant,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.540 align:middle line:84%
who was the Buddhist
mystic, who was very simple.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Very-- you cannot imagine
how simple he was.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he said to me,
Robert, I cannot understand you

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Westerners who go to the church
on Sunday to be spiritual

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:90%
for an hour.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I am spiritual from the moment
I wake up until the evening when

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I go to bed.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.060 align:middle line:90%
All my life is spirituality.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had to push him to
be strong as the Secretary

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.250 align:middle line:90%
General.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
speaking of dreams,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:84%
when I was appointed
to him people

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
told me, oh, he's only going
to stay two more years.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.489 align:middle line:90%
There's not much to expect.

00:30:38.489 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I'm
not going to lose

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:84%
my time with a Secretary General
who is not audacious and so on.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So the first day
when we met I said,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.496 align:middle line:84%
do you have any
unfulfilled dreams?

00:30:50.496 --> 00:30:53.460 align:middle line:90%
He looked at me very surprised.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, I
have three dreams.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that the United
Nations doesn't make sense

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
without China being here,
which is millions of people.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, I'm sick
and tired sometimes

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
to listen always to this
political and economic

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.200 align:middle line:90%
speeches.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I would like to hear
a spiritual voice.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And thirdly, I would like--

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm a teacher.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that without
teaching and education

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:90%
we will have no peace.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to see maybe a
university for peace created.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's work on it.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:84%
First speech for him, return
of China to the United Nations.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Priority item number
one on the world agenda.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And China was voted
back to the UN.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And thank God to it,
because today we do not

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:90%
have a Cold War with China.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine?

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.240 align:middle line:10%
Secondly, I said
to him, look, you

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:10%
can ask the pope
to come and speak.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
He's the head of a little
state-- the Vatican state.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.110 align:middle line:90%
We can invite the pope to come.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, wonderful.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:90%
You invite the pope.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I invited the Pope John Paul II.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:90%
He came.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I go all the Cardinals
assembled in front of him

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:90%
in their garments.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was a wonderful day.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They asked me--
the pope would like

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to give you a gift at
the end of his visit

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:90%
to the United Nations.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
to get from him?

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I would like
to have a little crucifix--

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
very modest-- which
belong to himself.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
And you know what he gave me?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
This golden cross
which belonged to him.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:84%
That was the gift of the
pope for the invitation

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.940 align:middle line:90%
to come to the United Nations.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The pope gave you this?

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Gave me that cross.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful dream.

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine?

00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, I got the
University for Peace created.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
By that time, unfortunately,
U Thant had left, and died.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:90%
But we fulfilled his dream.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that there would
be world peace if we all had

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.640 align:middle line:90%
the same spiritual framework?

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It would do enormously.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is now going
to happen at long

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:26.190 align:middle line:84%
last, because the
religions have decided

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to work together around the
concept of global spirituality.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, one of my first
books was called "New Genesis.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The Birth of a
Global Spirituality."

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So that all the religions
would get together.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I made a speech in the
World Parliament of Religions

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:90%
in 1990.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I said, for heaven's sake,
create a united religions

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:90%
like the United Nations.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And Bishop Desmond Tutu,
the Nobel Prize winner,

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:90%
listened to me.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, then
don't wait another 100

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:84%
years to have the next
Parliament of Religions.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And he convened it
in South Africa.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So that the Parliament
of Religions

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:08.055 align:middle line:84%
can become the General
Assembly of the Religious.

00:34:08.055 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:90%
And now they work together.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
talk about is something called

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
"ka-put-alism".

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.949 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING]

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> What on Earth is that?

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have the word "dahs
kah-pi-tahl" of Karl Marx.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
is [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.550 align:middle line:90%
because it is German.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And since I predicted capitalism
is now going to take the same

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
way as communism, namely it's
no longer an economic viable

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:84%
system for the world, so
I call it "ka-put-alism"

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.700 align:middle line:90%
because "kaput" means--

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So capitalism will be kaput.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:90%
>> It will be kaput.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK!

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:10%
What would happen if we in
the world simply smiled more?

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:10%
If we made an effort
to smile more.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:10%
In interviews like
this, on the street.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:10%
What if we all smiled more?

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It will be fantastic.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It will be fantastic,
because the face

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:90%
reflects the whole philosophy.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you smile,
well, you are upwards.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.170 align:middle line:90%
You are optimistic.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
If you are very
unhappy, even the body

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:90%
sags to a certain point.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So that smiles and
the face speaks.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always
impressed by a man

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
who was the president of
Costa Rica, Rodrigo Carazo,

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and who came to
the United Nations

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to propose the creation of
the University for Peace.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And this man, he
smiles constantly.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I tried to imitate
him but I can't.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's always-- you
must will to smile.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that interesting?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The mere mention of
him makes me smile.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You see?

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The president of a
country who always smiles.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's lovely.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:90%
That's lovely.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
How would you say is
the best way for us

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to educate children to think
of the world in this way?

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> To decide to educate them.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:90%
That is the first step.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.460 align:middle line:84%
If you decide to educate
the children in peace

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:84%
you will have so many
examples and models.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I see
that is so distressing to me--

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.100 align:middle line:84%
something simple--
toys for children,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:44.310 align:middle line:84%
video games for children, where
they are nothing but violence.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Nothing but killing.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
this should be avoided

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:90%
by the parents.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:84%
They can do a lot
already by the teachers.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And there are
countries like Sweden

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:84%
where they have even agreement
with the toy manufacturers

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
not to produce any
war and violence toys.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Now can you imagine that in
Sweden the toy manufacturers

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:84%
are producing peace
toys and never war toys?

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>> No war toys?

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> No war toys
anymore whatsoever.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't produce them.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So in Sweden you
cannot buy a war toy.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Or a war game.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It is all peace games.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Even their video games?

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:90%
No squirt guns?

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Astonishing.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.664 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was an agreement
between the government

00:37:33.664 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and the Swedes.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times have you been
nominated for the Nobel Peace

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Prize?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, quite a few times.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, quite a few.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Even by Nobel Prize winners.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the nicest recommendation
for me as the Nobel Peace Prize

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:84%
was from Betty
Williams, for what

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I've done for the children.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you really not know?

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you know it's about 19 times
that you've been nominated?

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody told me this.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You see again I come to
what I said at the beginning.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.560 align:middle line:84%
When you do something
positive some strange forces

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:90%
begin to work in your direction.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you have dreams,
where you have ideas,

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:84%
you are recompensed 10 times
by incredible happiness

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and successes.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know as I sit
here, enjoying immensely this

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:84%
conversation with you, I'm very
aware of a phrase that you use

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.430 align:middle line:90%
a lot.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:90%
You say, can you imagine?

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
is kind of a request

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.600 align:middle line:90%
to go ahead and imagine it.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Because when we imagine
something what happens?

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It occurs.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the first step.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the first step.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
If you do not imagine
it will not happen.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
value of the human being.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That he can imagine.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes a reality.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Is your definition of
happiness different today than

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.770 align:middle line:90%
it was 30 years ago?

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's the same,
but it's more expanded today.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm more optimistic
about a happy world

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
than I was when I came out
of the Second World War.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But we must keep in
mind that we have

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
completely new problems which
didn't exist at that time.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.270 align:middle line:84%
In the charter of
the United Nations

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.420 align:middle line:84%
there's no word
"earth" or "nature."

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That was not a
problem at the time.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That was what year?

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That was in 1945.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we have
now the University

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:84%
for Peace-- the
Earth Council, which

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is located at the
University for Peace

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:90%
has produced an Earth Charter.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have a United
Nations Charter,

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and we have an Earth Charter,
where the earth is speaking.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And you will see in my
"Thousands of Ideas"

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
it's the Earth speaking
to me all the time.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Dear Robert, what do
they do this to me?

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Whereas years ago, it
would have never have

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
occurred to me before 1972 even
to think so much for the Earth.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:90%
The earth was taken for granted.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
talk about that I actually

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:84%
aspire to in your book
of "Ideas and Dreams,"

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is the importance of
living more frugally--

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in a more frugal way.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.068 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you talk about
that a little bit for me?

00:40:24.068 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:10%
>> That is absolutely essential.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:10%
Because a person in
the Western world

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:35.880 align:middle line:10%
today consumes 30 times what
a person in a poor country

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.680 align:middle line:10%
consumes.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And all the waste that goes
here in every direction.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why
the University for Peace

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.540 align:middle line:84%
we have taken Saint
Francis as our Saint,

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
he has a beautiful
monument there--

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
it is because in
Saint Francis we

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
found the same ideals which we
have at University for Peace,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:03.660 align:middle line:84%
namely peace, respect,
and love for nature.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:90%
And simple and frugal living.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And for me, simple
and frugal living

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it makes your
body function better.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And you are not
sold out to things.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's define
it a little bit.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's unpack a little bit.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.287 align:middle line:84%
Because people watching
this will say, well,

00:41:23.287 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.994 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't go out--

00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It is not to waste
things as we do.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:90%
For example, to have cornflake--

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to have something very easy
for breakfast in the morning.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Not hundreds of various,
various things around you.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
knows what is is

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to have a simple, frugal life.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, live more
generally in less things.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Even I myself, I have too
many things around myself.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And I refuse to live
in a modern house

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:90%
on our mountain in Costa Rica.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an old peasant house
which I have restored.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And people say, why do
you live in this cabin?

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, my wife, at
first she was shocked.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Today she doesn't want
to live anywhere else.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you can flood
a little dwelling,

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
a little cabin,
with all the love

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.980 align:middle line:90%
of God and of the universe.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And the spirits
of the people who

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.170 align:middle line:84%
lived there in the 19th
century, they are still around.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You can love something
which is very simple.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I prefer that simple cabin in
Costa Rica to a luxurious home.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a kind of decision.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
of it is that you

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:90%
want to be more yourself.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:90%
This is very, very important.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Here I have an anecdote,
which is important.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Not long ago there was a teacher
with a group of students.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, Mr. Muller,
what a wonderful nature

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:90%
this university is located in.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, it is much
better than in a crowded city.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Here nature gives you
peace all the time.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You can look at this beautiful
nature without end, for hours.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Among my students
there is a girl--

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful girl-- who
is always depressed.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Very, very unhappy.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I tried everything to make her
feel happy, and it didn't work.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And when she came
to this university

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I said, let us not be inside.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Let us go outside in
the middle of nature.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's just sit down and look
at the beauty of nature.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And after a while I saw
that the girl was crying.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her,
what's happening?

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Why do you cry?

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:56.980 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's the first time
in my life that I found myself.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you imagine?

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the first time in
my life that I found myself.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we're doing
a documentary on wisdom.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:90%
About silence.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And the power of silence.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> The power of silence.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What are your
thoughts on silence?

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
What does silence bring to our
lives, from your perspective?

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the innermost--

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.620 align:middle line:90%
you go inside.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
thing is to go inside.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And then you can go outside.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You can give what
you feel inside.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
For me, for my own
life, is you have also

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to look-- what is your rhythm?

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:43.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, my best moments
are very early in the morning

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:90%
when I wake up.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And here I am lying in
my bed next to Barbara.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And for almost an hour the
ideas flood in total silence.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:84%
A whole new philosophy of things
I've never thought before.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening,
if you would ask me,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.780 align:middle line:90%
this would not be the same.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:06.526 align:middle line:84%
In the evening the world
has pressed me down.

00:45:06.526 --> 00:45:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not at my best.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the silence
that does that.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the silence
that does it.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is also the fact that you
had the night of recuperation.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.930 align:middle line:84%
