to other methods, such as
the methods of mutagenesis,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
the purposeful
induction of mutations

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
using toxic chemicals,
radiation, gamma rays, et

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Problem-- you can't control
the mutations you get.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't order up
the mutation you want,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
say, for better pest
resistance or a reduced height.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:90%
You just get this dozens--

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:90%
perhaps hundreds-- of mutations.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
If they're not fatal,
the plant survives.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:10%
But you've induced
numerous mutations.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:10%
So wheat is now-- well,
it's no longer four and 1/2

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:10%
foot, five foot tall, two
meter tall traditional plant.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:10%
It's an 18-inch tall, short,
thick, stocky, semi-dwarf

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:10%
strain, they call it.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So that change in appearance is
accompanied by multiple changes

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
in its genetics, in
its biochemistry,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
in the proteins in particular
that are expressed.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And when products made with
high-yield semi-dwarf wheat

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
were put on store shelves
around 1985 to late '80s,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
that's when we saw an
explosion in numerous problems.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It coincides perfectly
with a dramatic increase

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
in calorie intake in Australia,
US, Western Europe, UK.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It coincides perfectly
with an explosion

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
in autoimmune diseases and in
type 2 diabetes and obesity.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
prove cause and effect.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty well convinced it
is probably a cause and effect.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The wheat we're eating
is not the wheat we ate.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not the bread of
our ancestors, which

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.298 align:middle line:84%
has many more proteins
that create inflammation

00:10:59.298 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
that are gluten proteins.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It also has a much
higher starch content.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, two
tablespoons of sugar

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
raises your blood sugar
less than two slices

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:90%
of whole wheat bread.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that the
kind of wheat we're eating

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:90%
is very inflammatory.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We know that this can
disrupt the gut lining.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:10%
So looking at celiac
disease, 50 years ago,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:10%
they had blood samples
on 10,000 people looking

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:10%
at celiac disease,
and they compared it

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:10%
to a blood sample of
10,000 people today.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:10%
And there was a real increase
of 400% in celiac disease.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is not a fad.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a real phenomenon
that's a result of the increased

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
use of antibiotics, the
lack of breastfeeding,

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
the processed food, and
the chronic stresses,

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
environmental toxins, all
colluding to drive disruptions

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:84%
in the gut function,
which allows the gluten

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to actually break
through and create

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:90%
the systemic inflammation.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. [INAUDIBLE] Fasano at
Harvard published a study that

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:10%
shows when humans eat wheat,
every human that eats wheat--

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:10%
not just the celiacs, but
every human that eats wheat--

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:10%
gets tears in the inside
lining of the gut every time

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.730 align:middle line:10%
they're exposed to wheat.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:10%
>> We now know through clinical
research it is an absolute

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:10%
the autoimmune disease
begins in the gut.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Just as Hippocrates said
over 2,000 years ago,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.668 align:middle line:84%
all disease begins in the gut,
so does autoimmune disease.

00:12:21.668 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So with autoimmune disease,
here's really how it works,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.427 align:middle line:84%
is there is a barrier in
between your bloodstream

00:12:26.427 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
and your intestines.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
It's called your gut lining.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And your gut lining
has microscopic--

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:90%
these little holes in it.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.362 align:middle line:84%
What can happen over
time if somebody

00:12:33.362 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
has intestinal
inflammation, large holes

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:90%
open up in your gut lining.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Some cells turn
over very quickly,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
like the inside
lining of the gut.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Every three to seven days
you have a whole new lining

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:90%
to your gut.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like the skin of a snake.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.038 align:middle line:90%
Just kind of sheds right off.

00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
So you had toast for breakfast.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
You have a sandwich for lunch.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Pasta for dinner.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Croutons on your salad.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:90%
A cookie, but it heals.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Day after week after month after
year after year after year,

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
until one day you
don't heal anymore.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you don't heal,
that's pathogenic intestinal

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:90%
permeability.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And these tears can
occur and stay torn.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
When you lose tolerance
and you don't heal anymore

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
when you're two years old,
22 years old, 72 years old,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it just depends on when you
cross that threshold as to when

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
this happens.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:90%
But it happens.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So what can happen now is
undigested food particles,

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
such as gluten, casein,
toxins, bad bacteria--

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Candida-- can leak
from the intestines

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.363 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:13:36.363 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Your body says, those
shouldn't be here.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:90%
It starts this immune response.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And if that isn't corrected
over time, what can happen

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:90%
is it starts autoimmune disease.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
That systemic inflammation
can affect the joints,

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:90%
causing rheumatoid arthritis.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
thyroid, causing

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
colon, causing things

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
like Crohn's disease, or the
muscles, causing fibromyalgia.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So really, all
autoimmune disease

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
is first caused by leaky gut.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.252 align:middle line:90%
It starts in the gut lining.

00:14:04.252 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I really believe the
biggest factors that

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
are causing this gut
reaction are, number one,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:90%
it's certain foods.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Refined grain products.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is a big one.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Sugar feeds Candida in
yeast in your body, which

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:90%
causes this issue.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%
Genetically modified organisms.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
They're are wired with
pesticides and viruses, which

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:84%
kill off beneficial microbes
in the gut, causing leaky gut

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:90%
and autoimmune disease.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Also looking at
hydrogenated oils.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Artificial sweeteners
are a big one.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
contribute to leaky gut.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you have any
inflammatory condition,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
or really any chronic condition,
gluten should be at the top

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of your list in
thinking about why.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's an autoimmune
disease, digestive disorders,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:10%
depression, neurologic
issues, many of these things

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.215 align:middle line:10%
are driven through gluten.

00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And by doing an
elimination diet,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:10%
you can often see the impact.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:10%
And we've seen athletes like
Djokovic, who's actually

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:10%
accelerated his career by
removing inflammatory foods,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:10%
like gluten and dairy
and sugar, and seeing

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:10%
him go from near the bottom of
the pile of professional tennis

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:10%
players to number
one and unbeatable.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%

information about the change

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:90%
of the diet and nutrition.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
With that change in 2010
and in the years after that,

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt so strong as a
tennis player on the court.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.985 align:middle line:90%
And I recovered better.

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:90%
I had more endurance.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I had more clarity of mind.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:84%

of life open up to me.

The circumstances in life
that I've had after that

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:90%
were phenomenal.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The first tennis tournament
that I ever watched in my life.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm still sleeping.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm still having my dream.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.235 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got the Wimbledon
trophy in your hands.

00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And two days ago, you knew
you'd be the world number one.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been a bad
few days, has it?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Couple of good days
in the office, yeah.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Wimbledon Champion
Novak Djokovic!

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen this play out
many, many, many times.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:84%
That professional athletes--
non-professional athletes--

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
experience dramatic
improvement in performance.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
You'll run faster.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:90%
You'll run farther.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:90%
You bike faster.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Novak
Djokovic, you'll hit harder.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful effect.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's only one thing
you could do to have a healthier

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:90%
body is have a healthier gut.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
more powerful to protect you

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:90%
than a healthy microbiome.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing more powerful
to get optimal brain function

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
than having a
healthy microbiome.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The foods that your gut flora
like are mostly plant foods.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables, nuts
and seeds beans.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Real food.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:90%
High fiber foods.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And even special fibers.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Things like chia
seeds, flax seeds,

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:90%
free biotic types of foods.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.145 align:middle line:90%
Artichokes.

00:18:11.145 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Various kinds of foods
that actually can help

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.547 align:middle line:90%
fertilize the healthy bacteria.

00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And the more you eat of those,
the more healthy bacteria have.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The less sugar and
processed food you have,

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
the better your bacteria are.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regardless of my profession,
everybody wants to be healthy,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
thrive in well-being.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Your body is structured in such
a complex and intelligent way.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's smart enough to heal
itself, to run itself,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
if you are feeding it with
the right information.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.238 align:middle line:84%
Through food, through
your surrounding,

00:18:47.238 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
through whatever
you do in your life.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up with two immigrant
Indian parents that came

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to America really trusting
of the American food system,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and really wanting
to be American.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so me and my
brother growing up,

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
we could eat whatever we
wanted when we were little.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I wanted McDonald's,
I got McDonald's,

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted Wendy's or Burger
King, I would get those.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Every single day, if I wanted.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it was cheap, it
was readily available,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was food
that we were eating.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I was really picky child.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to eat the home
cooked Indian meal my mom was

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:90%
making for herself and my dad.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
It looked funny.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It smelled funny.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I had
known what I know now

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
about all the medicinal
curries and the health

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
qualities of
vegetarian cooking, I

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
would be a totally
different person.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But as a result of my terrible
food habits growing up

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and my lack of education
about nutrition,

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
it led to a lot of
different health issues.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And those health issues--
overcoming asthma,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
eczema, allergies,
endometriosis,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.010 align:middle line:90%
having my appendix taken out.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
All of those episodes
of being in and out

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
of hospitals and
doctor's offices

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
really created passion in
me to start taking back

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:90%
control of my health.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to question
all the things that I had been

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
taught about food and started
to do my own research into what

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
was truly healthy,
my mind was blown.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.653 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
the majority of food

00:20:26.653 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been eating
for most of my life

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
was dead, processed
food that had

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
been invented in a laboratory
full of different chemicals.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Not even tested for human use.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
No wonder my body was sick,
because it wasn't getting

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:90%
the nutrients it needed.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
One of my first
investigations that I did

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
was to compare products being
sold in the United States

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:90%
to other parts of the world.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that our
own American companies

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
were reformulating
our favorite products

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to be healthier for
citizens overseas and not

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
for their own Americans.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
In one product was Kraft
Macaroni and Cheese,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
which, in Europe, if a product
has artificial food dyes,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
it says may cause adverse
effects on activity

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and attention in children.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kraft Foods
had figured that out.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Said, we're not going to put a
warning label on our products

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:90%
overseas.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to take out
that artificial food dye.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
To only take out
artificial food dye

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:84%
for some citizens
across the globe

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and not all citizens
across the globe

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is completely immoral
and unethical.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if they know that
there is an ingredient that

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
could be risky to children, or
could be harmful to children,

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
or contribute to ADHD, or
contribute to hyperactivity,

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I think food corporations
have an obligation

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
to make their products as
healthy across the board.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And so pointing out
that discrepancy

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
opened up a Pandora's
box of food activism.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And social media-- a
frenzy of moms and dads

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and everyone sharing
this information

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
so voraciously to the point
where these corporations

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.227 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do anything
but listen to us

00:22:10.227 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and start to remove
some of these chemicals.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.182 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:15.182 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I cringe at the ways that
humans have managed to profit

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:90%
from these mistakes.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:10%
Those mistakes could be the
overreliance on sugary drinks,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:10%
because the very poor
science that prove--

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:10%
never did, by the way--

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:10%
prove that we need sugars
to perform in sports.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:90%
That's simply not true.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I found out that
over 40 years ago,

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:84%
the sports drink industry
actually paid scientists

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
to convince moms and convince
the public that their child

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
would not be hydrated enough
during regular sports events.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
That their child needed
this extra nourishment.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And that without it, you were
putting your child at risk.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely false.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The majority of children out
there who do sports activities

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.747 align:middle line:84%
need one thing,
and that is water.

00:23:07.747 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It's frightening.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Pepsi makes Gatorade.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And they market it as a health
drink, or as a sports drink,

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:90%
or a hydration drink.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few
electrolytes in there.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's high
fructose corn syrup.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:90%
It's dye.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
trans fats in them.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.593 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty frightening when
you look at the composition

00:23:24.593 --> 00:23:26.158 align:middle line:84%
of these sports
drinks and actually

00:23:26.158 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing to our kids.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Sports drinks full
of artificial food dye.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Artificial food
dye that's linked

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:90%
to hyperactivity in children.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Hyperactivity that's now leading
to more increases in ADHD.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
parents I have spoken to

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and have received
letters from when

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:84%
they remove these
artificial food

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:84%
dyes from their
child's diet, how

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:90%
much their attention improves.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
How they get better at school.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of their
allergies go away.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Their skin issues go away.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:10%
Because these artificial
food dyes not only

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:10%
are linked to hyperactivity.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They're linked to all sorts of
different allergies in kids,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:84%
as well as, in lab
rats, leukemia.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's incredible
technology now been developed

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.960 align:middle line:84%
where you can swallow a camera
that's actually the size

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
of a little tiny
vitamin capsule.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you about
15 hours of footage

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:84%
from inside the
digestive system.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And what the researchers did was
they gave one group of people

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:90%
a homemade meal.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:84%
They actually made
noodles from scratch

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
just from flour and
water and served it

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in a broth made from water and
vegetables and salt and pepper.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
group, they were given

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
bought noodles from
the supermarket

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that come with the sachet
that you add hot water to.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was served with
a blue sports drink.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they
swallowed these cameras

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to give the visuals
of what then went on.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And four hours after they
swallowed the real food meal,

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:10%
all that was left was white
fluff in the digestive system.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's how it's supposed
to be-- really well broken down

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:10%
by that stage.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:10%
But for the people who had
the bought food meal, four

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:10%
hours after they ate it
and swallowed the camera,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:10%
you can still see the
teeth marks in the noodles.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:10%
So what that suggests
is if you have

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:10%
food in your digestive
system for four hours,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:10%
exposed to all of your
digestive enzymes,

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:10%
and it hasn't been broken down,
it suggests that maybe there

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.110 align:middle line:10%
are substances in some
of these processed foods

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:10%
that we have no
ability to break down.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But then further to
that, the blue drink

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
had actually dyed
the noodles blue.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
dye in the blue drink

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:90%
was derived from petroleum.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have no ability inside
of us to break down petrol.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So a number of
artificial substances

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and colors and sweeteners
are created synthetically.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.955 align:middle line:84%
And some of the substances
that they're derived from--

00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I have concerns about
whether they even

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
belong in the human body.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>> There's basically tens of
teaspoons of sugar in those

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:10%
that is driving so much of
the disease we see in America.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Why are kids overweight?

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:59.627 align:middle line:84%
Why are kids
struggling in school?

00:25:59.627 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Why are kids having health
issues, academic issues,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:90%
depression issues?

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's really driven from
the food they're eating.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.812 align:middle line:10%
And these sports drinks seem
like they're a health food,

00:26:08.812 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:10%
but they're actually one of
the worst things on the market.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been hoodwinked
about sugar.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:10%
We've had companies
who rely on sugar,

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:10%
like the big soda
companies, paying scientists

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:10%
to say that saturated fat
was making us unhealthy,

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:10%
causing heart disease, causing
obesity, and not actual sugar.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And so our eyes have been off
the ball for many, many years,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:90%
having a different villain.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.396 align:middle line:84%
But really, the
villain has been sugar.

>> The biggest threat facing
us today is invisible.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It's food injustice.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a result of the food
policies from our government

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
that are promoting the
production and the growing

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of food commodities
that drive disease.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In our allowing of
food marketing to kids.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
In our having of subsidizations
of sugar in processed food,

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and food stamps
that buy $4 billion

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:90%
worth of soda year for the poor.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
There's so many examples of ways
in which our food policies are

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.672 align:middle line:90%
driving disease.

00:27:15.672 --> 00:27:17.755 align:middle line:84%
They're driving poverty,
they're driving violence,

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
they're driving destruction
of our environment,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're even driving
damage to our economy.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.562 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
actually, as a society,

00:27:24.562 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
step up and go,
hey, wait a minute,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.455 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to take anymore.

00:27:27.455 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at the ways
in which the food industry is

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.212 align:middle line:84%
driving behaviors,
and driving behaviors

00:27:32.212 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to the production of food,
and the marketing of food,

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and the food policies that
are promoting these things,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it can begin
to turn the tide

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and get people to
understand that we

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
need to create a movement
to stop the food injustice.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It's harming our
communities, our families,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and even our social
fabric and our economy.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Brian Poole on coverage.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:10%
And Brady lays it out perfectly.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at Tom Brady, his
age at being a quarterback,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and this effective-- we've
never seen it before.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:10%
And so for somebody
who is actually

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:10%
living what he's preaching,
I think it says a lot.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The fact that they can
sell that to kids, I mean,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:10%
that's poison for kids.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:10%
But they keep doing it.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.575 align:middle line:10%
That's just America, and that's
what we've been conditioned to.

00:28:16.575 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:10%
So you know we believe that
Frosted Flakes are actually

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:10%
food.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> When Tom Brady said that
Frosted Flakes wasn't fit

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:84%
for children, and that
Coca-Cola was poison,

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I screamed from the rooftops.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I was like, finally, an athlete
sticking up for children.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And we need more role
models and more athletes

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to take that plunge, and
to be that courageous.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I tell you,
it is important

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
for the overall
health of this world

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that we get the true message
about food out to our children.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>> This whole idea that sugar
is OK, and carbs are OK,

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and fat is bad came
out of the '60s.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't by accident.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a movement
by the sugar industry

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and the lobby to actually vilify
fat and to exonerate sugar.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.590 align:middle line:10%
And they hired two
scientists from Harvard--

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:10%
paid them the equivalent
$50,000 in today's dollars--

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:10%
to write a review of
the research at the time

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.602 align:middle line:10%
because sugar was being
implicated in heart disease.

00:29:15.602 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted to
discredit that theory.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.643 align:middle line:84%
And based on that article,
published in the "New England

00:29:19.643 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Journal" in 1967
science for hire,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
they were out actually
able to catalyze

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
this movement of
low fat, high carbs

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that's driven our
obesity epidemic.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the obesity rates

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:84%
after the dietary
guidelines came in 1980,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
it's a hockey stick up
in obesity and diabetes.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
There's been a
seven-fold increase

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in the rate of diabetes
since 1980 around the world.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
the plethora of sugar.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we have about
152 pounds of sugar

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
per person consumed
in America per year,

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and about 146 pounds of flour.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
That's about a pound a
day of sugar and flour

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:53.217 align:middle line:90%
for every man, woman, and child.

00:29:53.217 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are just
not adapted to that.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
really clear policies that

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.687 align:middle line:90%
change behavior.

00:30:01.687 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:10%
Michael Bloomberg tried to
address this in New York City

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.273 align:middle line:10%
with taxing large sodas.

00:30:05.273 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:10%
He tried to get a sugar tax.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.520 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't pass it through.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Philadelphia's
passed a sugar tax.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Berkeley passed a sugar tax.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:10%
Mexico has passed a sugar tax.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And we know that those
are effective in reducing

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:90%
obesity and preventing disease.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have
evidence that these work,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and that, at scale, they can
have an impact on choices.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Just like we tax smoking.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.287 align:middle line:84%

I think today's profound.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:90%
our heads with its enormity.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So let me use time as an
example to demonstrate

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:90%
the enormity of that.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So 1 million seconds
ago was 12 days ago.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
1 billion seconds
ago was 32 years ago.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But 1 trillion seconds
ago was 32,000 years ago.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have about 50 trillion
cells that make you up.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So the best way
to pick to that is

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion tiny little
circles, and they all

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:90%
want to talk to each other.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But the only way
they can communicate

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is when there are
nutrients present.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have grave concerns that
there are just too many people

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
not getting the
nutrients that are

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
essential for very basic
cell-to-cell communication.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially the
health of our cells.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The things that really pack
a wallop in restoring health all

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:16.530 align:middle line:84%
make evolutionary
or adaptive sense.

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.500 align:middle line:84%
What if we revert
back to those foods?

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:84%
What did humans eat for
the first 99.6% of our time

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.660 align:middle line:90%
on earth?

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:90%
We gathered plants.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Fruit, of course.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Digging the dirt with
our sticks and stones

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:84%
for underground
tubers and roots.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Berries, nuts, shellfish--
fish, of course--

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:90%
eggs, poultry.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The things that humans
instinctively regard as food.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.150 align:middle line:84%
If we can return to
a diet like that,

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
we return to the health
of primitive people.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a common fiction that
primitive people die young.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.857 align:middle line:84%
That can be true from
injury and infection.

00:32:52.857 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
But they don't die of diabetes,
heart disease, dementia,

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and cancer.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at our past,
we were hunter gatherers,

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.390 align:middle line:84%
or gatherer hunters, depending
on the ecosystem that

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors lived in.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We ate what the
environment provided.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near a
lake, we ate fish.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near the ocean,
we were probably fishermen.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the tropics,
we eat what was growing there.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the
far north, we hunted.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
But we ate seeds.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:90%
We eat insects.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:90%
We ate nuts.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:90%
We eat plants, mostly.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a very high fibrous diet
because the original plants

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:84%
were much more high in
fiber than plants are today.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And the animal products
we ate were mostly

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
insects and grubs
and things like that.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But if we were able to catch
or kill a larger animal,

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:90%
those were wild animals.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:90%
And they were very low in fat.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.287 align:middle line:84%
Today, though, animals
are living in feedlots.

00:33:47.287 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:90%
They're living in factory farms.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:90%
They are not allowed to move.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.938 align:middle line:84%
They don't develop
muscle tissue.

00:33:51.938 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They're very high in fat,
and it's mostly storage fats.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Highly saturated fats.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%
The animals are so miserable.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.240 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep these animals
alive under these conditions,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:84%
these conditions
are so unnatural,

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
they have to inject
them with antibiotics,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:90%
or feed them antibiotics.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes use hormones as
well, and other chemicals.

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Insecticides to kill the
flies that are around.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.190 align:middle line:84%
When people say, oh, but
our ancestors ate meat,

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
down to the butcher

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or to McDonald's and buy
that, they don't realize

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
how different metabolically,
nutritionally, energetically

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.137 align:middle line:84%
that meat that they're
buying is from the meat

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about our
ancestors having eaten.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what our ancestors
ate were wild animals.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
>> There's grass-fed, organic
beef, and there's grain-fed,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.060 align:middle line:90%
GMO, conventional beef.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.647 align:middle line:84%
There's good wheat,
and there's bad wheat.

00:34:46.647 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
there's a difference

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:90%
between the products.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:84%
And I if we're looking at an
ancient einkorn wheat that

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
sprouted, and then slow cooked
for a long period of time,

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.900 align:middle line:84%
like it was done
in the Bible, like

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:84%
it was done in Chinese medicine,
like it's done in the Middle

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:90%
East still today.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:03.485 align:middle line:84%
If it's properly
prepared, I believe

00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:90%
it could be easy to digest.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:84%
There are studies showing
that lacto-fermented,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
so fermented grains in gluten,
actually may not affect celiacs

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:90%
like other types of grains.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So I actually truly believe
that the biggest thing

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.368 align:middle line:84%
is that we're not preparing
our foods properly.

00:35:18.368 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What you want to eat,
though, is as many plants as--

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.327 align:middle line:84%
as many fruits and vegetables
and seeds and nuts as you can.

00:35:24.327 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people do well
with whole grains.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.565 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to be vegans
and eat no animal products.

00:35:28.565 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to eat
some animal products.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of variation
here on what's a healthy diet.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But if someone wants to
eat animal products as part

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of their diet, the most
ethical and the healthiest

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:90%
is wild fish.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Particularly fish that
is low mercury, that

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.920 align:middle line:90%
is high in omega-3 fatty acids.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Wild salmon, sardines,
herring, mackerel.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
These are fish that are
low in heavy metals,

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
low in contaminants, low
in pesticide residues,

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and are high in
the types of fats

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.455 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies need to thrive,
and our brains need to thrive.

00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a marvelous thing
that the food choices that

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
are healthiest
for us personally,

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:84%
that give us the most
strength, the most

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:84%
vitality, the strongest
immune systems, and therefore

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the least susceptibility
to pathogens

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and infectious diseases.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.230 align:middle line:84%
The strongest respiratory
system, and so we

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
can breathe deeply
with life, and enjoy

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:90%
the beauty of simply breathing.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The same food choices that
are so much healthier for us

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
are also kinder to
the animals and don't

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.315 align:middle line:84%
cause the sync environmental
distress and damage.

00:36:34.315 --> 00:36:37.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people don't understand
that what you put at the end

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of your fork is more powerful
than any drug you'll find

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:90%
in a pill bottle.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
That food is not
just like medicine.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It is medicine.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Food is a better
drug than most drugs.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.948 align:middle line:84%
It works faster,
better, and is cheaper

00:36:50.948 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:84%
than any drug on the market,
and it has no side effects

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.449 align:middle line:90%

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, because of incredible
advances in the world,

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:90%
we are living a lot longer.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Our life expectancy has
almost doubled since 1900.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:84%
However, a big
question to ponder

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:84%
is are we living too
short and dying too long.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So we still want to be
able to bend over and do up

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.480 align:middle line:84%
her own shoelaces in the
second half of our life.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't want your tummy to
have gotten so big that you can

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:84%
no longer reach your
feet, or your spine

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to have become so
inflexible that you

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.385 align:middle line:90%
can no longer get to your toes.

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:37.260 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to people
who can no longer put

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:84%
on their own shoes, they regret
the choices in the first half

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.270 align:middle line:90%
of their life very much.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So the choices we
make today don't just

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
impact how we feel
and function today.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
They're going to impact what
that entire future looks like.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the power to change
that is in your hands,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and in your hands only.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.473 align:middle line:90%
No one else can do it for you.

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you have
to believe that you're

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:90%
worth taken care of.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the
industry today,

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.570 align:middle line:90%
we're in a really unique place.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
We have more toxic,
processed food

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:84%
than ever in the
history of the world.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we
actually have more access

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.883 align:middle line:84%
to the world's super
foods than ever before.

00:38:13.883 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So essentially, what I
recommend to people is eat

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.425 align:middle line:84%
foods that don't have
nutrition fact labels,

00:38:18.425 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that don't have
ingredient lists,

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and that don't have a barcode,
because they're just food.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.640 align:middle line:84%
An avocado doesn't have
an ingredient list.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:10%
An almond doesn't have
a nutrition facts label.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And eggs don't have a barcode.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:90%
They're just food.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's really not complicated.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I do programs in large churches,
and I make it very simple.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I say, leave the
food that man made.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:10%
Eat the food that God made.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And any kindergarten
kid can understand that.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I've seen in my
clinical practice over nearly

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
20 years is that there are many
people who benefit enormously

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.090 align:middle line:84%
with their physical health,
with their happiness,

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.490 align:middle line:84%
with their performance,
with their strength,

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
just with how robust they feel
in life when they make a change

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to how they eat that actually
serves their own individual

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:90%
needs.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're on the
diet that's ideal for you,

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
eating becomes effortless.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of life.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Your cravings are stabilized.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Your body is full of energy.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Your reliance on outside
prescription drugs

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:90%
starts to diminish.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Your reliance on outside
therapy start to diminish,

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and you realize you can
get just about everything

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:90%
you need from food.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And until you get to that
point, I say keep experimenting.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You can find incredible
health that you--

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:84%
even to this day, I'm astounded
at the conditions that

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:90%
reverse with this lifestyle.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And every day, it doesn't
cease to amaze me.

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
do with my day--

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I talk to people
who've done this.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And they even look different.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's an actual
transformation in appearance.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, it provides
this kind of anti-aging or youth

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.510 align:middle line:90%
preserving effect.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And typically they look
10, 20 years younger.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful effect.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course,
everybody's different.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:90%
But one thing is for sure.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.060 align:middle line:84%
The living foods, the organic
foods, non-processed foods

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:84%
are the best thing that you
can fuel your body with.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what
we're meant to eat.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.390 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're meant to
live, so that we can thrive

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and others can thrive.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.262 align:middle line:84%
So that we can thrive,
and we don't destroy

00:40:21.262 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%
the world in the process.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we want to
live with respect

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.683 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and others
because it feels so good.
