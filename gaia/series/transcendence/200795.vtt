>> My entire life just
came crashing down.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.225 align:middle line:84%
I had lost my home
due to foreclosure.

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:90%
I was six figures in debt.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:90%
My boyfriend was an alcoholic.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
That relationship broke up.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
serious blood clot close

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to my heart and lungs.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go into
emergency treatment for that.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
As everything was just crashing
down, I just fell to my knees.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know how I
was going to get through it.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:90%
I really hit rock bottom.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I was lying in my bed and
just crying, crying, crying,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
crying all by myself,
rolled up in a ball.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The story that I kept on telling
myself is, how did this happen?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
get out of this?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
I felt really helpless.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And for a really brief moment,
I wanted to end it all.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted the pain to stop.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
make that pain stop.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
allowed myself to do

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is I just allowed myself
to just cry it all out.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And after crying,
I got out of bed.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I walked around the
bed to the window.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking outside
the window when I said,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
this is happening.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I know for
sure, something big, something

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
huge something
way bigger than me

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
is going to come out of this.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not going through
all this stuff for nothing.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It was like a declaration.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.474 align:middle line:84%
It was an intention I
sent out to the universe.

00:02:35.474 --> 00:03:07.087 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to go through
challenges in life one way

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
or another.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
In the hero's journey, we
would call this the initiation.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The hero's journey is
this famous narrative that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.592 align:middle line:90%
really applies to all of us.

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And there are three main
parts of the hero's journey.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a separation, an
initiation, and a return.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about the hero's journey

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
is it's cyclical.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happens on macro cycles

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and it happens on micro cycles.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's not, at one point,
we've just reached it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and we're done and we finished.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we're
always moving through.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And so here are a
couple interesting parts

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
of the hero's journey that I
feel that we as individuals can

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
relate to being somewhere
on the journey at any given

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:90%
point in our lives.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
happens is we're

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
on a path, a path that maybe
someone else decided was

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
ours to take, parents,
society, school.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And we realized we're meant
to be on a different path.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.403 align:middle line:84%
And so when we first realized
we were meant to be on a path,

00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
this is what Joseph
Campbell would

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
call the CTA, the Call To
Action or the Call To Adventure.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
He would say, that
the phone is ringing.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
this part of the hero's journey

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.046 align:middle line:84%
is most people don't pick
up the phone right away.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.541 align:middle line:84%
This is where it actually
gets a little bit sad,

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.733 align:middle line:84%
because some people will wait an
entire lifetime not picking up

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.533 align:middle line:90%
their phone.

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:24.028 align:middle line:84%
They'll hear the phone ringing
but they won't pick it up.

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:26.523 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people that
are on their deathbed saying,

00:04:26.523 --> 00:04:28.898 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd had the courage to
live a life true to myself.

00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:31.014 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying is,
I wish I had the courage

00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:34.008 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the phone.

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:37.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Individuals,
they grow two ways.

00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:42.491 align:middle line:84%
They grow through pain, or
they grow through insight.

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:45.485 align:middle line:84%
Individuals either
get sick and tired,

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.481 align:middle line:84%
because their experience
is being determined

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:48.898 align:middle line:84%
by the environment
in which we are

00:04:48.898 --> 00:04:52.471 align:middle line:84%
in, the conversations,
by the social milieu,

00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:54.966 align:middle line:84%
by whatever's going
on in society.

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:56.463 align:middle line:90%
It's an imprint.

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.207 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
beginning, we learn how

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:00.954 align:middle line:90%
to survive with the imprint.

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:04.447 align:middle line:84%
And then we learn how to
adapt with the imprint.

00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:07.441 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point in our life,

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:12.431 align:middle line:84%
either through pain, suffering,
or through tremendous insight,

00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.622 align:middle line:90%
we learn to transform.

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
We learn to go
beyond the imprint.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
we all have to be

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
taught that there's
something about us,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
something gifted, something
intrinsic within you

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that no one else has
the way you have it.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people, when they're
going through something

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that's debilitating, they'll
ask a disempowering question.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They'll ask from a
victim state, why me?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Who's to blame?

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And the mind would
just go wrap it

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%
with those kind of questions.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't take you anywhere.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They take you on
a downward spiral,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
or you will end up
mining the database

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.358 align:middle line:84%
You'll just pull in all the
frequency of all the suffering

00:06:03.358 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:90%
that's happening on the planet.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We are
meaning-making machines.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we've
experienced in life

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what we
needed to experience.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.585 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've been through
has been divinely orchestrated

00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
in some way to bring us to
this present moment right now.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you are grateful
for this moment,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
you must, by
definition, be grateful

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.088 align:middle line:84%
for every single
moment that you've

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
been through that got
you to this moment,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and every single one
that unfolds beyond that.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the meaning is
something that we can

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:90%
place on events and experience.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.937 align:middle line:84%
So if we feel like
something negative happened

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
to us in our lives, we don't
have to see it as negative.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.687 align:middle line:84%
If we feel like we're going
through something challenging,

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
we get to actually apply this,
this meaning-making principle

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to what we're going
through right now.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Once I did that declaration,
it was like I sent the message

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
out to god, universe,
whatever you believe in.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And it got the wheels in motion.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And about a week later, I
was still in that house.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
We hadn't lost it yet.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:90%
We were about to lose it.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking up
the stairs of that house,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I got to the landing, and I
said, I really get it now.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going through all this
stuff because my mission in life

I found a meaning that
is bigger than me,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that was something
like it was that light

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.718 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the tunnel.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:90%
And it was really bright.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was there.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to find my
way outside that tunnel.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:50.115 align:middle line:90%

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I had this really awesome
job at this diamond mine.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I found my job quite stressful.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.137 align:middle line:84%
And I was away from the coast
for the first time in my life,

00:08:36.137 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:90%
so I started to run.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd do these really
big runs after work.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I was always great
at running at school.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I was always a good
cross-country runner.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't because I was fast.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I just don't stop.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a mental game.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
on a really long run,

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.912 align:middle line:84%
your body gives up
but your mind doesn't.

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And your mind has got
to be strong enough

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to say, no, you've just
got be able to kick on.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.453 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to
take the next step.

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I've always really
liked challenges.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'd sign up to
do an ultramarathon.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It was another challenge for me.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It was something to get to learn
a little bit more about myself

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
and what type of person I was.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
The start of the run, we
were in outback Australia.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And summer had just ended,
so it was really, really hot.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I heard this noise.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
the next checkpoint

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
was over the other
side of the highway.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.605 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought the noise was
the sound of road trains coming

00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:40.405 align:middle line:90%
down the highway.

00:09:40.405 --> 00:09:43.815 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
That kind of spurred me on.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.398 align:middle line:84%
And I got this real
rush of energy,

00:09:46.398 --> 00:09:48.513 align:middle line:84%
like, yep, almost a
checkpoint through.

00:09:48.513 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:90%
You've got this, girl.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:84%
As I ran through this gorge,
I noticed these other runners

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were all looking at
this big fire coming really

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:90%
quickly through the gorge.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was panicking.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I was ever
going to make it out alive.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:90%
So I'd actually started to cry.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.342 align:middle line:84%
What happened next, it
happened so quickly.

00:10:13.342 --> 00:10:14.925 align:middle line:84%
The fire got sucked
through the gorge.

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up being
burnt all over my body.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember thinking, this is it.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:90%
This is how I die.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I just thought about
how unfair it was,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and that I never see
anyone I loved ever again.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:84%
After the fire had passed, I was
still in a shock of disbelief,

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.490 align:middle line:90%
like what just happened?

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I was still standing,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.167 align:middle line:90%
and I was still alive.

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The next couple
of hours, I didn't

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
know how long it was, time had
dilated, it had constricted.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up getting
helicoptered out of that gorge

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
about four hours
later after the fire.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a volunteering
ambulance paramedic, who

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:90%
was there on site to help me.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And I recognized her.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
She didn't recognize me.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know who I was.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's me.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.112 align:middle line:90%
It's Turia.

00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say anything back.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed a tear started
to roll slowly down her face.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So even though I was in this
state that, yeah, I'm sweet.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to the
hospital and get patched up.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back at work on Monday.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I had this sense that maybe
something bad had happened.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.737 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.737 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got transferred
to the hospital.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:90%
I was put in an induced coma.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They performed
escharotomies on me.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
An escharotomy is
when they slashed you

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
leg down to your ankle

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
to relieve the pressure.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because after a burn,
you start to swell up.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
When you're burnt that they
needed to debride your skin.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And debriding just means
they need to remove

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:90%
all of the burnt skin.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it was almost
maybe two months

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
later until I really
realized what had happened.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't get a
real insight into it.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.332 align:middle line:84%
Because one morning this
guy came into my room,

00:12:11.332 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know who he was.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
good morning, Turia.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:90%
My name's Frank.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm your physiotherapist.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help you
learn how to stand again.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And he managed to get
me in bed and pull me

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:90%
in a sitting position.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was complete agony.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
It was the most pain I've ever
felt in my whole entire life.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled me
up onto my feet.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.197 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
sobbing, just sobbing

00:12:37.197 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and crying all over his
neck, into his gold chain.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that was
really the moment when

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I realized how big
this challenge was

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:90%
that I was facing.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't even
stand up by myself.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So the thought of being able to
walk again, run again, compete

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
again, go back to work, have
a family with my partner,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
those things just seemed
so far away and so,

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
so impossible for
me to be able to do.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The dark side of the soul is
a moment in which you lose all

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
sense of connection with the
presence of the higher order

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
What you formerly believed,
it's gone out the window.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Your old identity has
begun to evaporate.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The new identity
hasn't emerged yet.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So you're in that
proverbial no man's land.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And that can last for
a short period of time,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
or it can last for a
long period of time.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.095 align:middle line:84%
The dark night of
the soul, understand,

00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a dark
night of the soul

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
because someone died,
or you lost a job,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:90%
or you got a divorce.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
That's regular sadness.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the sadness
of loss, and sadness

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:84%
of somebody dying, the sadness
of a structure in your life.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of soul is
something different.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
You could have nothing
wrong in your life,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.826 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly,
there's a bereftness.

00:14:08.826 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
That generally means
that either through grace

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
or through spiritual practice,
your new identity is emerging.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
But it hasn't emerged yet.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're not who
you used to be.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:90%
So you don't know who you are.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.972 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
what you believe.

00:14:22.972 --> 00:14:27.883 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I realized really
early on in that day that I

00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:28.877 align:middle line:90%
couldn't think--

00:14:28.877 --> 00:14:31.362 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't spend all this
time and energy worrying

00:14:31.362 --> 00:14:35.215 align:middle line:84%
about what my future was going
to look like, because that

00:14:35.215 --> 00:14:36.132 align:middle line:90%
was just too far away.

00:14:36.132 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:90%
It seemed insurmountable.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.805 align:middle line:84%
The prognosis from
the medical team,

00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:42.296 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't super optimistic.

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:44.284 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know who I was.

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:46.769 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know about my past.

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:50.248 align:middle line:84%
They just had to prepare me as
best they could for my future.

00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:55.218 align:middle line:84%
So they said, you know, you
might not be able to run again.

00:14:55.218 --> 00:14:58.697 align:middle line:84%
You might not be
as active and be

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.015 align:middle line:84%
able to do all
those crazy things

00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:03.667 align:middle line:84%
you like doing, like surfing
and rock-climbing and running.

00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:09.134 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that
you'll probably drive again.

00:15:09.134 --> 00:15:10.443 align:middle line:90%
You'll probably get a job.

00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably go back to work,
and you might even get married.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.589 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I just
thought that was just--

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:19.074 align:middle line:84%
I was so infuriated,
because I just thought,

00:15:19.074 --> 00:15:20.101 align:middle line:90%
you don't know who I am.

00:15:20.101 --> 00:15:21.559 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
I'm capable of.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.535 align:middle line:90%
I found that so infuriating.

00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:28.383 align:middle line:84%
It was that because
I'd had an accident--

00:15:28.383 --> 00:15:30.008 align:middle line:84%
I'd always been a
really high achiever.

00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:31.591 align:middle line:84%
I'd always done
really awesome things.

00:15:31.591 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But because I'd had an accident,
suddenly the bar for me

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:90%
was just placed right down here.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't like that.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the dark night, if
you can ask a question such

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
as, what quality do I need
to give birth to have peace

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of mind if this were
to last forever?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You start to work with
something like that.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And why is it important?

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Generally, when an individual
is in a dark night,

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:84%
they go through
wishful thinking.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't here.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't who I was.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd done
something differently.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.893 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd made
different decisions.

00:16:14.893 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
wishful thinking.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
None of those things
can ever happen

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
because you are who you
are, you are where you are,

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and this is what's happening.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So to the degree that
you can pull yourself out

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
of wishful thinking and ask
a different kind of question,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
when the dark night
is over, you've

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
found that you are a little bit
higher in your transformation

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't waste the
time asking futile questions,

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I would wish
upon anyone, the dark night.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
However, every mystic,
in hindsight, loves it.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
the moment, that you

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
were in that crucial
bowl of darkness,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:90%
that crucible of transformation.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And what you gain from it
is that you could actually

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
see the light in the darkness.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
The darkness shines
like the light.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, when
you come out of it,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:90%
you're really different.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
You're more of yourself.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The mystic chord of
memory has been struck.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're remembering
who you are.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
a change of circumstance.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's an expanded awareness
of the ineffable presence

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:90%
that we all are.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And in a way, I was able
to use that as motivation.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But I remember when I got told
that, I thought, you know what?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.697 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you.

00:17:40.697 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do an
Ironman one day.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I've always had really
amazing people around me.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember telling Michael,
my partner, and my mom,

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:84%
well, I was like, I'm
going to do an Ironman.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.915 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say to
me, that's silly.

00:17:55.915 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to listen to
what the doctor said,

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's unrealistic for you.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
They just said,
oh, awesome idea.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's get you out.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get you training.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's go get you working
for this Ironman.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.182 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we do pick up the
phone and we answer that CTA,

00:18:13.182 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that Call To Action
or Call To Adventure,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell would say,
we crossed the threshold.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And we've officially
made the separation.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And we moved from the first
part into the second part,

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.972 align:middle line:90%
which is now the initiation.

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're
going through the fire.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.058 align:middle line:90%
We start to meet allies.

00:18:27.058 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We start to connect
with other people

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
who share our values,
the people who

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
stand for the same kind
of things we stand for,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
the people who believe in
us and that we believe in.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The people that
are inspiring us.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The people that we want
along this journey,

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that we want on
his ride with us.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
start to fight our dragons.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And dragons can
be family members

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.317 align:middle line:90%
that don't believe in us.

00:18:49.317 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
They can be friends that
we've had for a long time

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that we think we need to
stay friends with just

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%
because that's been so long.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be our own
personal beliefs

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that we've had about ourselves
for a long time, to include,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I am not enough,
here I go again,

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:90%
who am I to be doing this.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
All of the self-doubt that
creeps in our minds, those

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:90%
are the dragons.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's external
and internal dragons

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that we fight going
through the fire.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:90%
We all have to experience that.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> My partner Michael, he would
go out and buy me all of these

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:90%
sports clothes.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
These really inspiring slogans,
it was a little bit corny.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:90%
But things like "never give up."

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be in this
little hospital

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
mask with this full
body compression suit

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
with these inspiring
slogans on the ceilings.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%
It sounds really corny.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
I appreciated it

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
having these people
who so believed in me,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
who so wanted me to get better.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful of them
to show up for me every day

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:90%
consistently.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And be there, even if
I was in a bad mood,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
even if I didn't
feel strong that day,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
even if I felt really
overwhelmed by what

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I was doing.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They were there with
me every single day.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you start
walking down this path,

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:90%
people will talk about you.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And you're afraid.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.188 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid I'm going to fail.

00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:08.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid it's
not going to work.

00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
laugh at me if I fail.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you do fail, which is
the learning, people will talk.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
If you succeed, they're
going to talk about you.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
They're going to talk
about you either way

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
because mediocrity
attacks excellence.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that you're going to
be talked about either way,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
you don't live your life
with what other people are

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:90%
thinking as your consideration.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
That's where much
anxiety comes from.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
People are taking too much
into consideration what

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.730 align:middle line:90%
others are thinking about them.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
others are more concerned

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
thinking about them.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.802 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is living
in this false narrative

00:20:46.802 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that people are thinking about
what they're thinking about.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the first
ways that you grow

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:90%
is that you let the "they" go.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And you become aware that
there's something within you,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
the great "I am," the singular
manifestation of a cosmic good

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:90%
that's within you.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:90%
That becomes what you listen to.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, with
practice, meditation,

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
like visioning, et cetera, that
becomes the predominant voice

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:90%
you hear.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
You're living your
passion of the gift that

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:90%
wants to come forward.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> When times are tough--

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
you read stories of people who
went through the Holocaust,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
or survivors from these
really horrific incidents.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And you think to yourself,
how did they do that?

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They just did because humans
are-- we're inherently,

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:90%
we're intrinsically resilient.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
But we never get tested.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Think about how
safe our lives are.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We get up, we go to
work, we have a shower,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.022 align:middle line:90%
we have food when we come home.

00:21:46.022 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't really get any of
these challenges in our lives.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And so when something
really challenging

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
does happen to us,
or maybe something

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that's not really that
challenging at all,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
we fall apart because
we've had no practice.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We've never had to flex
our resilience muscle.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Having gone through all
of my life beforehand,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:84%
being a woman in a
male-dominated industry,

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
going to classes
at university where

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:84%
you get told by your male
peers that you don't belong

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
in that class because you're
a woman, all of that stuff

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
made me more resilient.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And then my fire, my
fire experience, I guess,

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:90%
just cemented that for me.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I
would literally just

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:90%
take each day as it came.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%

I can't believe
this is happening.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:90%
This isn't fair.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And all that resentment and
anger around your situation,

you need to be passionate about.

that as an individual

and follow that
as your blueprint.

crazy to you,

want to change in
some way, or fix,

from visualization.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is
a good practice.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's an entry level practice
of seeing what you want,

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:84%
feeling it, declaring
it, articulating,

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
it coming into a resonance
with it until it manifests.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, people
are visualizing things

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that society told them they
should want to be happy.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Then when they get
it, they're not happy.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:90%
So visioning is different.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You're able to ask,
what is the vision?

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And you sit until you're
able to feel it, or hear

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:90%
it, or articulate it.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You ask, what is it
that I need to become

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to manifest this vision
that's growing edge?

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to
grow in my life?

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
What do I already have that can
be in service to the vision?

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to let go
of, that no longer serves

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:90%
my moving forward?

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.523 align:middle line:90%
Tap into a sense of willingness.

An avocado seed can't become
a daffodil, a magnolia.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
What's intrinsic to the avocado
seed is an avocado tree.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is something within
us that's intrinsic within us.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And we ask until we begin
to see what is my gift?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:90%
What is my passion?

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.530 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

That meaning is
really important.

And we can choose that
at any given time.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:84%
We can choose a
different meaning.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to find out
whether it's serving you or not

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:90%
is, how do you feel?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Does it make you feel
expanded or contracted?

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, being
able to help around this,

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%

it to be able to do that.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:90%

And I think if you

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
because of doing
all that, you are

00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
able to share your passions and
your purpose with other people.

get an education here,

And what happens
after you're awake?

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:90%
You serve more.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a continual
being of service,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.920 align:middle line:84%
awakening, being of
service, and awakening.

trying to appease our
acquisitive appetite--

I want more of this.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:90%

How can I serve more?

Then into that frequency, then
the other things are given.

can I be of service?

but I don't know my purpose.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we're
getting really indoctrinated,

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and to the point
where it's starting

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.780 align:middle line:84%

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough because
it's not your purpose.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:84%

like a tragic myth.

But if they don't, don't worry.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your purpose is
to make beautiful music,

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to make beautiful art,
to write beautiful poems.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But maybe at this moment,
people aren't buying them.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
it's not your purpose.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But what it may mean
is, you better get

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
a job as a waiter, or a
waitress, or a gas station

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:84%

it is so that you've

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:90%
got food on the table.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And don't feel badly.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't feel like somehow
that's beneath your purpose.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've
got a job that's

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
putting food on the
table and giving you

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:84%
the free time that you
need to create the music,

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to create the art
that is your purpose,

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.684 align:middle line:84%
so that you can give it away,
nothing wrong with that.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> When we can find our
calling, if it's our career,

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.670 align:middle line:90%
that's a beautiful thing.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, then our career
can support the calling.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Without an answering of the
calling, our soul is bereft.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It's sad, it's morose.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think our path
is to find our calling,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and to answer it.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the job you have
or the career you have

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:06.450 align:middle line:90%
is your calling.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Many times it's not.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Many times, your career, your
job supports your calling.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so then you
have a nice paradox

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of the job or the career
supporting the calling.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that either.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But we're indoctrinating
people to believe, oh,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:84%
being that waitress is
beneath you because, see,

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
your purpose is to be the
artist or the musician.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And if it's really your
purpose, it'll pay.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I can remember a gentleman
that was very pressured

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:90%
into becoming a doctor.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:84%
His father was a doctor, his
grandfather was a doctor.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just assumed
he would go into medicine.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And he did until he
suffered from cancer.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
healing the cancer,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
he fell back in love with
his passion, which was music.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:90%
He was a violinist.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And when he shifted
over to his love

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
he not only healed his
cancer but he found

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.270 align:middle line:90%
his calling, which was music.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
He was able to transcend
the parental fantasy.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it didn't
come without struggle

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.940 align:middle line:90%
of the soul, pain of the body.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:90%
But he ultimately did.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really important
because the new age media

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:31.020 align:middle line:84%
paints purpose, Dharma, as
though somehow you're going

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to find yourself on the cover of
a magazine when you figure out

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
what your purpose is and you
actually live it and fulfill

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:39.930 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to
be the most famous that,

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:46.590 align:middle line:84%
the best this, the richest
that, the newest this.

Maybe some people, maybe
that's some people's Dharma.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's not, not most people's.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And to really stay
rooted in what's

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:06.230 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
the core of who I am,

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and to move forward with that.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we know who we are
we will know what to do.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Finding your purpose
comes down to two things.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The first one is, dropping
from the head into the heart.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do
that is through meditation

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and mindfulness.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And actually, taking the time
to be quiet and to listen.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You establish your
intention to wake up,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to expand your awareness
to who and what you are.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the moment
of meditation is

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:84%
when you have that moment
of connectedness to life,

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and you learn how to pay
undistractable attention to it.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
all manner of debris,

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:84%
thought forms, whatever it may
be flowing through your mind--

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but you're learning to have
dominion over your attention

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:84%
so that as the
insight is occurring,

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.060 align:middle line:84%
you're able to be
aware of it and have

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:84%
a level of
stabilization around it.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:90%
You meditate on your existence.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:90%
The Ws.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Why am I?

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:90%
When am I?

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.995 align:middle line:84%
Until you start to be
taught, not just a belief,

00:45:16.995 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:84%
but you start to
have an insight.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.305 align:middle line:90%
So that's existential.

00:45:20.305 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual meditation
is when you're

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:90%
meditating simply to wake up.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.965 align:middle line:84%
You're establishing your
intention to wake up,

00:45:28.965 --> 00:45:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to have a greater
realization of your oneness

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.980 align:middle line:84%
with life, whether you call
life god, or the presence,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.070 align:middle line:90%
of love, or intelligence.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the technique
is, it's fundamental.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.030 align:middle line:90%
It's fundamental.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then affirmative prayer
is not begging or beseeching.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You're actually praying to
have a realization of what

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:90%
you're praying for.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You already have it, you see.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We enter into a
state of gratitude.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.636 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to recognize
the presence that's everywhere.

00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:10.200 align:middle line:84%
We begin to feel our
unity with this presence.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we proclaim

And as they've done these
longitudinal studies

00:50:13.207 --> 00:50:15.760 align:middle line:84%
on astronauts and figuring
out what exactly shifted,

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:84%
they came up with this term
called the overview effect.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:90%
What it boils down to is this.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.570 align:middle line:84%
When you're in space
looking down on the Earth,

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.190 align:middle line:84%
you see the Earth as a
living, breathing organism.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And we, as humans, as
part of this organism,

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.070 align:middle line:90%
are like the cells in our body.

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.920 align:middle line:84%
We are a small part of
a much bigger puzzle.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.532 align:middle line:84%
And yet, just like we
need every single cell

00:50:38.532 --> 00:50:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to come together to make tissue,
and tissue to make organs,

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and organs to make up the
body, every single human being,

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:84%
when they're alive
and on purpose,

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
gets to be the cell that is
functioning at its highest

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.760 align:middle line:84%
capacity in order to
make this organism, which

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.780 align:middle line:90%
is planet Earth.

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:54.700 align:middle line:84%

We're just a part of it.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.730 align:middle line:84%

opportunity for us

How do we solve them?

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But research shows that
in these blissful states,

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.690 align:middle line:84%
in these ecstatic states, they
don't just make us feel better

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and they don't just
extend to meditation.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.870 align:middle line:84%
They extend to the
world around us.

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.940 align:middle line:84%
A 10-year study of high
performing executives

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:54.870 align:middle line:84%
found that in flow states,
like meditation producers,

00:51:54.870 --> 00:52:00.540 align:middle line:84%
our productivity
increases by 500%.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.750 align:middle line:84%
A study by the defense
research agency DARPA

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:84%

our problem solving
ability increases by 490%.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Our creativity explodes.

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, as we're having
many, many people

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.680 align:middle line:84%
entering these
blissful states, we

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.950 align:middle line:84%
have increased leverage
over those global problems.

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:23.850 align:middle line:90%
How many more people?

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, around 1980, about 1%
of the population in most

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.080 align:middle line:90%
countries were meditators.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.495 align:middle line:84%
And this 1% is very consistent
throughout the world

00:52:33.495 --> 00:52:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and throughout history.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But in 2005, about 4% of
Americans were meditating.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The latest research shows
it's about 15% of people.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.360 align:middle line:84%

their productivity and problem

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.470 align:middle line:90%

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Now we have all these brains.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're not only
individual brains,

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.930 align:middle line:84%
they're coherent
with each other.

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:05.310 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in coherence, in mental
coherence and heart coherence,

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in coherence
with myself,

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm in coherence with everyone
on the planet who's coherent.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have all of these
brains in these states.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And the number of people doing
this increasing exponentially,

problem solving ability

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:84%

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:31.380 align:middle line:84%
new kind of existence, where
we are living from our hearts,

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.960 align:middle line:84%
where each person is able to
manifest into the world all

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
of their gifts and all
of that perfection,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that blueprint that
is within their heart.

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's
where we're going.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I know that's where
we're going to get.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.430 align:middle line:90%
We are going to get there.

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's the future

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I am an absolute
optimist for the future.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll solve
all of these problems.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And we'll rise to unprecedented
heights of flourishing.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the process is
geometric in its progression.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.447 align:middle line:84%
We get more, and more,
and more into the state.

00:54:00.447 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:84%
We produce more and
more of these chemicals.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We change our brains
more and more.

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We accelerate the
process of happiness.

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And we then start to change
the world in ways that

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.260 align:middle line:90%
make us flourish even more.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Over the next 10,
20, 50 years, we'll

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.890 align:middle line:84%
be solving those problems with
the increased capacity we have.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So as you elevate
yourself above zero

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to that space of being in
bliss brain, being happy,

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.570 align:middle line:84%
feeling good, but also
changing your brain

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and then having all of those
human capacities come online,

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.350 align:middle line:84%
they are not just there
for you in meditation.

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:84%
They are there for the world
and the world outside of you.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> If we as individuals can
come into deep harmony within

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:50.670 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, the power and the
magnificence that we can create

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:54.450 align:middle line:84%
as a global culture
is phenomenal.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Together as a humanity,
we can transform.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
we do as a humanity

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:84%
will transform as
a result of it.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.088 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.088 --> 00:55:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the world
we're heading to.

00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:05.740 align:middle line:84%
A world of peace,
a world of love,

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:84%
a world where
compassion is the norm.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I dream of a day when my
grandchildren come to me

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:16.355 align:middle line:84%
and say, granddaddy, I have a
school project I'm working on.

00:55:16.355 --> 00:55:18.283 align:middle line:90%
It's on this thing called PTSD.

00:55:18.283 --> 00:55:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I know, granddaddy,
you used to be

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:90%
involved in research into this.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You used to work with
veterans and refugees.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know anyone
with this weird disease.

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:27.440 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Now your grandparents talk
about diphtheria and polio.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even know what
those diseases even are.

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I want a world where
our children don't

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.690 align:middle line:84%
know what depression,
or anxiety, or PTSD is.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's unknown there.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And we really have
it in our grasp.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Science shows we
have it in our graph

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to produce that kind of a world.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.330 align:middle line:90%
We have those tools right now.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving inextricably
toward deploying them

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to solving all these
wicked human problems.

00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:55.357 align:middle line:90%
So the world is changing.

00:55:55.357 --> 00:55:56.440 align:middle line:90%
We're in the middle of it.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.240 align:middle line:90%
We are the people.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It is such an exciting
moment to be alive

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.350 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we're
headed in the aggregate,

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:06.130 align:middle line:90%
in the global, in the long term.

00:56:06.130 --> 00:59:04.000 align:middle line:90%
