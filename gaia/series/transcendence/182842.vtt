>> My dad and my uncle had
founded Baskin-Robbins 31

Flavors, which became,
in my childhood,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
the world's largest
ice cream company.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.188 align:middle line:84%
It was a
multibillion-dollar company.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I loved eating ice cream.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:90%
What kid doesn't?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:90%
And we had unlimited amounts.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:84%
We had an ice cream cone-shaped
swimming pool in our backyard.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I swam in it.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I had ice cream for
breakfast sometimes.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't well.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I was ill.

I was frail.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:10%
I actually had polio when I was
six, and I was in a wheelchair.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:10%
The doctor said I would be in a
wheelchair the rest of my life.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:10%


00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:10%
But then I started to regain
some feeling in my legs,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:10%
and some movement-- more on
the right leg than the left--

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:10%
and I could kind of get around.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
When I was 21, my left leg was
3 inches shorter than the right,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't put
any weight on it.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It was very gimpy.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said, well, your
growing years are over now.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.062 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to live with this.

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:08.562 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
thinking when I heard

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:10%
that, I don't think you know
as much as you think you know.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm not accepting
that prognosis.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm an only son, so my dad
had groomed me to succeed him.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:90%
That was his plan.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was used to
getting what he wanted.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:90%
He was a doer.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
He knew how to manifest stuff.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
He built this empire--

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
this ice cream empire.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:90%
He worked 80 hours a week.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't really have
a relationship with him

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
much, other than
through the business.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But I started working
at Baskin-Robbins

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:90%
when I was five years old.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I did then
was sweep the floor,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:90%
empty the waste baskets.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted me to learn the
business from the inside out.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So as I got older, he would
give me age-appropriate jobs.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the factory where
ice cream was manufactured.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I worked in franchising,
where the stores were

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
located and sold.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I worked in advertising
and marketing.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I ran all the departments
of the business.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
relationship to my dad,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
was we would drive together to
the office, then we drive home.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the business.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.418 align:middle line:84%
I hardly knew him
other than that,

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
his life was all about.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he wanted with me.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:10%
He didn't have much interest
in anything about my feelings

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:10%
or thoughts other than, what did
I think about the next flavor?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.313 align:middle line:90%
And I actually liked it.

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
He was really good
at what he did.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
He was really focused.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
His ability to
concentrate was amazing.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Kind of yogic, in a
way, although not--

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the values
of caring for others.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Although he wanted
to make people happy,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and he thought ice cream did.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:90%
I was a product of the '60s.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to work
with Dr. Martin Luther King.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:10%
I marched with him.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I went to Alabama and
Mississippi to be with him

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.295 align:middle line:84%
and participate in the
civil rights movement.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I was a kid from the north.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I was a white kid.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that was
history happening.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was an
opportunity to be

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
part of something--
to witness something

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that was of immense
significance.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
To me, the racism in our
society was abhorrent.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.132 align:middle line:84%
My dad thought, you're
trying to rock the boat.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
culture in the South.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't go down there.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You should leave them alone.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
They don't want you.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the war in Vietnam,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was a
ridiculously stupid idea--

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:90%
the war-- and cruel.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And I opposed the war.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I protested it.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:90%
My dad was in favor of it.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
So we had our differences.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.812 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, well,
you could take stores

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
world, and you could

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%
build the company even bigger.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was thinking, yeah?

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Why would I-- yes, I could.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.975 align:middle line:84%
You've built something
powerful, big, strong.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.122 align:middle line:90%
I could continue that.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But my uncle-- his
business partner,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
my dad's brother-in-law--
died of a heart attack

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 54.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a very big guy.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:90%
He ate a lot of ice cream.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And when he died,
I asked my dad,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
do you think there could be a
connection between the amount

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
of ice cream that Burt Baskin
ate and his fatal heart attack?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And my dad said, no.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
His ticker just got tired
and stopped working.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And then he looked at
me in a certain way.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And if I could
translate that look,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
it said, don't ever
mention that again.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And I started to think
that my uncle's death

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and some other things
that I saw, I was starting

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to think, I don't think I want
to do what my dad has planned

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
for me, even though I was
enjoying working with him,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.653 align:middle line:84%
and the company was a
extravagant success,

00:04:55.653 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and there was really unlimited
amounts of ice cream,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and almost unlimited amounts
of money, actually, coming in.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:90%
But I made a decision then.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was a decision that
defined my life ever since,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.485 align:middle line:84%
which was to walk away
from Baskin-Robbins

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to run
the company with my dad,

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:90%
and eventually, to inherit it.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I also chose,
out of integrity,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
to walk away from the money.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So I told my dad,
because I'm not

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
going to do what
you want me to do,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
what you've planned
for me to do,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's honorable and
respectful to you and to me

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
to not have any access
to your money, which

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:90%
has come from the company.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:90%
My dad thought I was crazy.

arguably, you could
say-- too late

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to discover that what
they've set out to achieve

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really a part
of who they are.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Often, people are saying to
me, how do I find my passion?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%
How do I find my purpose?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Number one is we should reframe
the word "find" and say,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.053 align:middle line:90%
how do we uncover it?

00:06:21.053 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Because finding
almost illustrates

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.845 align:middle line:84%
that it's under the bed, or
it's over behind the counter,

00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:90%
or it's in a book somewhere.

And ultimately, it's
within ourselves.

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
that, and you say, OK,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
what if I understand who I am,

understand self-sabotage,

passed before us have been

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
generous enough
to give us wisdom.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:90%
it was this.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had lived a life true
to myself, and not the life

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
that others had expected of me.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like when it comes
to understanding that each of us

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
have a gift that we were put
on this Earth for a reason,

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that there never will
be another one of us,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
understanding that now is the
time to take whatever it is

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that are our passions, and
our quirks, and our visions,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and bring them out
into the world,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
because we will
never be here again.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at that
as something exciting,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
limited amount of time,

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%

joy, express our love, to make

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
a difference, to contribute
to others, all of a sudden,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:84%
it becomes less something
to fear and more

is first and foremost

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:90%
a desire for comfort and ease.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:90%

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:84%
That process is going
to bring hardship.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:90%
It's going to bring frustration.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.853 align:middle line:90%
It's going to bring the unknown.

00:09:00.853 --> 00:09:02.728 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring
people making fun of you.

00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%

so scared of that, honor it.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Go, that's part of the process.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.267 align:middle line:84%
a lot of greatness, who
could go to this next level,

00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
they don't, because they're
not listening to that inside

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:90%

That inside thing that
says, we got to change this.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
That inside thing that is scary
sometimes, because it says,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
we got to blow all this up
because it's wrong for us.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.365 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it feels
irresponsible to listen

00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to that voice, and very
responsible to listen

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the person says,
now, be careful.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you're always
listening to that person

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.020 align:middle line:84%
or that side of you, then what
ends up winning is certainty.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Because past the comfort
zone is a lot of unknown,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.835 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of fear.

00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's only three
psychological mechanisms

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:90%
that create fear.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Number one is called loss pain.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.713 align:middle line:84%
Loss pain means, if
I do that, then I'm

00:10:24.713 --> 00:10:27.235 align:middle line:84%
going to lose something
I like over here.

00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If I go to change my diet,
then I lose the foods I love.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:84%
If I quit this job, then I lose
those co-workers I do like.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I lose my health insurance.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So people don't
change because they're

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.465 align:middle line:84%
scared they're going
to lose something.

00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Lose something tangible,
lose something intangible.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they feel like,
I'm going to lose respect.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.283 align:middle line:84%
And loss pain terrorizes
people, so they stay stuck.

00:10:48.283 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to lose
the things I'm already

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.655 align:middle line:90%
certain about in life.

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:84%
A second thing that people
fear is called hardship pain.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The process of
changing will bring

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
doubt, uncertainty, discomfort.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It will bring
hardship to me, where

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stretch, and
learn, and retool new things.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
People don't quit the
job because they go, ugh,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to create a resume.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to go interview.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to put
myself out there again.

People don't go
dating because they

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:90%
say those same things today.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%

change because they say,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, if I want to
lose weight, I'm

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
going to have to learn
to cook new things.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to change my
schedule to go to the gym now.

sore all the time.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's process pain.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one
is called outcome pain.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Outcome pain is, I'm scared that
if I go through all of that, I

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
put myself out there, I
try, I endure the hardship,

greener on the other side.

I did all the things

to be disappointed.

of disappointment.

warfare in their mind

might not turn out well.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:10%
And then what happens?

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:10%
Well, then I lose something.

What happens if
I lose something?

Then it becomes hard.

fear, and move fear away,

I eventually wrote "Diet
for a New America,"

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and I sent it to my dad.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
By that time, we weren't
talking too much.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of distance.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I had made my decision, my
choice, and he was hurt.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I tried to do it with
as much respect for him

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
as I possibly could,
but in essence, I

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:90%
was rejecting his life work.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was a sad thing,
and he was angry about it.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.787 align:middle line:90%
So we didn't talk too much.

00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But I thought he might want to
know that I'd published a book,

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and so I sent him a copy.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.960 align:middle line:90%
He didn't open it.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
My dad at that time
had become very ill.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.747 align:middle line:90%
He had diabetes.

00:14:28.747 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:90%
He had very high blood pressure.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:90%
He had heart disease.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
He was overweight.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
His diabetes was so
severe that the prognosis

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
was a possible amputation
of a foot, or even

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:90%
a leg, and blindness.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And his blood pressure
was so out of control,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
he had to take 10 what he
called horse pills every day.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they were, but he'd

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
been told he'd have to take
them for the rest of his life.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:84%
My dad went to his cardiologist,
and the cardiologist

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
leveled with him, and
said, Mr. Robbins,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
you're a very sick
man right now.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And the best we
can do for you is

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
try to juggle your
medications, try

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.058 align:middle line:84%
to control some of
the side effects

00:15:08.058 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're experiencing,
and that are distressing you,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and try to make your few
remaining years a little more

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
comfortable.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was scared.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
on the other hand,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
if you were willing to
change your lifestyle

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and what you eat, there might be
a different prognosis for you.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, well,
what do you mean?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And the physician
handed him a copy

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
of "Diet for a New
America," my book,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that the John
Robbins who'd written it

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:84%
was the son of his patient, Irv
Robbins, the founder and owner

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:90%
of Baskin-Robbins.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And my dad of course
knew, because I'd

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
sent him already a copy of the
book, but he didn't tell him.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But he went home, and
now, because the book

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
had been blessed by the high
priest of Western medicine,

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:90%
he began to read it.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he read the
copy the doctor gave him,

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.328 align:middle line:84%
not the copy I'd sent
him that was autographed.

00:16:04.328 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But he read it, and he
started to make changes.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Small ones at first.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:90%
But he got results.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And then he made more changes,
more results, more changes,

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:90%
more results.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward two
years, he's off all

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:90%
the medications he'd been on.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
His diabetes has gone
into complete remission.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need insulin anymore.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even need
diabetic pills anymore.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
His circulation to his
legs and feet is restored,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and to his eyes is restored.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
He's lost the weight
that he needed to lose.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
His golf game has
improved by eight strokes,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.287 align:middle line:90%
and he's thrilled.

00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor's thrilled.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And he calls me up and
says, Johnny, you're

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
not going to believe
what's happened.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:90%
What's happened?

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's unbelievable.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I said, all right.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:90%
What's unbelievable?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
It's really not possible,
but it's happened.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:90%
What, Dad?

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
you were right.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And-- honestly, that my
dad, who had achieved

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenal
business success,

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
could say to this son that
rejected his life work that you

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.980 align:middle line:84%
might have been
right, about anything,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I respect that enormously,
because that's of the heart.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
That takes something.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:90%
This is a man who had it all.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
He was a billionaire.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he could say to his
son who walked away from it all

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that you might have been right.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
To me, I will always
live with that joy.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, we
had a rapprochement.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
We began to talk
about a lot of things.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a
reconciliation between us,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
got completely renewed.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
The connection was there.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:90%
The love was there.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
The respect was there, both
ways, reciprocal, moving.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And we were connected again.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And he lived another
20 years, most of them

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
very healthy ones, when
the prognosis had been he

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
was on his deathbed.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I disappointed him so
much by making a choice

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that I felt was for integrity,
but from his point of view,

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
it was a slap in the face.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that, in the end,
I was able to give him

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
something perhaps more
valuable than had I

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
done the obvious thing.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
written other books,

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and had sold millions of
copies of them, and had many,

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
many people write me and tell
me that their lives had been

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:84%
changed in similar
ways to my dad's.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is so
much more rewarding

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and fulfilling for me.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I think we really need
to redefine success

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:84%
in a way that includes our
hearts, and includes our love,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and includes our compassion,
and includes our caring for one

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we know when
we're a success when

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
our hearts are strong, and
we live with them in a way.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so our life
reflects our hearts.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:84%
We make choices that
express our love, or caring.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes the
defining aspect of who we are.

>> I grew up in New Jersey
in a very blue-collar family.

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:45.613 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.613 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
My parents got
divorced, and there

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
were all these issues that
happened throughout growing up.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.463 align:middle line:84%
I was actually the first in
my family to go to college.

00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I studied business,
and when I graduated

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
from college, the only
job that really interested

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
me was something
that was active,

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
so I got myself a job on the
floor of the New York Stock

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Exchange.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're standing all
day long, and people

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are screaming and yelling, and
it's a very exciting, energetic

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:90%
place to work.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was making
millions of dollars,

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
but while they were
rich financially,

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
they were spiritually bankrupt.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing this
small voice inside that said,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
this isn't what
you're supposed to do.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not where
you're supposed to be.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to silence that
voice because I had debt.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Feeling like I should
be doing something else,

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what that was was

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.460 align:middle line:84%
creating a lot of stress
and anxiety in my life.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.085 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was on the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange,

00:20:44.085 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting
a panic attack.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember telling
my boss at the time,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go run out
and get a cup of coffee.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And I left the floor, and
instead of going to get coffee,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I ran to a church.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I sat myself down on
the steps of Trinity Church,

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
outside the exchange, and
I just started crying,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know what else to do.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I felt all of this pressure,
and fear, and uncertainty,

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and self-doubt, thinking
like, I have this job.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a steady paycheck.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I should be so grateful
to have this position,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.195 align:middle line:90%
and all I want to do is quit.

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was going to be
a disappointment to my parents,

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and to my friends,
and to everyone.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And I remember calling
my dad on a cell phone

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and just bawling my
eyes out and saying,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Dad, I don't want
to disappoint you,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:90%
but I can't do this anymore.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.633 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the hell I want to do,

00:21:31.633 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:90%
but I gotta do something else.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said something to me
that forever changed my life.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Rie, you've worked
since you were nine years old.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
You started babysitting,
and selling ice cream,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.235 align:middle line:84%
and working at the beach,
and you've always worked.

00:21:45.235 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm not worrying
about you paying your bills.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
He goes, but you have to
find something that you love.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
find that, it's never

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
going to feel like work again.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So as long as it takes you to
try every different thing you

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
could possibly imagine,
you have to keep

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:90%
searching until you find it.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to quit, I'm
not going to be disappointed.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do
this, and you have

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.040 align:middle line:90%
to find something you love.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I hung up
for my dad, I remember

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
within like the next
week, I quit my job,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.848 align:middle line:84%
and I went on an
odyssey to find what

00:22:14.848 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I was meant to do in the world.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:10%
My first step was really
doing a bit of an excavation

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and asking myself, what
am I really interested in?

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:90%
What have I always been good at?

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:90%
What sounds exciting to me?

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I felt
paralyzed, because the thing

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that I had just spent four
years studying, the epitome

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:90%
of the job, that wasn't it.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So looking inside, I
really had two clues.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
One was that I was
very interested

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:90%
in the world of business.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a small
business owner,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:84%
so I understood what that
was like growing up with him.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other was
art and creativity.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I had always drawn,
and done fine art,

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and considered being
an animator for Disney,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.405 align:middle line:90%
or a fashion designer.

00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was like,
OK, well, how do I

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
mesh these two passions
around business,

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and small business, and
something around making money,

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:90%
but also, it has to be creative.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that came to
me was magazine publishing.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:10%
And I got into the ad sales
department of a magazine called

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:10%
"Gourmet," which was
part of Condé Nast,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:10%
that very big magazine
publishing company.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.512 align:middle line:84%
And I remember starting
and being so excited.

00:23:20.512 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, this
has gotta be it.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was thrilled to be
able to learn the business.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a great boss, and
I had a great publisher,

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were just these
powerful, strong, intelligent

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:90%
women.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But about six
months in, I started

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
hearing that voice again that
said, Marie, this isn't it.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, no.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Not this again.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:90%
No, not this again.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wait,
this has to be it.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
I have to tell you,

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I really started to
feel a sense of panic.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I started to feel broken.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had a ton
of potential in me.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was a hard worker.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted to
contribute to the world.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't seem to fit
in to the regular corporate

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.828 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I was
on the internet--

00:23:58.828 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
probably when I
shouldn't have been--

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and I stumbled upon this
article about a new profession

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:90%
at the time called coaching.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is back in 1999.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
This is well before coaching
was anything in the mainstream.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reading this article,

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and something in my heart lit
up like nothing ever before.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It really was one of
those moments where

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
it feels like the clouds parted,
and the angels were singing,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and sunbeams were
just shooting down.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And something in my soul,
something in my being

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
felt like this was right.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
This was something
that was more exciting.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:90%
There was something aligned.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to pursue it, even
though it didn't make sense.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So I signed up for a three-year
coach training program,

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and I started to do my
studies at night while I kept

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:90%
my magazine job during the day.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:84%
A few months in, I get a
call from the HR department.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to offer me a
promotion at "Vogue" magazine.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:90%
This was my fork in the road.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you take this
promotion, which

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:84%
is more money, and more
prestige, a steady paycheck,

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.745 align:middle line:90%
health benefits--

00:25:01.745 --> 00:25:03.120 align:middle line:84%
all of the things
that one should

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:84%
want when you're getting
started in your career--

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
or do you quit and
do this weird thing

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.133 align:middle line:84%
that no one has ever
heard of called coaching

00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and start your own
business, which

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea how
to do, and you're

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
carrying thousands and
thousands of dollars of debt

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
from college, and you have
to take care of yourself.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:90%
So of course, I quit.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And I started bartending,
and waiting tables, and doing

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:90%
every odd job I possibly could.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And I started working on
my business during the day,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and just hustling my buns
off on nights and weekends

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:90%
to fund this brand new business.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT MUSIC]

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, I recognized
that one of my greatest

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
abilities was to be able
to communicate with people.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I love teaching on video.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.603 align:middle line:84%
I had a part of my career
in health and fitness

00:25:51.603 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
where I was teaching hip hop,
and I was a Nike Elite dance

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
athlete, and I was creating
all these fitness videos.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that I loved

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
about that was just being able
to talk to people straight

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to camera and show
them how to do things,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and have them go from
feeling insecure and afraid

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of self-doubt to
this other place of like,

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.615 align:middle line:90%
oh my goodness, I can do this.

00:26:08.615 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
one of my superpowers.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That helps people
really take what

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
it is that they want
to do in this world

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and bring it to life.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
If there's a change they
want to make in their health,

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
or in their relationships,
or in their financial life,

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
or in their mental
or emotional health,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
or they want to take this
idea they have for a business

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.047 align:middle line:84%
and grow it, or their
existing business,

00:26:26.047 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and take it to new
heights, a lot of it

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
comes from really simple
tools and the application

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.900 align:middle line:90%
of those tools consistently.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.302 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us don't have
voices of encouragement.

00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think when any of
us are feeling lost,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:84%
or feeling stuck,
or feeling like,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
gosh, nothing's
working right now,

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
best things we can do--

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's so counter-intuitive--
is we have to celebrate.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to celebrate the fact
that we're in a tough spot.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we're about to have
some kind of breakthrough.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Something in our
life is not working,

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and we've gotten
ourselves to the point

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're willing
to take action

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
to do something about it,
so that means change is

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:90%
on the horizon.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.512 align:middle line:84%
So again, I know it's a
little counter-intuitive,

00:27:08.512 --> 00:27:10.137 align:middle line:84%
but please, take a
minute to celebrate,

00:27:10.137 --> 00:27:12.095 align:middle line:84%
because something's
off-track, and you're going

00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:90%
to get it right back on track.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:84%
The next thing we got to
do is start where we are.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.625 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, we think we
have to change everything.

00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But really, what we have
to change is our attitude,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:90%
and how we're showing up.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So can you start with
the little things?

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, can
you make your bed

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:90%
with enthusiasm and passion?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Can you be the best
damn bed-maker ever?

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you brush your teeth
like you really mean it?

with your family

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.200 align:middle line:84%
like they're the
best family ever?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you show up at
work and actually

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
give your excellence, and your
best, and your heart and soul?

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you go into
that grocery store,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
can you put a smile
on somebody's face?

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I know these things may
sound trite or insignificant,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't be miserable

day complaining,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%

working, and then expect

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:90%
to have some big breakthrough.

I'm going to show up, and I'm
going to look for some answers.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
up, and I am going

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.677 align:middle line:84%
to be this person who
is open to new ideas.

00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
up, and I'm actually

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
going to put a smile
on someone else's face.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take the
attention off myself

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.057 align:middle line:84%
and how I might
think that there's

00:28:15.057 --> 00:28:17.633 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with
me, and in that putting

00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
my attention on someone
else, I might actually

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
discover new answers
or new possibilities.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think when
we're stuck, I think

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
when we're finding
ourselves in a bit of pain,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
or we're feeling like nothing's
working, first, to celebrate,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and then to start changing
how we're showing up

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.156 align:middle line:84%
in the micro moments can create
a big trajectory of change.

nowhere near as abrasive

as the emotional trauma of what
it caused me to miss out on.

me my entire childhood.

when I was in fourth grade.

I was out of my wheelchair.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%

I catch my left leg

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:90%
on the corner of the door.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I bent it back, and I
snapped it at the femur.

Between hearing the sound of
the snap, and feeling the pain.

And even though it's a
fraction of a second,

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:10%
it feels like an
eternity, because you

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:10%
visualize everything you're
going to miss out on.

is this going to be a gift

First of all, I
thought she was crazy.

00:30:36.143 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I
have had gifts, right?

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%

bigger, grander purpose

ideas and models to help you

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:10%
find your purpose.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.650 align:middle line:10%
One of the best
models I've learned

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:10%
comes from a writer called
Amir Ahmad Nasr, who is

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:10%
a Sudanese refugee in Canada.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
Amir, and he showed me

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:84%
how often the pain that we go
through during our childhood,

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
during our growth
periods, is really

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:84%
a sign of what our
greater purpose is.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So think back of that pain that
you went through as a child.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
that was for you.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%

clues to what your purpose is.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
want to quit, not want to check
out, not want to numb yourself.

have to be painful.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to make this mean?

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:84%

to choose to have

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.573 align:middle line:84%

this moment be joyous?

00:32:36.573 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:84%

back in our energy going,

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I wish this was different?

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no way it can be
different, so that's useless.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to engage
with our full enthusiasm,

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:46.967 align:middle line:90%
and our joy?

00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to show
up in each moment

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
like we're really
meant to be there?

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
and train ourselves

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.140 align:middle line:84%
to do that consistently, all
of a sudden, joy and meaning

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and fulfillment becomes a habit.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of living.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a way that we engage
with the world around us.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.743 align:middle line:84%
So it's less of something
that we're looking for,

00:33:04.743 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's more of
something that we

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:90%
bring to everywhere we show up.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Some things don't
make sense in the moment.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, over the
course of our lives,

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:90%
we can see the greater picture.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And whenever something is
unfair or upsetting to me,

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I just know, OK, wait,
I'm too zoomed in.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
If I zoom out, I'm going
to see that this is not

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:90%
happening to me, but for me.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:90%
There's two ways to feel good.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:84%
You can gratify yourself, which
is pleasure now, pay later,

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and then there's fulfillment,
which is effort now,

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:90%
pleasure later.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you are
growing your mind,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.560 align:middle line:84%
your body, your
spirit, and/or you're

00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:84%
giving back to your planet and
others, that's so fulfilling.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been a therapist
for 16 years.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've never had somebody
sit down on my couch

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and say, Shawn, every morning,
I do self-care rituals.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.144 align:middle line:90%
I kiss my kids goodbye.

00:34:13.144 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I then spend five hours in the
homeless shelter, feeding them,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and I knit blankets for
children over in Africa,

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.015 align:middle line:84%
and gosh, I just
want to kill myself.

00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I've never had it happen once.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
it doesn't exist,

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:90%
but I have never seen it.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:84%
When a human being is growing
their mind, body, and spirit,

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're giving back to the
planet and humanity at large,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:90%
it's so darn fulfilling.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are three types
of pursuits that bring us

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.300 align:middle line:90%
fulfillment.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking at
this from the point of view

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are souls here in a meat
body on a giant rock hurtling

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:84%
through space having
a human experience.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:90%
So the three things are this.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:90%
The first is human experiences.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And experiences are
not necessarily things

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:90%
that money can buy.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:84%
An experience could be a kiss
with someone you really love.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be holding a child,
your child in your arms.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It could be an extreme sport,
or eating a food that you so

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:90%
enjoy, or laughing with friends.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You do not need money for
many of these experiences.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the first question you
want to ask yourself is not,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
what goals do I want in
life, because goals may not

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.788 align:middle line:84%
necessarily lead to
happiness or fulfillment.

00:35:30.788 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:84%
The first question you
want to ask yourself

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:90%
is, what experiences do I want?

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:90%
But there's a second question.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that causes
our souls to get fulfilled

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:90%
is growth.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of
the reasons we are here

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:90%
is to grow and evolve.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So the second question
you want to ask yourself

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.348 align:middle line:90%
is, how am I going to grow?

00:35:52.348 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
want to actually make

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.630 align:middle line:84%
a list of all the
opportunities and ways you

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:90%
want to grow as a human being.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
a new language.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
a new skill.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.338 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
public speaking.

00:36:02.338 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Learning to be a better parent.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
mindfulness, or meditation,

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.700 align:middle line:84%
or create a visualization,
or harnessing your intuition.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But we gain fulfillment
from growth.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:90%
But there is a third question.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
That third question is, look,
if I was a human being who

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:84%
had all of these
beautiful experience, who

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:84%
has grown in all of
these amazing ways,

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:84%
how can I give
back to the world?

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And giving back or
contribution is the third step

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:90%
to fulfillment.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:90%
You want to be happy?

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Make other people happy.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Contribution is
where you make a list

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of all the ways you can
contribute to pushing humanity

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.300 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's charitable giving,
or raising spectacular kids,

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:84%
or volunteering, or starting a
company, or building something

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that can actually make
an impact in the world.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Contribution is that third step.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So really, the path
to fulfillment,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself the three
most important questions.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:84%
What experiences
do I want in life?

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to grow?

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.705 align:middle line:90%
And how do I want to contribute?

00:37:06.705 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if you don't resonate
with those questions,

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:84%
they're not exactly yours,
figure out your questions.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Figure out, at the
end of my life,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.668 align:middle line:90%
how would I evaluate my life?

00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:84%
What questions would I
ask to know whether or not

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.148 align:middle line:90%
I lived a good life?

00:37:19.148 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if you find out what
those questions are-- just

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:90%
make them up.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Decide.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, I might ask,
am I a good mom?

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I might ask, did I
follow my passion?

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I might ask, did I honor
the gifts that God gave me?

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Find out what questions
you're going to ask.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And once you know what
those questions are,

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:84%
then you can live
each day intentionally

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:84%
so you're happy with
the answers at the end.

00:43:09.098 --> 00:43:14.521 align:middle line:84%
So stop, I'm going to
be there for you now.

00:43:14.521 --> 00:43:19.451 align:middle line:10%
Don't go, I'm going to
be there for you now.

00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:27.832 align:middle line:10%
You, always you.

00:43:27.832 --> 00:43:31.283 align:middle line:90%
Always you.

00:43:35.227 --> 00:43:40.910 align:middle line:10%
I'll walk you through the
sunshine and the rain.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe that second
chances come again.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:50.050 align:middle line:10%
So maybe, maybe,
no longer call us

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:55.930 align:middle line:10%
crazy, a feeling I
know it wasn't wrong.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So one day, you're
going to be my lover.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:06.813 align:middle line:84%
Everybody run for cover,
the ceiling's falling down.

00:44:06.813 --> 00:44:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we're
going to be forever.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody said we'd never,
and the ceiling's coming down.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:10%
So stop, I'm going to
be there for you now.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't go, I'm going to
be there for you now.

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:90%
You, always you.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Always you.
