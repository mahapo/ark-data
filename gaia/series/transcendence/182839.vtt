see the oncologist,

and he gives me this really
standard pitch, you know?

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
You've got stage
III colon cancer.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got about a
60% chance of living

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
five years with treatment.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%

What if it's worse, you know?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
We asked him about alternative
therapies, and he said--

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:90%
he was like, no.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%

do chemotherapy, you're insane.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
The most important
point is, all the cells

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
are genetically
identical, because they

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:90%
came from one parent.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So I have 50,000
genetically-identical cells,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I split them up into three
different Petri dishes,

It's the equivalent to blood.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So in environment A,
the cells form muscle.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
In environment B,
genetically identical cells

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
in a different
environment form bone.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And in environment C,
the cells form fat cells.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So the fate of the cells--

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
muscle, bone, fat,
wasn't based on genetics.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:90%

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%

What chemistry should the

to love, which is dopamine,
pleasure, oxytocin,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Vasopressin, a
chemical in my blood

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that causes my cells to become
more attractive to my mate.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And growth hormone is
released when you're in love.

causes you to become healthy.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm saying, when
a mind perceives love,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry from
that brain is chemistry

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:90%
that enhances your vitality.

That's why, when people
are in love, they glow.

00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%

and see something
that scares them,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
will not release the same
chemistry as in love.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid, you
release stress hormones,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and inflammatory agents that
affect the immune system.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.217 align:middle line:90%
So I say, oh my goodness.

00:07:18.217 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
If I open up my eyes and I
see something that scares me,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
then cortisone,
and norepinephrine,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and inflammatory agents
called cytokines are released

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%
into the culture medium--

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
hyper-fear anxiety situation,
and he's belittling me,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.875 align:middle line:84%
and just talking down to me,
and just kind of, you know,

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
essentially saying, if you don't
do what I'm telling you to do,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.665 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die.

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Something he said just
kind of pokes through,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.217 align:middle line:84%
and he says, blah, blah, blah,
and I'm not telling you this

00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:52.425 align:middle line:90%
because I need your business.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait
a minute, this guy--

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:90%
this sounds like a sales pitch.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I was in sales, and this guy's
doing the push away technique

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:90%
on me right now.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So even though I had these sort
of, you know, little epiphanies

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and was kind of getting
these clues at our meeting,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the fear was so strong
and so powerful,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety,
that like a robot,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I basically finished
our meeting,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and walked straight to the
desk, and made an appointment

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:90%
to start chemo.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I made a fear-based
decision, you know?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'm afraid
I'm going to die,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
so OK, I guess I've got to
do chemo if I want to live.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:43.505 align:middle line:84%
I just so desperately wanted
an option that wasn't scary,

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:45.203 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have one.

00:08:45.203 --> 00:08:48.584 align:middle line:90%

00:08:48.584 --> 00:08:51.482 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.482 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When we are in fear, stress,
the stress hormones shut down

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It's so effective at shutting
down the immune system

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that doctors use stress
hormones therapeutically,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
meaning if I want to
transplant a foreign organ

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
into a recipient, I don't want
the recipient's immune system

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
to reject that organ, I give
the recipient stress hormones

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
before transplanting
in the organ.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so effective
in shutting down

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the immune system,
it allows the organ

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
to take hold before the
immune system activates.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're using stress
hormones therapeutically

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to shut down the
immune system, what

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
does that mean for the
average person, who

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:90%
is now living in stress 24/7?

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
we are inhibiting

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:90%
our immune system every day.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
That immune system is
responsible for preventing

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
cancer, because every
day, normal people

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
create cancer cells, but
a healthy immune system

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.765 align:middle line:90%
will always get rid of it.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But if we look at
people's everyday lives,

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what leads people
to make stress hormones today,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
it's not the tiger coming
out of the jungle at us,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
or someone from another tribe
chasing us with their spear.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not those--
usually, thankfully,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
those physical
threats to our life.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
What leads us to make things
like adrenaline and cortisol

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
today, block your ears, is
caffeine, and our perception

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
of pressure and urgency.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I choose those
words very carefully,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
because we can tend to forget
that pressure and urgency is

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%
a perception.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
We actually choose to
see our day like that.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And what so many
people have done

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is made their email inbox
full of stress, and pressure,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
and urgency.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
When we wake up in
the morning, and we

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
see our day as
difficult, or we see it

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that everything is urgent,
when maybe, in reality,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
two things are
actually urgent, we

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
put ourselves into what's called
sympathetic nervous system

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
dominance, which is essentially
the fight or flight response.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's adrenaline
driving that.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So it changes our
biochemistry on the inside,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because it literally thinks
our life is in danger, so it

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:90%
prepares us to get away.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
[BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF INFLATING]

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing it does is
elevate our blood pressure,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
which is an ongoing
problem for so many adults

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It changes where our
blood supply is directed.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So normally blood
supply is fantastic

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.098 align:middle line:84%
to our digestive system,
but it gets diverted away

00:11:17.098 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
to the periphery, to
the arms and the legs,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.265 align:middle line:84%
to power us to
get out of danger.

00:11:20.265 --> 00:11:24.704 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have three
types of stress--

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.307 align:middle line:84%
physical, chemical,
and emotional.

00:11:30.307 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Physical stress, of
course, is trauma,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:90%
injuries, accidents, falls.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Chemical stress is flus,
bacterial infections,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
blood sugar levels, hangovers.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Emotional stress-- family
tragedies, second mortgages,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:90%
single parenting, 401(k)s.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:84%
All of those things knock the
brain and body out of balance.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so then, it's a
combination of all those things

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:90%
with chronic conditions.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.907 align:middle line:84%
And so when we talk about
anxiety and depression,

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
anxiety and depression
on a functional brain

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:90%
scan it looks exactly the same.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is when we are
knocked out of balance,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.662 align:middle line:84%
and when we are knocked
out of homeostasis,

00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
or we're knocked
out of balance, we

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
turn on what's called
the stress response.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And when the stress
response is turned on,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
we mobilize enormous amounts
of the body's resources

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:84%
for some threat in our
external environment.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We turn on that sympathetic
nervous system, or the fight

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
or flight nervous system.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to mobilize
all that energy, of course,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.746 align:middle line:84%
it gives the body a
rush of adrenaline--

00:12:30.746 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> -- which changes the fuel
that your body perceives it is

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:90%
safe to use.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So in any given moment,
the body is making

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:90%
a decision which fuel to use.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it can only use glucose, or
fat, or a combination of both.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And when your body
is on red alert,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's got to get
out of danger quickly,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
it needs a fast-burning
fuel to power it to do that.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:10%
So take a wild guess
between glucose and fat,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:10%
which is the preferred
fuel source in that moment?

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:10%
It's glucose.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.615 align:middle line:10%
So I have literally met
thousands of people,

00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:10%
in the almost 20 years
that I've been working

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:10%
with people one-on-one, who have
lost the ability to effectively

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:10%
use their body fat as a
fuel, because they're always

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
relying on their glucose,
because of stress hormone

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:10%
production.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
That's essentially
phase one of stress,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:90%
which is high adrenaline.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But because with
high adrenaline,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
it creates a lot of
inflammation in the body.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Now the body knows that
inflammation is the beginning

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:90%
of most degenerative disease.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to
keep you alive,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
so it needs to dampen
down that inflammation.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And because, historically,
adrenaline production

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
was short-lived-- we
escaped from the danger,

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
we won the fight, whatever
happened happened,

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:90%
but it was short-lived.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And now that you've been making
adrenaline for the last year,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
or decade, the
body says, well, I

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
can't sustain this
level of inflammation.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I now need to go into the
second phase of stress,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
which is when your
cortisol starts to elevate.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we're producing
excessive amounts of cortisol,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
its job is to slow
your metabolism down

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:90%
to get you through a famine.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And so your clothes get tighter.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's most
people's response

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:90%
when their clothes get tighter?

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, I
better go on a diet.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you go on
a diet, you tend

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
to eat less, which just confirms
to your body what it perceives

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is true, which is that there's
no food left in the world.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.517 align:middle line:84%
And so it slows your
metabolism even further.

00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:23.646 align:middle line:90%

When the stress

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:84%

All of a sudden their
body's altered internally.

They're looking at
the doctor, they're

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
taking a snapshot
of that moment,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:84%
they're creating a
long-term memory.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Every time they think
about what the doctor said,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they're conditioning their body
to become the mind of fear.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So then people, then, when
they hear the voodoo curse,

when they get the
death sentence--

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
three months to live, six months
to live, nine months to live,

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:90%
12 months to live--

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that information
goes right in, and it

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
begins to program their
autonomic nervous system

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:90%
to that outcome.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is
then the person is

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
at war with themselves,
because they're

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the
diagnosis to change

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to feel the relief from
the fear and emptiness

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:90%
that they're experiencing.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%

Well, all that stress has been
contributing to their disease.

00:30:00.852 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Now they get a stress bomb,
and their immune system

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:90%
goes even lower, right?

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:90%
And they become even weaker.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's scary.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.897 align:middle line:84%

no one is talking about.

>> When we're always in
that stressed out place,

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
you can go into adrenal fatigue,
which is when the adrenal

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
glands can no longer sustain
that level of cortisol output.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up
in the morning, you

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.658 align:middle line:84%
feel like you've
been hit by a bus.

00:30:37.658 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:84%
The fatigue is deep
and relentless.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So the consequences of
being intensely busy,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and perceiving all that pressure
and urgency in our lives,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
the long-term
consequences of that

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:90%
are deeply concerning to me.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And it also doesn't
have to be that way,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.130 align:middle line:84%
because if we pause for
a minute and consider

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:84%
what the real currency of health
is, I believe it's energy.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But when we stop and
think about energy,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have energy,
everything is more difficult.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're tired,

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%

the friends that you
make, your self talk,

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.457 align:middle line:84%

On a physical level, when we're
in sympathetic nervous system

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
dominance-- when we're
in that red zone,

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
in that fight or
flight response,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the only thing science
currently knows

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that will get us out
of that is to extend

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:90%
the length of our exhalation.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So the other arm of
the nervous system

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is called the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the rest, digest,
repair, reproduce arm

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And from that place, our body
is able to work so incredibly

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.210 align:middle line:90%
efficiently.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We're able to use our body
fat effectively as a fuel,

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's simply
because it's getting

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the message, via the nervous
system, that it is safe.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:90%
We need to become breath aware.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So essentially what
I mean by that is,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.105 align:middle line:84%
we need to
diaphragmatically breathe.

00:32:08.105 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe in
through your nostrils,

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:84%
with the inhalation, your
tummy starts to stick out.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a gentle pause
at the end of that inhalation,

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.098 align:middle line:90%
and then you slowly exhale--

00:32:18.098 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:84%
again, through your nostrils,
and your belly comes back

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.200 align:middle line:90%
in towards your spine.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you can really slow
that style of breathing down,

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:84%
your body gets the message
via your nervous system

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:90%
that you're safe.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart starts getting
very orderly, and very rhythmic,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and it sends a very strong
signal to the brain,

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and the person starts to
relax, they start to feel safe.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes,
because they start

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.816 align:middle line:90%
to change their breathing.

00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Obviously, we
all have to breathe,

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.865 align:middle line:84%
but it's reminding ourselves
to become breath-aware through

00:32:49.865 --> 00:32:51.240 align:middle line:90%
a potentially busy day.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So you might start with
a breath focus practice,

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's yoga, meditation,
polarities, tai chi.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:84%
If none of those
things appeal, it

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:84%
might just be
going to the window

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
or going outside, placing your
hands on top of your tummy,

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.387 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of the things
that you're grateful for.

00:33:06.387 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It might be every time you
stopped at red traffic lights

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
instead of checking
social media,

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.820 align:middle line:84%
or sending emails, you actually
breathe diaphragmatically.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
When you boil the kettle
first thing in the morning,

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
to make warm water and
lemon juice, of course,

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
you stand there and
breathe diaphragmatically.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So just taking
those micro-pauses

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day to
check in with your breath,

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and just commit to
becoming more breath-aware.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The more time we spend in
that diaphragmatic breathing

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.354 align:middle line:84%
place, the more supported our
nervous system is going to be.

00:33:35.354 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We now know that the effect
of stress on the body is

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:90%
profound.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And even if you eat perfectly,
if you're chronically stressed,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you can create depressed
immune function.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You can cause gut
disruption, a leaky guy.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
You can cause depression.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You can create
inflammation of the body.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And so techniques that help
the body to reset and restore

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%
are critical.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the key
foundational principles

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:90%
of functional medicine.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So in my practice,
I often recommend

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:84%
people learn various
techniques that

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:84%
work for them,
whether it's yoga,

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's meditation, or
prayer, or nature experiences.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I find
meditation very powerful.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I think the literature
on it is profound

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:84%
in terms of optimizing
gene expression,

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
regulating immune system,
affecting the brain structure,

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
increasing neuroplasticity, the
connection between brain cells,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:84%
creating new brain
cells, increasing stem

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.587 align:middle line:90%
cell production of the body.

00:34:26.587 --> 00:34:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not just this
eastern hokey pokey thing,

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
that it actually has real
biologic effects that

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:90%
transform your health everyday.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's one of the
most powerful things I've

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:84%
begun to do as a practice,
because other than food

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
as medicine and
exercise, it's probably

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.855 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important levers
I found to create my own health

00:34:44.855 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%

help my patients.

He worked with prostate

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:84%

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Before the 90-day
experiment, they

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
read the genetics
of both populations.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.810 align:middle line:84%

treatment.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.230 align:middle line:84%
The second group was

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:90%
And what did he do?

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
He taught them stress
reduction techniques.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
He taught them how to
meditate and he taught them

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
how to have a better diet.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
After 90 days, they read
the genes of both groups.

The group that got the
conventional treatment,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.150 align:middle line:84%
the genes essentially stayed the
same as they were for 90 days.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But the group that changed
lifestyle, 500 genes

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.680 align:middle line:84%
changed their
function in 90 days.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of the genes were
contributing to the cancer.

Just changing lifestyle,
just changing diet

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.450 align:middle line:84%
rewrote the genetics
of that individual

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.800 align:middle line:90%

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So I stayed in far too long,
and I almost suffocated.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.700 align:middle line:10%
It enables you to reconnect
with the immune system,

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.740 align:middle line:10%
suddenly feel the
power that you are

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:10%
able, just by
breathing and believing

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:58.890 align:middle line:10%
to prevent from disease, to
become stronger in performance,

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:03.640 align:middle line:10%
to gain confidence
and trust that you

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:09.230 align:middle line:10%
are in charge of your own
mood, health, strength.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Just do it, 20
minutes, and boom.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And the transportation system,
which is the vascular system,

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.870 align:middle line:90%
just take a cold shower.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:10%
You got to clean up anyway.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:26.120 align:middle line:10%
So you take a nice warm one
hot as you wish, but end cold.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Like half a minute to
a minute, that's all.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.480 align:middle line:10%
That's just to
ignite, to stimulate

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:10%
this beautiful vascular system
who wants to work with you.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.110 align:middle line:10%
But it needs some
activation, and it's

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.000 align:middle line:10%
done by a little bit of cold.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.680 align:middle line:10%
So only those two already
enable you to go far deeper

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.360 align:middle line:10%
in your physiology.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.790 align:middle line:10%
Then little by
little, you find out

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:10%
you are able to do so much more.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Then little by
little, the confidence

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.590 align:middle line:84%
entered inside of
your own body and mind

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
is grown automatically,
naturally.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We want to bring back
the belief, to belief

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.820 align:middle line:90%
of mother nature within.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It's there for
everybody, and it showed.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:84%
All these 18 persons, 12
of them randomly selected,

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:84%
they were exposed
with the bacteria.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:24.360 align:middle line:84%
All, they had to control
within a quarter of an hour

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.080 align:middle line:84%
over the bacteria
injected reacting

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:84%
on the immune system,
all of them, 100%.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.604 align:middle line:84%
What consequences will
this give for health care?

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.270 align:middle line:10%
You should be able to control
your mood, which is hormonal,

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:10.760 align:middle line:10%
your strength, which is
hormonal, adrenaline, cortisol,

epinephrine, and your health,
which is the immune system.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we are the first
ones in scientific history

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to show that we
are able to go back

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:25.840 align:middle line:84%
to the depth of our physiology
far more than scientifically

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.580 align:middle line:90%
stated.

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We are the first ones to show
that the autonomic nervous

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:36.470 align:middle line:84%
system can be influenced
deeply to prevent from disease,

00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:39.590 align:middle line:84%
prevent from depression,
to have a lot

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:90%
more control over your life.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Happiness, strength,
and health, those

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:10%
are the most important
assets of life,

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:54.410 align:middle line:10%
not money, not greed for power,
no politics, no possession, no.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:56.762 align:middle line:90%
Happiness, strength, health.

>> I did get well, and my
wife and I started a family.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I have two girls that are
eight and 11 years old now,

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 39.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It's been 13 years since I was
diagnosed, still cancer-free.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.455 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
power of my choice

00:51:17.455 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:90%
is not just to change my diet.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But also, I changed
the way I thought.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.620 align:middle line:84%
It changed my
attitude, my emotions.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I started to choose positivity.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I chose gratitude.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I stopped being bitter, and
envy, and jealous of people,

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I'm so
blessed to have what I have.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:43.750 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
created health in my body.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit here
now 13 years later

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.990 align:middle line:84%
in the best shape of my life
in the best health of my life.
