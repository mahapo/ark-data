[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> One incident in your life
could change everything.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I was in kindergarten,
and there was

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.740 align:middle line:90%
this noise outside the window.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.890 align:middle line:10%
And the teacher says, wow,
there are fire trucks outside.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.215 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I just lit
up, because I felt like they

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:10%
were real-life superheroes.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see
outside the window,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and all the kids started
grabbing their chairs.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And I grabbed my chair,
I was so excited.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:10%
And I bring it over
to the window sill.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:10%
And there's this big, iron grate
radiator dividing the window.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I finally got to
see my heroes, my face lit up.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:10%
And about a split second after
that, one of the other children

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:10%
grabbed my chair, and I went
face-first, head-first, right

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:10%
into the radiator.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:10%


00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:10%
I was bleeding, and I was
rushed to the hospital.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:10%
My mother said I was
never the same after that.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I had these learning
difficulties, very challenged

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:90%
focus.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:10%
My concentration was
really compromised.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:10%
I had a very poor memory.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't retain information.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.853 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to
read like the other kids.

00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't know
what was wrong with me.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:10%
It actually took me an extra
three to four years just

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:10%
to learn how to
read, and I actually

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:10%
taught myself how to read
by reading comic books late

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:10%
at night.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite superheroes
growing up actually

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
were the X-Men, because
they didn't fit in.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:90%
They were the mutants.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:90%
They were the outcasts.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And I felt, growing up with
these learning challenges,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't fit in.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was
one of those people

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:90%
without the superpowers.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I found out the X-Men
School for the Gifted run

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
by Professor X, Charles
Xavier, actually resided

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
right there in Westchester, New
York, and that's where I lived.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.912 align:middle line:10%
And so I remember,
every weekend,

00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:10%
when I was about eight
or nine years old,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:10%
I would ride my bicycle
around my neighborhood,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to
find that school,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:10%
because I wanted to run away.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to run away to find my
school, to find my superpowers,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:10%
to find my super friends.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And really, I remember
a defining moment

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:10%
when I was 9 years old.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:10%
I remember that a teacher
was talking to another adult,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:10%
thinking I wasn't
paying attention,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:10%
or maybe thinking that I wasn't
smart enough to understand

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:10%
what she was saying.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:10%
And she pointed
right at me and said,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:10%
that is the boy with
the broken brain.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember how
hard that hit me.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Children understand more than
you think that they understand,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and I remember always
referring back to that moment

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:90%
all through school.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I didn't
do well I was like,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's because
I know I'm broken.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It's because I'm different.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's because my
mind doesn't work

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else's does.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So all of high school was
this-- was my struggles.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I would work so much
harder than everybody else,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and I always thought
it was unfair,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
because my grades
didn't reflect that.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But I was lucky enough
to get into a university.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember freshman year
I took all these classes,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
ready to achieve, and
I actually did worse,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and things got even
more difficult for me.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:10%
And I was ready to quit school,
because I didn't have the money

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:10%
as it was to go to
college, and I didn't want

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:10%
to waste that and waste time.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:10%
And so when I told that to my
friend, my friend was like,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:10%
Jim, before you quit
school, tell your parents

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:10%
that you're leaving.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you come
with me this weekend?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to visit my
family this weekend.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Just get some time away.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Get some perspective.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.045 align:middle line:90%
So I agree to go there.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember,
right before dinner,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
his father was walking
me around his property.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're pretty well-to-do.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.815 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me this
very innocent question,

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
which is the worst question that
you could ask me at this time.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
He says, Jim, how's school?

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- it just hits me.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:10%
I start crying and
bawling right in front

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:10%
of this complete stranger.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:10%
And I tell him the whole story--
how I had a brain injury,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:10%
and I don't learn
like everybody else,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:10%
and I'm the boy with
the broken brain,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:10%
and school is just not for me.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.073 align:middle line:10%
And then he says, Jim,
stop for a minute.

00:04:18.073 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me
right in the eyes

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%
and asked me this question.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Says, Jim, why
are you in school?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.482 align:middle line:90%
Why are you in school?

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to be?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.372 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to have?

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to share?

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I never
thought about that before.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I start to answer
him, he says, stop.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls out, from
his back pocket, a diary--

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:84%
like, a journal-- and he
tears out a few sheets.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And he hands them
to me, and he makes

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
me write down my answers--

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.462 align:middle line:84%
my answers of who I want to
be, what do I want to do?

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to have?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:10%
What do I want to
share with the world?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know how much time
went by, but when I was done,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:10%
I start folding up the sheets
of paper to put in my pocket.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:10%
And he grabs them
right out of my hand.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm freaking out, because
I wasn't expecting anyone

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to see my dreams and
my fantasies, my goals.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.753 align:middle line:84%
And he starts reading
them to himself.

00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
When he's done-- I don't
know how much time went by.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But he looks at
me, says, Jim you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
are this close to every
single thing on that list.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking--
he spreads his fingers

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.995 align:middle line:90%
about a foot apart.

00:05:17.995 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
there's no way.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Give me 10 lifetimes, I'm
not going to crack that list.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And he takes his
fingers, and he puts them

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:90%
to the side of my head--

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:90%
my temple, right here--

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
meaning that between
my ears is the key.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:90%
It's my mind.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It's my brain.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And he walks me to
a room of his home,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's wall-to-wall,
ceiling-to-floor

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:90%
covered in books.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at
the title of these books,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and there are these biographies
of incredible men and women

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:90%
throughout history, .

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And some very early
personal growth books--

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Norman Vincent Peale, "The
Power of Positive Thinking,"

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
"The Magic of Thinking
Big," "Psycho-Cybernetics,"

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.780 align:middle line:84%
"Think and Grow Rich--"
all these books on mindset,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jim, I want you to
read one of these books a week.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.958 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, have you
not heard anything I've said?

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:10%
I have all of these learning
difficulties and all

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:10%
these learning problems.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:10%
I have so much schoolwork to do.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:10%
We have midterms.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:10%
And he says, stop.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
He's like, Jim,
don't let school get

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
in the way of your education.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But I said, that's
really good insight,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:90%
but I really can't do it.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to promise
this and break my promise.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And a very smart man--

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
what he does is he
reaches into his pocket

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and he pulls out my goals,
my dreams, my bucket

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:90%
list, if you will.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And this time, he starts reading
every single one of my goals,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
all my dreams, out loud.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And something about
hearing your dreams

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
coming from a stranger's
voice incanted out

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:90%
into the universe--

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:90%
it shook my heart.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It shook my spirit, my
soul something fierce.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:10%
So I commit to reading one
book a week with that leverage

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:10%
and motivation.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:10%
And fast forward--
now I'm at school,

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.743 align:middle line:10%
and I have a pile of books
that I have to read for school,

00:06:57.743 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:10%
and a pile of books that
I want to read that I

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:10%
promised to read for my life.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't even keep up
with one of those piles.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw the
mug of tea, and on it

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
had an incredible genius
named Albert Einstein,

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and it had a quote
there that said,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
"The same level of thinking
that's created the problem

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.073 align:middle line:90%
won't solve the problem."

00:07:18.073 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And it made me ask
a new question.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:10%
It made me ask this question--

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.787 align:middle line:10%
what's my problem?

00:07:22.787 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And I came up with this
answer saying, well,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm a real slow learner.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:10%
I learn very slowly.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:10%
I have a very slow brain.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, how do I think
differently about it?

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe I can learn
how to learn faster,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:10%
learn how to learn.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And another part of
me woke up, thinking,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
there has to be a better way.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.398 align:middle line:84%
>> People have seen the movie
"The Matrix," and they say, oh,

00:08:04.398 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:90%
that's a science fiction movie.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, the
matrix is a documentary.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:90%
We've all been programmed.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:10%
For 400 years, the Jesuits
have said, give me a child

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:10%
until it's seven, and I
will show you the man.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
What people didn't understand
they were saying is,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
if I get the program
the first seven years,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I will determine the outcome
of that individual's life.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
Very simple understanding--
if you go to an Apple store

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and you buy an iPod and you
take it out of the store

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and you push Play on
the iPod, nothing plays.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you're now upset
about the fact you just

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.042 align:middle line:84%
spent all this money, and
your iPod doesn't work,

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and then some little
seven-year-old kid next to you

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:84%
looks up and goes,
hey, hey mister,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
unless you download something
first, it will not work.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
The idea is exactly the same.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The mind has a
conscious creative mind,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but a subconscious
programmed mind.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind does
not go into full operation

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:90%
until after age seven.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The first seven years, the
mind is in a lower vibrational

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
state called theta.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The relevance of
theta is that it

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
represents imagination, which is
what kids under seven live in.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Half the world is imagination.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.508 align:middle line:84%
The mother says,
give me the broom.

00:09:21.508 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The child says, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
This is a horse.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So to the child, the broom, in
the imagination state of theta,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:90%
actually is the horse.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:90%
So theta is imagination.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
More important,
theta is hypnosis.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
The relevance about
that is if you

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:84%
think of all the rules
an individual must learn

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to become a functional
member of a family

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and a community,
thousands of rules.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, how do you teach
an infant thousands of rules?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, well, you
can't give them a book,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and you can't teach
them in a school.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we have
to understand is this--

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
nature created the first seven
years of download hypnosis

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
to observe other people--
the parents, the siblings,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:90%
and the community--

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
observe their behavior
and directly download

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
their behavior as the
foundational download

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of behavior.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're
babies, we believe,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in our autonomic
nervous system--

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
the part that we can't
govern with our thoughts,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
the part we can't instruct--

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:84%
we believe, deeply in that
autonomic nervous system,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that love is essential
for our survival,

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
because as small
human babies, it is.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.732 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to care
enough about us

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to give us food and
clothing and shelter.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We can't get those
things on our own.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Other Animal species can do
it from day one by themselves,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
but we can't.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So it is there, in
our DNA, from the day

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
we are born that love is
essential for our survival.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But we know, as adults,
that a life with love in it

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is delicious and
soul-nourishing,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
but we can actually
live without it,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
because we can obtain our own
food and clothing and shelter.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, they
live their whole life

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
believing that love is still
essential for survival,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.415 align:middle line:84%
and it drives their
behavior hugely.

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And here's the best
way I've come to be

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
able to explain that so far--

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
when we are little, from
an emotional maturation

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
perspective, we are
what's called egocentric.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So you believe that
the way that people

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
are in your
environment-- you believe

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
they are the way they
are because of you.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So when they're happy, you link
it, in your mind, immediately--

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
not consciously; it's wired
in your nervous system

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:90%
immediately--

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that's because I
just told a joke.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
That's because I just did a
beautiful finger painting.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And so parts of your
personality are born from that.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The observations you
make on people's faces

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that light them up-- you
link it to your own behavior.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
However, sadly,
the same thing also

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
happens when the people
in your environment

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:90%
are dissatisfied or unhappy.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
You link it to you.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So before the age of
seven, every single human

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
has created a belief in
their own deficiency.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And we do it to make
sense of our environment.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.628 align:middle line:84%
Let's say normally when
your dad comes home

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
from work the first thing
he does is picks you up

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.405 align:middle line:90%
and plays with you.

00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
You love it.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You look forward to it.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.712 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
he doesn't do that,

00:12:12.712 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and you're sent to your room.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.423 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
he and your mother

00:12:15.423 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
having an intense
conversation in the kitchen.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:90%
There's raised voices.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
There's fist-banging
on the table.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:10%
And you don't understand it,
other than that it feels yucky

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:10%
in your nervous system.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, in that moment,
is looking for an explanation

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
for this scenario,
because it's brand new,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:90%
and it's uncomfortable for you.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can't look
into their world

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and see that dad's behaving
with such intensity

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
because he was just
made redundant,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.748 align:middle line:84%
and now he doesn't
know how on Earth he's

00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:90%
going to pay for your education.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So the expression with
intensity is actually

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
out of deep love
and care for you.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't see that
when your egocentric.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
All you know is that
it feels uncomfortable.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.462 align:middle line:84%
And the only way your brain can
make sense of what's going on

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to
believe that there's

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with you.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're children, we have
this thing in our head that I

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:90%
call the meaning-making machine.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And a meaning-making
machine tries

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
to grant meaning to everything
that happens in our lives.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Our mom or our dad yell at
us or send us to a corner,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and we may not necessarily
get the meaning that they

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:90%
are trying to install on us.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
They may simply be trying
to make us more disciplined.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:90%
We may take on our own meanings.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Mom wants me in a corner because
I'm not important to her.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Dad asks me to be quiet
because he doesn't

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
want to hear what I have
to say, because what I say

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
isn't important.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Mom doesn't want
to talk to me today

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:90%
because she doesn't love me.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
See, kids don't
have adult brains.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:90%
They are children.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But this meaning-making
machine creates these meanings

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that stick with them,
infuse into them,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.038 align:middle line:84%
and stay with them
into adulthood.

00:13:48.038 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most common
meanings, according

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to psychologists and therapists
like Marissa Pierre or Shelly

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Lefkoe are the ideas that
I am not good enough.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I am not important.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I am not loved.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What I have to say
is not important.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And these things
hold us back in life.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But the trick is is that
we're not taught to see

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:90%
our brain as a meaning-maker.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught to see
that nothing in the world

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:84%
has meaning unless
we give it meaning.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So because we don't
understand that

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're not aware that we've
just created a belief, what

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
then happens is you go looking
for evidence of your beliefs

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.782 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:14:27.782 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of our brain
called the reticular activating

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
system that hunts
those things down.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that
people can't be trusted,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
you will look for evidence of
how that is true everywhere,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.975 align:middle line:84%
and you'll miss all the
examples of how it's not true.

00:14:40.975 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that there
aren't enough hours in the day,

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:90%
that will be your experience.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll live your life
with such intensity,

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
there aren't enough hours in
the day, whereas the person who

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:90%
sits at the desk beside you--

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
they might have 50 more things
on their to-do list each day,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.515 align:middle line:84%
but they cruise through the
day, and they get more done,

00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and that's because they believe
that the important things

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:90%
always get done.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So your beliefs create
your experience.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:22.648 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.648 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The hardest part about the
programming is it occurs before

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:84%
your mind actually enters
into consciousness.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So the question
becomes, very seriously,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:90%
what are my programs?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And why it becomes
a question is you

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
were not even conscious when
the programs are downloaded.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So you say, well, I don't
know what my programs are.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I learned
when I was one-year-old.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So the exciting part
about it is that science

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
has recognized that
95% of our life

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
comes from
subconscious programs.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:90%
So a simple truth is this--

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
you look at your life, and it
is a printout of your programs.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's simple.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know who
said what, who did what.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
That's blaming the
messenger over the message.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The message is, what
did you learn-- program?

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, but
the program is what

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.293 align:middle line:90%
you're playing 95% of the time.

00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, look at your
life, and it comes down simple.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The things that you like
that come into your life

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
come in because you have
programs to accept those.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
The other part,
though, is anything

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that you work hard at,
struggle over, sweat over, what

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:90%
you put a lot of effort into--

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
question-- why are
you working so hard

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:90%
to make these things manifest?

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
The answer, inevitably, is your
programs in your subconscious

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:90%
do not support that end.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So the simple point is you
want to know your programming?

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Look at your life.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So when it comes to
understanding whether or not we

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:84%
have limiting beliefs,
one clue is to see

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
if there's a recurring
pattern in your life,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
if there's something that
you say that you want,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a reality for you
and it's been true for years

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and years and years, or even
months and months and months

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:90%
and you've been working on it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
a clue that there

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
could be a limiting belief
under there that you

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
need to investigate, and then
consciously work on changing.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think, when it comes
to limiting beliefs,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:84%
if there's any area in your
life that consistently creates

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pain, a lot of stress,
a lot of struggle or anxiety,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:84%
a good place to
peek around is say,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:90%
what do I believe about this?

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe that it's
possible to resolve?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe I'm worthy
of having this resolved?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I think investigating it on that
level from a place of curiosity

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.612 align:middle line:84%
is step 1, because if you're
not aware of the belief,

00:17:37.612 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to change it.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, where it really
showed up was my learning.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.648 align:middle line:84%
I had these learning
difficulties.

00:17:53.648 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:10%
So I think, how am I going
to learn how to learn?

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe schools.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:10%
I pick up a course bulletin,
looking at all the classes

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:10%
for next semester.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And I look at all these hundreds
of classes, and all of them

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:10%
are classes on what's learned--

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:10%
math, history, and
science, and Spanish.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:10%
But there were
zero classes on how

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:10%
to learn, how to think for
yourself, how to be creative,

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:10%
how to solve problems,
how to actively listen,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:10%
how to concentrate and
focus, how to read faster,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:10%
how to remember things.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Socrates says, "There is no
learning without remembering."

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:10%
So I put my studies aside, and
I make studying my studies.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to really
solve this riddle

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:10%
about how does my brain work?

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:10%
So I could work my brain.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:10%
How does my memory work?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:10%
So I could work my memory.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:10%
And I just started studying
positive psychology and adult

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:10%
learning theory and
multiple intelligences--

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:10%
anything I can get my hands
on on how to unlock this gift.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And an amazing thing
happened-- about two months

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
in this process, a
light switch flipped on,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and I started to understand
things in a different way.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I started to have better
focus, better concentration.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:90%
I started to read faster.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I started to be able
to think more clearly.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I had this new life inside of
my mind, and my grades improved.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, but my life
started to elevate and improve.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment,
I realized something.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if
knowledge is power,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:90%
learning is your superpower.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I talk about superheroes--
going back to the comic books

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and my reading
disability-- but really,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
modern-day superheroes--

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.025 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
super powers that

00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
allow you to leap tall
buildings and shoot lasers out

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:90%
of your eyes.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean modern-day
superpowers like your ability

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.106 align:middle line:10%
to think clearly, your ability
to have a proper mindset,

00:19:35.106 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:10%
and your ability to
engineer your habits,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:10%
your ability to manage your
own attitude, your ability

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:10%
to learn faster, to
focus, to concentrate.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:10%
Those are the things that I
really get excited about--

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:10%
that when people step into a
better version of themselves,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:10%
the version that they know
to be inside of them--

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:10%
I want to decode that.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So when people want
to make a change,

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
or they want to create a
transformation in their life,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:84%
most people look at
this level of behavior--

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:90%
the behavior.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to stop smoking,

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
or they want to be
able to meditate,

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
or they want to be able to
journal, and make it a habit.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And not self-sabotage,
or not put it off, or not

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%
procrastinate.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually, though,
they try to force it

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:84%
on the behavioral level, but
there are other levels also.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.665 align:middle line:84%
It's this level of
beliefs and values.

00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:26.465 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:27.965 align:middle line:84%
That basically says
that if you want

00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
to do this behavior
of, let's say,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
remembering people's names--
because a lot of people

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.528 align:middle line:90%
have trouble remembering names.

00:20:33.528 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes, maybe you have
the capabilities,

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.362 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't have the
belief that you could do it--

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.428 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have a belief
like you're too old.

00:20:39.428 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have a belief like,
oh, I'm not smart enough,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
or a belief that I'm just not
good at remembering names.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
That would keep you
from doing the behavior.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.635 align:middle line:84%
The other part of it is--
besides belief, my values.

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:90%
These are the values.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
you hold most important.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't think that it's
important to remember people's

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
names, the value will keep you
from doing the actual behavior.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, above beliefs and
values is another level.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the level of identity.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And the level of identity
is the level of I am.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.858 align:middle line:84%
They say these are the
most powerful two words

00:21:08.858 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in the language, because
anything that comes after that

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%
becomes your destiny.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:10%
And here's the thing-- someone
could create a behavior

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:10%
and say, I want to stop smoking.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I want to stop smoking.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But if their identity
is that of a smoker,

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:90%
they won't make that change.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody here could
say, oh, I want

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to remember
things better.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the behavior.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But their identity is,
I'm a forgetful person.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
That will keep them from
making that transformation.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I always tell people this--

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is that if you fight
for your limitations,

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.565 align:middle line:90%
you get to keep them.

00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember one day our office
gets a call from 20th Century

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Fox, and they wanted
me to be this very

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
special training for
the chairman of Fox

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:90%
and the executive team.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:10%
And I remember going there,
and I was so excited,

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:10%
because when I was going through
the hallway to the boardroom,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:10%
all these movie
posters were there--

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.313 align:middle line:10%
like "Star Wars" and "Avatar,"
and all the classics.

00:22:02.313 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:10%
And it made me feel like
I was a child again--

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:10%
that nine-year-old boy.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.725 align:middle line:84%
And I gave one of my
very best trainings

00:22:07.725 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
for their executive team,
and then when I was done,

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
the chairman of Fox said,
"Jim, thank you so much,"

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me this wonderful
tour of the Fox lot.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
going on this tour,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:10%
and out of the
corner of my eyes,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:10%
I see this "Wolverine" poster.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And I am such a big Hugh Jackman
"Wolverine" fan, and I said,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.878 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for that
movie to come out!

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:10%
And the chairman
picked up his phone,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:10%
and then five minutes later,
I'm in The Fox Theater watching

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Wolverine fight all
these super ninjas.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.195 align:middle line:10%
It was the best
Friday afternoon ever.

00:22:35.195 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:10%
And when he comes to
get me afterwards,

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:10%
he says, how is the movie?

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And because I'm still
in that childlike mode,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:10%
I just say, oh, you
don't know this?

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:43.433 align:middle line:10%
I tell him my whole story.

00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
He's like, Jim, I didn't
know you like superheroes.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:10%
How would you like to go on set?

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:10%
I was like, what do you mean?

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.157 align:middle line:84%
He's like, we have
another 30 days

00:22:50.157 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
of filming the new
X-Men movie in Montreal.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:90%
How would you like to go?

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had never been
on a film set before,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still acting like I'm
9 years old and think, yeah,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to--

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:90%
yes, I want to go.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Please take me.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.145 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
can I do for you?

00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jim, do the
same thing you did for us.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.788 align:middle line:84%
Share with them
your superpowers.

00:23:05.788 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Teach them how to
speed-read scripts,

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:84%
how to memorize their lines,
how to be focused on set.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said I could
absolutely do that.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:10%
So the next morning, we're
on what they call the X-Jet,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:10%
waiting on the plane as the
entire cast of "X-Men--"

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I just flip out.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Hugh Jackman,
Patrick Stewart.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even see Hugh
Jackman and Patrick Stewart.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I see Wolverine and
Professor X. And I'm

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
sitting in between Jennifer
Lawrence and Halle Berry,

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sharing
them my brain tips

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
for learning faster
and achieving more.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.288 align:middle line:10%
And when we get on set,
it's incredible coincidence

00:23:37.288 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:10%
that the scene that
they were filming

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:10%
takes place in the X-Men
School for the Gifted.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there, as a
nine-year-old boy,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
seeing my superheroes come
to life right in front of me.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:10%
When I go home, there's
a package waiting for me,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:10%
and it's the size
of a television set.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:10%
And I open it up, and
it's this photograph of me

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:10%
and the entire
cast of the X-Men.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:10%
But even better than that is
the note from the chairman.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:10%
It says this.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:10%
"Jim, thank you so much for
sharing your superpowers

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:10%
with all of us.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been looking
for superhero school

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:90%
since you were a child.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's your class photo."

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:10%
You know, as I look at my
life from where it began--

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:10%
from immigrant parents,
to having my head injury,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:10%
to being made fun of, to go
through all the bullying,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:10%
to feel like I'm not enough,
to not knowing how to read,

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.980 align:middle line:10%
to searching for my
superhero school as a child,

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:10%
to being labeled the boy
with the broken brain--

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:10%
when we take responsibility
for our lot in life,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:10%
we have great power to change
our lives and the lives

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:10%
of everyone around us.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Change our brain,
we change our life.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Change our brain, we
could change the world.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Biology's been telling us
for 100 years about the power

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:90%
It's called the placebo effect.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fascinating that you
can give someone a sugar pill,

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.430 align:middle line:84%
a saline injection, or
perform some false surgery

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
or treatment, and a certain
percentage of those people will

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
accept, believe, and
surrender to the thought--

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
without any analysis--
that they're

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
getting the real
substance or treatment,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
to make the exact
pharmacy of chemicals

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
equal to the
substance or treatment

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:90%
they think they're getting.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental question
is, is it the inert substance--

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:90%
the placebo--

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that's doing the healing, or is
it the body's innate capacity

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%
to heal by thought alone?

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Blue pills work
better than red pills.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If you name a drug something
that a person can't pronounce,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.155 align:middle line:84%
they'll give their
power away to the drug,

00:26:31.155 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and it'll work even better.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
They'll be intimidated by it.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
If you charge more
for a medication,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:90%
it will work better.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And if the doctor's
enthusiastic about it,

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.237 align:middle line:90%
it'll work even better.

00:26:43.237 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some amazing studies
that have come out about

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.448 align:middle line:90%
the power of belief.

00:26:46.448 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And they've come out
from the oddest place,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and that is from
pharmaceutical companies

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:84%
using placebos and trying to
beat the placebo for whatever

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:90%
drug they had.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding is
not how powerful their drug is,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
but how powerful beliefs are.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
have been studies

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
where they're testing
the effectiveness

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.712 align:middle line:90%
of an antidepressant.

00:27:05.712 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the antidepressant
is supposed

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:90%
to raise dopamine levels.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So they have one
group where they're

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:84%
given the antidepressant,
and another group

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.990 align:middle line:90%
where that's not--

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:90%
it's a placebo.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It means that they're
just given a sugar pill.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Not only are those people
no longer depressed,

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%
their dopamine levels raise.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
actually thought--

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
just from the power
of belief, they

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:84%
thought a specific
neurotransmitter would

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
get elevated, and they
were able to elevate

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.180 align:middle line:84%
a specific
neurotransmitter simply

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:90%
by the power of their belief.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.372 align:middle line:84%
There was another study
with chemotherapy.

00:27:38.372 --> 00:27:40.830 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to test the
effectiveness of chemotherapy,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.852 align:middle line:84%
and one group had
the chemotherapy,

00:27:42.852 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:84%
another group thought they
were getting chemotherapy,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:90%
but weren't.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The group that thought they
were getting chemotherapy--

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.345 align:middle line:90%
30% of them lost their hair.

00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.118 align:middle line:84%
They lost their hair
because they thought

00:27:57.118 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
they were getting chemotherapy.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:84%
With the power of
our beliefs, we

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:84%
have the power to
lose hair simply

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.478 align:middle line:84%
because we think that
we're supposed to.

00:28:04.478 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
We have the power to
raise dopamine levels,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.655 align:middle line:90%
to heal surgery.

00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
All of these
different things, we

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.447 align:middle line:84%
can do with the
power of our mind.

00:28:10.447 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So the belief, I'm going
to get cured, led to the cure.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, people understand
that, and they go, yes, I

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:90%
understand placebo effect.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.842 align:middle line:90%
That's positive thinking.

00:28:20.842 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, that's actually
what it is-- positive result.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
What I need people understand,
more importantly, is this--

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk about what is the
concept of negative thinking?

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Negative thinking is equally
powerful in controlling

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:84%
your biology as
positive thinking,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:84%
but it works in the
opposite direction.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.230 align:middle line:84%
While a positive-thinking
placebo effect

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:84%
can cure you of disease,
a negative belief,

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%
called the nocebo effect,
can cause disease.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is we
are very powerful.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.415 align:middle line:84%
It's only our belief that
is undermining our biology.

00:28:59.415 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.652 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, for some
of us to wake up,

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:90%
we need a wake up call.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And in 1986, I got the call.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I was in a triathlon in
Palm Springs, California.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the biking
portion of the race,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and I was making a
turn, and there was

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:90%
a police officer on the corner.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was pointing to
me to make the turn,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but he had his back to
the oncoming traffic.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was passing two
cyclists on the corner,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and when I made the turn,
a four-wheel drive vehicle

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:84%
going pretty fast catapulted
me out of my bike.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
When I landed, I broke
six vertebrae in my spine,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and the arch that the
spinal cord passed through

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:90%
had broken like a pretzel.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So I had multiple
compression fractures.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I had bone fragments
on the spinal cord,

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a little
bit of trouble.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And I had four opinions
from four leading surgeons

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
in Southern California.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
They told me that I'd
probably never walk again.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They told me that I
would have to live

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
in a body cast for
a year, and that I'd

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.270 align:middle line:90%
be handicapped in some way.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Typical surgery for
that type of injury

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is called the
Harrington rod surgery.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%
In my case, it was from
the base of my neck

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:90%
to the base of my spine.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
fuse my entire spine.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't so quick to
make that decision,

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:10%
because I thought that
I would be spending

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:10%
the rest of my life in pain,
or at least on medications,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:10%
or partially handicapped.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I decided against the surgery.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when you go
against convention like that,

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you're always considered
foolhardy and insane.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But I was willing
to weigh what I knew

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and see if I could heal
myself without having

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:90%
any surgical intervention.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they thought I had
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I hit my head, and that I
was not making any sense,

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:90%
or I wasn't being reasonable.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:90%
But I just had this thought--

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going anywhere.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm laying face down.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
the power that

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:90%
made the body heals the body.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I could give it a
plan, give it a template,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.410 align:middle line:90%
give it a design.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.907 align:middle line:84%
And when I was happy
with that design,

00:31:28.907 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I couldn't
do the healing,

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.640 align:middle line:84%
so I would surrender my
creation to a greater mind

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and just see what the autonomic
nervous system could do.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds really
easy, but I think

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that when we're in
crisis or trauma,

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we tend to focus on what we
don't want to have happen

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:84%
instead of what we do
want to have happen.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So I made a deal
with myself that I

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
was going to reconstruct
my entire spine,

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't going to let any
thought slip by my awareness

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want
to experience.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through about six
or seven weeks of total hell,

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.320 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't get my mind
to do what I wanted it to do.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd start off reconstructing
the vertebrae in my spine,

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
thing you know,

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd be thinking about
living the rest of my life

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:90%
in a wheelchair.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I become conscious
that I was focusing

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
on what I didn't
want to have happen

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of what I did
want to have happen.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd start from the
very beginning again,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'd reconstruct my spine,
and then I'd be thinking about,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
should I sell my home?

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Should I sell my practice?

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And all the people
in my life were

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:90%
telling me to sell everything.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But if I accepted the
belief on some level

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that I would be
able to walk again,

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I should never sell
my home, and shouldn't

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.220 align:middle line:90%
sell my practice, and so--

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're thinking about
when we're trapped in fear is

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
this statement-- what if,
followed by a negative

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:90%
statement, right?

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.480 align:middle line:90%
What if I lose respect?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.560 align:middle line:90%
What if people make fun of me?

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.297 align:middle line:90%
What if I fail?

00:32:55.297 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:84%
What if it's not as
good as I promise?

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's always what if, followed
by a negative statement.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And you have to teach people--

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.230 align:middle line:90%
well, first, pursue that.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.082 align:middle line:84%
Ask the question, and
really consider it.

00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:90%
What happens if those things?

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.732 align:middle line:90%
What's the worst-case scenario?

00:33:05.732 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to
teach them to flip it

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, what if, followed
by a positive statement.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't lose anything,
but you gain the things

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:90%
you really want in your life?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:84%
What if the process doesn't
terrorize you and make

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:90%
you awful?

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
What if you could
enjoy the process?

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
What if that process could
make you stronger and better

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and capable?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
What if, instead
of, oh, it's going

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to turn out terrible,
what if it turns out great

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and I finally get what
I've always wanted?

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Most anxiety, if it's not
a physiological problem

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:90%
or torment--

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:84%
it's really coming
from the mind.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
What if, followed by
a negative statement.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:84%
But if we start asking what
if these amazing things could

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:10%
Then we start to find hope.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:10%
We start to find willpower.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We start to find motivation.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.982 align:middle line:84%
We start to find a morning
that's brighter than yesterday.

00:33:54.982 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
need to get over the idea

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that fear is keeping them down.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is keeping you down.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Fear is just usually poor
management of our mind.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
the switch for me,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
because from that moment on,
my body started to respond

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.250 align:middle line:90%
to my mind very quickly.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was back on my feet in
a little less than 10 weeks.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:90%
I was back training at 12 weeks.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I really
have no pain in my spine,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and I just made a deal with
myself in those lonely nights.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought, if I'm ever
able to walk again,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I promise myself that I'll spend
the rest of my life studying

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:84%
the mind-body connection
and mind over matter,

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:52.172 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I've
been doing since 1986.

00:34:52.172 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole idea that belief
is controlling us is the most

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
important fact of science that
we're beginning to recognize

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:90%
for this simple reason--

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
a belief is connected
to chemistry.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry of the brain
is a translation of a belief.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the relevance is if
you have a negative belief,

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
then the chemistry that
comes from that brain

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be positive
and support your health.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going to put you
in a protection mode which,

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:84%
in fact, walls you
off from health.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to
recognize that,

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you start to see how
powerful belief is--

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:90%
it overrides the system--

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and how specific the belief is.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:90%


00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to let people know
how powerful they are,

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
because your thoughts
are going to take

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
whatever that belief
is and manifest it

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.290 align:middle line:90%
to become a reality.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you're
going to have cancer,

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
you can create cancer.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, less than 10% of
cancer is based on heredity.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.570 align:middle line:84%
90% of cancer is based
on lifestyle and belief.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:10%
>> I think most people don't
realize that thoughts are

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:10%
things, that they have
powerful impact on our biology

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.220 align:middle line:10%
and our lives.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:10%
And that how you direct
your attention and your mind

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:10%
determines the
course of your health

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:10%
and the course of your life.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:10%
>> We all have fear-based
limiting belief systems that

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.957 align:middle line:10%
have been ingrained in
us since childhood--

00:36:14.957 --> 00:36:16.540 align:middle line:10%
belief systems of
I'm not good enough,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.700 align:middle line:10%
or belief systems of
who am I to be great,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:10%
or who am I to earn money, or
how could I possibly do that

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.590 align:middle line:10%
thing I've been dreaming of?

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And these belief
systems are stifling us

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.275 align:middle line:84%
and keeping us small,
and blocking us

00:36:28.275 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:84%
from really living
in our highest

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
potential, in our
highest service,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and in our highest joy, truly.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So the first step to really
healing those belief systems

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:90%
is to witness them--

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to witness them without any
judgment, witness our judgment

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves without
judgment, and to be

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.370 align:middle line:84%
really conscious of what
are these belief systems?

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.668 align:middle line:90%
How are they making us feel?

00:36:47.668 --> 00:36:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We can ask ourselves
those questions.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.230 align:middle line:90%
What is my limiting belief?

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:90%
How is it making me feel?

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And then going so far to say,
what experience from my past

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
is causing me to
believe this now?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Because all of it comes
from a root cause condition.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a moment in time
when we separated from love.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we have that
experience of separation,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and then we continue to build up
a world that is a false belief

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.980 align:middle line:84%
system of fear, a false
belief system of inadequacy,

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.473 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of not
being good enough.

00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the other
most powerful ways that we can

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:84%
change limiting beliefs is
through finding evidence

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:90%
to the contrary--

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
so actively looking for
what else might be true.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.675 align:middle line:84%
In the example of limiting
money beliefs, well,

00:37:28.675 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:84%
if you're struggling with
money but other people aren't,

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:84%
recognizing, OK, well, maybe
they figured out something

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't yet,
so let me go collect

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:84%
all the evidence of
other people that

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.180 align:middle line:90%
disprove this limiting belief.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Could be the same
thing around health.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Actively-- proactively--
searching out and creating

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:84%
a whole stack of evidence
to the contrary is, I think,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:84%
how we can also start
to begin to change

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.572 align:middle line:90%
some of those negative beliefs.

00:37:52.572 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The word that's used in
science is called "mental

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:90%
rehearsal."

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And mental rehearsal-- there's
two types of mental rehearsal.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:84%
There's what's called
internal mental imaging, which

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:84%
means you're in the scene as the
first person experiencing it,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and then there's called
external mental imaging,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.850 align:middle line:84%
which is you're observing
yourself in the scene.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that when
you are actually

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:84%
in the first person and
not the third person,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that action of rehearsing
what you're doing

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:84%
produces this strong
biological change.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's been some
really cool studies with

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.970 align:middle line:90%
visualization.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an Australian
researcher, Alan Richardson,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:84%
who took three groups
of basketball players.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
One group did free throws for 20
minutes every day for 20 days.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:84%
One group imagined doing three
throws for 20 minutes every day

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.940 align:middle line:90%
for 20 days.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And another group did nothing.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So the group that
did free throws

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.327 align:middle line:90%
every day got 24% better.

00:38:52.327 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The group that didn't,
they didn't get any better.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
The group that imagined
doing free throws

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
got 23% better,
just by imagining.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
They didn't shoot a single
hoop, and they got 23% better.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> So what's the relevance?

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, when
you're truly focused

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're truly
paying attention,

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
your brain does not
know the difference

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:84%
between what's
going on out there

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in
here, so the thought becomes

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.360 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, from a
biological standpoint,

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:84%
our brains are a
record of the past.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
They're an artifact
of everything

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:84%
we've learned and
experienced to this moment.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:84%
When we prime the brain
to change its circuitry

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:84%
before the experience,
now the brain

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is no longer a
record of the past.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:90%
It's now a map to the future.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.900 align:middle line:10%
And so as we warm up those brain
circuits, it's more easy for us

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.790 align:middle line:10%
to slip into a
supernatural behavior.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:10%
>> So for example,
Roger Bannister--

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.810 align:middle line:10%
what did Roger
Bannister do in 1954?

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:90%
He broke the four-minute mile.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.907 align:middle line:84%
Throughout human history, no one
could run a mile less than four

00:39:54.907 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:84%
minutes, because
the belief back then

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
was the human heart
wasn't able to sustain

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.930 align:middle line:84%
a sub-four-minute mile, it
would explode in your chest,

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and you would die.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do it now?

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, lengthening
his amazing stride,

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:90%
this was Venice [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Watch his final
300-yard dash, first

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
passing Chataway,
then on, battling

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
against unfavorable conditions,
a crosswind and a sudden track.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But the interesting thing
was he would actually visualize

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
himself crossing the finish
line, and in his mind,

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:84%
he would see the clock,
and it says 3:59,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:84%
because he knows that it has
to happen in here before it

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.873 align:middle line:90%
happens out there.

00:40:30.873 --> 00:40:32.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, that was an
interesting part.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:10%
But the other part that
I found interesting

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:10%
was what happened after that.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Nobody can run a sub-four-minute
mile, all of a sudden,

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:10%
one person does it.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:84%
What happens over
the next few years?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Dozens and dozens
of people start

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:90%
running a sub-four-minute mile.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, was there a big advancement
in shoe technology, training

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.620 align:middle line:10%
methodology, nutritional
supplementation?

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.420 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.510 align:middle line:10%
Where was the change?

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.877 align:middle line:10%
A change in belief, because
all of a sudden, one person

00:40:52.877 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:10%
could do it, then it gave
permission for everybody else.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.790 align:middle line:10%
It shook up that
limiting belief.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>> It's going to be very close--

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Nine-time gold medal swimmer
Carl Lewis uses visualization.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Tiger Woods, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Muhammad Ali,

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
tennis legend Billie Jean
King, Michael Jordan--

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.720 align:middle line:84%
all the greats in
every area of sport,

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:90%
they all use visualization.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Tiger Woods' father taught
him how to use visualization.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:84%
He says that every time
before he hits the ball,

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.097 align:middle line:84%
he visualizes where
he wants it to go.

00:41:22.097 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:10%
Arnold Schwarzenegger--
when he was a bodybuilder,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:10%
he visualized
himself up on stage

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:10%
winning the Mr. Olympia,
the Mr. Universe.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:10%
When he was an actor, he
visualized being an actor

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:10%
and just crushing it.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:10%
When he was in
politics, he used it.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.727 align:middle line:84%
In everything he did,
he used visualization,

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's why he's always
been successful at the things

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
that he's been focused on--
because he's using his power.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There's the
story of Jim Carrey,

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.280 align:middle line:84%
where he was a starving
actor, and he wrote a check

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:90%
for himself for $10 million.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:84%
He dated it three
years in the future,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and said, for acting
services rendered.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, he got
a check for $10 million

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:84%
for the movie
"Dumb and Dumber--"

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:90%
exactly three years to the day.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.503 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, manifesting is all
about aligning with the energy

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.600 align:middle line:90%
of joy.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So if a visualization
makes you feel good,

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.850 align:middle line:90%
then you're manifesting.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.210 align:middle line:84%
If visualizing something that
you don't have doesn't make you

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:84%
feel good-- makes you feel
lack or insecurity or as though

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.150 align:middle line:90%
something's missing--

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
then that wouldn't
be the tool to use,

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
about feeling good.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's why visualization
works for so many people--

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:90%
because holding that image--

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that makes you ignite a feeling.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's that feeling
that is magnetic.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It's that feeling that puts
you into alignment with God,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:90%
with the universe, with source.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:84%
In that space of
alignment, you become

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.810 align:middle line:90%
what I call a super attractor.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:58.203 align:middle line:84%
You start to magnetize
towards you what you desire,

00:42:58.203 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and you start to become
a match for the things

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.320 align:middle line:90%
that you think about--

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
but as long as you're
in a presence of joy.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
You're a match for the things
you think about even when

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.310 align:middle line:84%
you're not in the
presence of joy,

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but those are things
you don't want.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So if it's visualization
that makes you feel good

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and it empowers you and
it lights you up to see--

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I visualized myself sitting next
to Oprah Winfrey for a decade

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:90%
before I did, right?

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:90%
But it made me feel good.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the feeling of
being interviewed by Oprah,

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
or holding that baby in your
arms, or having that abundance.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.448 align:middle line:84%
So making sure that
that feels good.

00:43:30.448 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything about
that visualization that

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't feel good, then we
want to find another tool.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So visualization is using
the language of symbols.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And to me, symbols
are the universal form

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.535 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
communicate with someone

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't speak
your language,

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.450 align:middle line:90%
you're going to use symbols.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
just landed in China

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and you want to know
where the bathroom is,

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
look for a symbol.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You're going to look for
the symbol of the men's

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.280 align:middle line:84%
room or the women's
room, and that's

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:84%
how you know where
the bathroom is.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.073 align:middle line:84%
That's how you communicate
with someone that

00:43:57.073 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:90%
doesn't speak your language.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about the body--

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:middle line:84%
we see the body mostly as
a machine, but the body

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:90%
isn't really a machine.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.513 align:middle line:84%
The body is living
consciousness.

00:44:05.513 --> 00:44:07.430 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
to communicate with it.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't speak English.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.873 align:middle line:84%
We can't say to it, I
want to lose weight,

00:44:10.873 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
because in six months, I want
to look good for my wedding.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:14.580 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't
understand a wedding.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.525 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand
six months.

00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:16.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't understand English.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:18.562 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
problems that we all

00:44:18.562 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:84%
have that we don't
even know we have is we

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to communicate
with our own animal

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.280 align:middle line:84%
brain, our own physical,
consciousness brain.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you use symbols,
you're bridging that gap.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a vivid
image of exactly the way

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.130 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to look, or
if you're doing sports,

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.830 align:middle line:84%
a vivid image of exactly
the way you'd like your body

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:40.470 align:middle line:84%
to perform, you're
communicating to your body,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and all the changes are taking
place-- the neuronal changes,

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:90%
the hormonal changes.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything is changing
because you've now

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.210 align:middle line:84%
been able to communicate
with your body.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, I decided
to apply visualization

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:90%
to my weight loss.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I did,
everything changed.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I was over 400 pounds.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a vivid image of
how I wanted to look.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I imagined myself with tight
skin and stomach muscles,

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:90%
and looking great.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And every night, as I went to
sleep, I'd have this image,

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.313 align:middle line:90%
and things started to change.

00:45:10.313 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't as hungry
during the day.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't craving junk food.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I started finding people that
could help me, and programs.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything started
to work after that.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And over a 2 and
1/2 year period,

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:10%
I lost all the
weight that I gained.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:10%
I lost 220 pounds, and
I looked exactly the way

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.448 align:middle line:10%
I had imagined myself
looking, down to a T,

00:45:30.448 --> 00:45:32.240 align:middle line:10%
and that's why
visualization's so powerful.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Visualization is a
huge contributor to a lot

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of the success I've
had in my life.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Becoming a four-time free
diving world champion,

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I realized that you didn't
have a big impact, because it's

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:90%
a very small sport.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important message

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:84%
from my free diving records is
the fact that it's a metaphor.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor for
a huge challenge.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You were told, you have
doubt, you're tired,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.330 align:middle line:84%
your body is going crazy,
because you can't breathe.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.100 align:middle line:84%
You go against the
strongest reflex

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.080 align:middle line:90%
of life, which is breathing.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Without stress,
there is no life.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So meaning that
without resistance,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
without difficulties,
there is no growth.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Did 250 feet under ice
in Speedos, and in that,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I reached my goal of getting
the message out that breathing,

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:84%
breath work, and linking
that with your mind really

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:84%
can have a tremendous impact
on both your performance,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.225 align:middle line:90%
but also your daily health.

00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:47.553 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.553 --> 00:46:49.470 align:middle line:84%
When you know how to
control your mind and use

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.600 align:middle line:84%
visualization--
imagery, breath work,

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
eating healthy,
surrounding yourself

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.193 align:middle line:84%
with people that believe
in you and support you,

00:46:56.193 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you can take it
to the next level.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.687 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.687 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:84%
The most difficult thing
about holding your breath

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is not lacking oxygen, but
to fight the urge to breathe.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Being uncomfortable
in life doesn't

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
mean that you can't
succeed, so the metaphor

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:middle line:84%
is to show people that there is
light at the end of the tunnel,

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.887 align:middle line:84%
Literally, when I
dive under the ice,

00:47:20.887 --> 00:47:22.720 align:middle line:84%
you're there, but then
the light shines down

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from that hole 250 feet ahead
of you, and it welcomes you.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.965 align:middle line:84%
A big part of my job is to
break those limiting beliefs.

00:47:35.965 --> 00:47:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's
what it's all about.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:39.007 align:middle line:84%
When you want to
break limits, you

00:47:39.007 --> 00:47:41.340 align:middle line:84%
want to change the
mindset of people--

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:43.735 align:middle line:84%
scientists or athletes
or everyday people,

00:47:43.735 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:84%
you want to change
their mindset.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.610 align:middle line:84%
For me, holding my breath
for 22 minutes was a dream.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:54.280 align:middle line:90%
It was fantasy.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So before I do that, I
become the 22 minutes.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:05.480 align:middle line:84%
If I'm like, maybe it
can happen someday, or--

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It will not happen.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Until my subconscious
mind accepts

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.670 align:middle line:90%
that it will become a reality--

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.590 align:middle line:90%
a physical reality--

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I cannot manifest this
dream I have in real life.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> 6, 7, 8, 9, 22 minutes.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I do my dives
or my performances,

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.660 align:middle line:84%
it's just a manifestation of
a long journey, of a dream.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.630 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And for all the dives I do
and all the visualization,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:84%
all the work I do, I always
connect it with breath work,

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:49.820 align:middle line:84%
because then you have
doubled up on the efficiency.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:84%
When you link the breathing
to all the positive

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.280 align:middle line:84%
reinforcement-- all the
happy thoughts, basically,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.260 align:middle line:90%
all the winning thoughts--

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.560 align:middle line:84%
then every time you breathe
on a more conscious level,

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.770 align:middle line:84%
you ignite that
power of possibility.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And especially when the
breathing becomes, also,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.310 align:middle line:84%
on the subconscious
level, so strong that it

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.760 align:middle line:84%
leads your movements,
it leads your thoughts

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.030 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So as kids, we are
normally in this deep state--

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.260 align:middle line:84%
a dream state, this alpha
and the theta state.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.525 align:middle line:90%
We get into it really easy.

00:49:23.525 --> 00:49:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we unlearn that,
because our teacher says,

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.290 align:middle line:90%
stop dreaming, stay focused.

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:middle line:90%
So we lose that.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of literature, culture,
art was created in dream

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:10%
states.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:10%
So for example, Mary Shelley
came up with Frankenstein

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.250 align:middle line:10%
in her dreams.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney came up with
"Yesterday" in his dream.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Elias Howe created the
sewing machine in his dream.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:10%
The periodic table came
to a chemist in his dream.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.888 align:middle line:84%
So many times, you'll
come up with answers,

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll come up with
solutions, you'll

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.132 align:middle line:84%
come up with inventions,
works of art, in your dreams.

00:49:56.132 --> 00:49:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Learning how to get back
into that dream state is the key

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.858 align:middle line:84%
to being successful
in visualization.

00:50:05.858 --> 00:50:07.275 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
in visualization

00:50:07.275 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:84%
is you want to know
how to relax yourself.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:14.522 align:middle line:84%
So you can breathe deep, do
just a simple meditation.

00:50:14.522 --> 00:50:16.855 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, you're
going to feel really relaxed,

00:50:16.855 --> 00:50:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
fidgeting anymore.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Then you're in a deeper state.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're not-- your
mind's not fidgeting either.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the time to
do visualization.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it
then, it just imprints.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.460 align:middle line:90%
You just get it.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.255 align:middle line:84%
So then you want to
imagine, or feel.

00:50:30.255 --> 00:50:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily--
you don't have to see it--

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.463 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times when you
first learn visualization,

00:50:34.463 --> 00:50:35.915 align:middle line:90%
you can't see it.

00:50:35.915 --> 00:50:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a skill that you get
better and better at over time.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:90%
But you can feel it.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You can feel what it feels to
run faster than the other guy,

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:84%
or to have the weight
melting off of your body,

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.787 align:middle line:84%
or achieve whatever
athletic performance.

00:50:47.787 --> 00:50:49.120 align:middle line:90%
You can feel what it feels like.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.250 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the crowd shouting.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:54.040 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the wind on your
face as you're running by.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
different things.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.015 align:middle line:84%
When an athlete does
visualization, the muscles,

00:51:01.015 --> 00:51:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the neurons, nerves--
they're all firing

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.550 align:middle line:84%
in the exact same, coordinated
sequence as you're actually

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.530 align:middle line:90%
doing the sport.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:13.780 align:middle line:84%
To me, visualization is the
creative principle of life.

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
just all lost that.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.730 align:middle line:10%
I think in indigenous
cultures all around the world,

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:19.590 align:middle line:10%
they all use visualization.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.140 align:middle line:10%
And as a kid, we used dream.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We used imagination.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
We used that creative faculty.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is the
creative faculty of life.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It is the way to set the
dials of the automatic pilot

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:33.863 align:middle line:90%
if you're in a plane.

00:51:33.863 --> 00:51:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like setting the
dials of your life

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.347 align:middle line:84%
when you visualize
where you want to be.

00:51:37.347 --> 00:51:39.930 align:middle line:84%
You're the dials down when you
visualize how you want your day

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to be, how you want
to perform in sports,

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.585 align:middle line:90%
how healthy you want to be.

00:51:42.585 --> 00:51:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You're using that
creative principle.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.120 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
We haven't tapped into
that, but it's ours.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.813 align:middle line:84%
We lost it somewhere
along the way,

00:51:48.813 --> 00:51:49.980 align:middle line:90%
but it belongs to all of us.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:52:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I compare your
life to an egg--

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that if an egg is broken by
an outside force, life ends.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But if it's broken by an
inside force, life begins.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:84%
All great things
begin on the inside.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.210 align:middle line:90%
You have genius inside of you.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
You have greatness
inside of you.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.457 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time to unlock it.

00:52:21.457 --> 00:52:23.693 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.693 --> 00:52:25.360 align:middle line:84%
[MUSIC - NICK BROADHURST,
 "ALWAYS YOU"]

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.820 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Going back to
where the story all began,

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:36.100 align:middle line:84%
do you want to hear the
journey of this man?

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:42.222 align:middle line:84%
Some maybe, maybe, you're
gonna call me crazy, a feeling,

00:52:42.222 --> 00:52:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I know it can't be wrong.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:10%
So one day, you're
gonna be my lover.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.551 align:middle line:10%
Everybody run for cover.

00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:56.768 align:middle line:10%
The ceiling's coming down.

00:52:56.768 --> 00:53:00.720 align:middle line:10%
And one day, we're
gonna be forever.

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.006 align:middle line:10%
Everybody said we'd never.

00:53:03.006 --> 00:53:07.275 align:middle line:90%
The ceiling's coming down.

Don't run, I'm gonna
be there for you now.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:38.401 align:middle line:10%
I'll walk you through the
sunshine and the rain.

00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:43.331 align:middle line:10%
I believe that second
chances come again.

00:53:43.331 --> 00:53:49.247 align:middle line:10%
So maybe, maybe, no
longer call us crazy.

00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:53.684 align:middle line:10%
A feeling, I know
it wasn't wrong.

00:53:53.684 --> 00:53:58.650 align:middle line:84%
