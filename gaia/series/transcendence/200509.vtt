As a child, you have no control

So you're born into
this environment.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And pretty quickly, the giants
in your world, the adults,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
look at you and say, all
right, little boy, now we

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
want you to put this
thing on or else.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And they hand you this mask.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
For women, it will be

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
You'll learn pretty quickly
that this mask comes with it

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
a set of expectations around
your behavior, around things

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll say, around things you're
allowed to think and not think,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and the consequences for when
you take it off and speak

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:90%
your mind as a child.

saying things, being
curious about things

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:10%
that you're not supposed
to be curious about.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.478 align:middle line:10%
What you realize as a
young person is that when

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:25.395 align:middle line:10%
you start to see that mask
off, justice is swift.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:10%
The mask then comes
with its own penal code.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:10%
If you take it off, here are
the escalating levels of voltage

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:10%
that will be applied
to you to get you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:10%
to put the damn thing back on.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:10%
As a child, if nobody pulls
you aside to explain all this,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:10%
kids are not stupid.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:10%

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
For most kids who are
thinking about it, which

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.190 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much all kids,
they will conclude, and not

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
unreasonably so, that
if I take this mask off,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:90%
I will lose love.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:10%
I will not be worthy of love.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:10%
I will not be a good person,
and the message for many people

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:10%
is, you won't deserve love.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Which means, don't expect
love from anyone around you,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.065 align:middle line:84%
but also, if you intrinsically
don't deserve love,

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't even
love yourself.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The issue that often happens
is that because you're being

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
asked to put this mask on--

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're my child, I may
enforce it pretty strictly, but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
because I want to protect you.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to get
beaten up in the schoolyard

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:90%
after school.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
to be ostracized.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have prestige
and money and all the things

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
you want in this world, and
that requires the participation

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation and even
adulation of people around you.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And you need to put a
certain kind of mask on.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But where the wound comes
in then is where, as a kid,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
you're like, every time
I take this thing off,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I get cattle-prodded, hard.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So it must mean that they
want me to put this on.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to the
little six-year-old

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.598 align:middle line:84%
or the parents around
him could be perfectly

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
willing to die for them, take
a bullet for them, or whatever,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know that as
a kid because you've never

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
held your own little
newborn in your arm.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So for you as a kid,
you're like, well,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.427 align:middle line:84%
it feels like I'm
losing love when

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't get to have dessert,
when I get sent to my room,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
when I get like
physically punished,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
it feels like I'm
not with loved.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.728 align:middle line:84%
So in the absence of an elder
pulling them aside to say,

00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
look, your loved without
condition, period.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
We would all-- any of us
here would die for you.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, they
don't pull their kids aside

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to explain that because it
was never explained to them.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They're still running
for their lives,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
thinking I need to sort of
make my revenue this quarter

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
or I will not deserve love
even from my own self.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
That's a great motivator.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:90%
It's great for earnings.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's great for
your bank account.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's great for a lot of things.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I am
against any economic growth

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and thriving or
whatever, but it's just

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.145 align:middle line:90%
a question of the cost.

00:04:41.145 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
To have that sort of
fear hanging over you

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and have that be the reason you
are so productive in your life,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:90%
that to me is too high a cost.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even an issue
of the practical cost.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that it
isn't actually true.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
No matter how bad your dad was,
how harsh he was, at the end

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
of the day, he would
give his life for you.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
No normal healthy person
isn't willing at a snap

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to give their life
for their child.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Whales will do that.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Mother bears will do that.

You don't even have
to be a mammal.

00:05:29.238 --> 00:05:31.228 align:middle line:90%
Chickens will do that.

We're wired for protection
of our offspring.

00:05:35.163 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that

But very rare as a

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.535 align:middle line:84%
pulls them aside to
kind of like shop

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
talk all this through,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
so there's nothing
wrong with you.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep the
mask on out of fear,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the problem
comes because you're keeping it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
on based on a false
pretense, which is

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:90%

at the end of the day,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
what does your child
do when they see you?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in every
country around the world

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%

they run to me.

And I say, and
what did they want?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:90%
They want three things--

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
they want affection,
attention, and acknowledgment.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:10%

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:10%

Why do I have to go to school?

Why am I getting criticized?

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I live up to
my parents' expectations?

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Why are my parents always

When you're little,
parents are people.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is women.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Your father is men.

Or if you have same-sex parents,
that's just the way it is.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%

Why are my parents struggling?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.755 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess money is

Well, there they are.

They're struggling again.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Boy, it really looks like money
is scarce and hard to get.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:10%
And at some point, you
start believing it.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:10%
A belief is a
statement about reality

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:10%
that you believe is the truth.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's just what a belief is.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe people
can't be trusted,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
or I believe people
are good at heart.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Those are beliefs.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:10%
The source of the
beliefs went back

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:10%
to early stages of parenting.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:10%
If children were criticized
heavily, they would conclude,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm not good enough.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't given love and
affection, they would conclude,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess I'm
not worth loving.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
If they were ignored or
weren't given enough attention,

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
they would conclude,
I'm not important.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
We think that we see our
beliefs in the world.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So something happens,
we get criticized,

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and we give it the meaning, oh,
I guess I'm not good enough.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
criticized again,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.752 align:middle line:84%
and we go, yeah,
I'm not good enough.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the third time
we give it the meaning,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:90%
the meaning becomes a belief.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.843 align:middle line:90%
Now I have a belief.

00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
When I ask this
question to people

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.052 align:middle line:84%
from every country in
the world, and I say,

00:08:36.052 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it seem like you
saw, I'm not good enough.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And they say,
well, I did see it.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And I say, really?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Can you see my scarf?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:90%
They say yes.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a color,
shape, and location?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Does "I'm not good enough" have
a color, shape, and location?

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't see I'm not good--

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
but before we do
that they say, well,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
but I saw my father
criticize me,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and I saw I didn't
get A's in school,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and I saw my mother tell
me that I would never

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
amount to anything, or
all the wonderful things

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people
say to children.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I saw I wasn't important.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You saw your parents busy
working all the time,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
not being at home, not
paying attention to you.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
That's seeable, but you
cannot see a belief.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's how
beliefs get formed.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, why did they run our lives?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
that water is hot,

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
are you going to put
your finger in it?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
If you believe, I don't
deserve good things,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
are you going to ask
for what you want?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
If you believe,
I'm not important,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.635 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
sit in a meeting,

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and the little
voice in your head

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
is going to go, yeah, no,
they probably know this.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Or nobody cares what
you have to say,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and that voice comes
from your beliefs

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
until you don't speak up.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:90%

did you believe in Santa Claus

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and the Easter Bunny?

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:90%
You did, right?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you grew up, and you
went, oh, that's not real.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Let me have a new belief.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe now I
believe in hard work

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
again, earning my way
through the world.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
being willing to become

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:90%
an emotionally mature adult.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:90%
My parents didn't get along.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
They hated each other.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
The mantra I heard out of my
mother's mouth forever was,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%
"All men are idiots."

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:90%
That was what I grew up with--

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:90%
"All men are idiots."

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I grew up to
discover that's not true.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But for the early
years of my dating,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:52.782 align:middle line:84%
I lived like all
men were idiots,

00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and then I started to
say, wait, I'm not really

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:90%
having a lot of fun here.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, that guy
graduated from Harvard Law

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
He is not an idiot.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I need to change.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be willing to
look at our belief systems

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and question them and do what
my old friend Wayne Dyer always

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:90%
said--

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.895 align:middle line:84%
"Don't believe every

>> Self-esteem
comes from yourself.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It comes from
esteeming yourself.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We think our self-esteem
comes from outside of us.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have what we call
"survival strategy beliefs."

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is being successful.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.945 align:middle line:84%
By successful, I mean
achieving things.

00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:90%

are here.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Number one belief, I have
never worked with anybody

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't have it.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not good enough.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is achieving things?

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
That's workaholism right there.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
The second belief,
I'm not important.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
What makes me important
is being successful.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Having a lot of money,
achieving things.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I'm doing
it, this beach ball called,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
"I'm not good enough, I'm not
important," stays underwater.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's a driven behavior.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call them
survival strategy beliefs.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So you think your self-esteem--

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
because this is underwater--

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.387 align:middle line:90%
is now intact.

00:12:39.387 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And people say to
me, oh, I don't have

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:90%
the belief I'm not good enough.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
I say, really?

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:90%
What makes you good enough?

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And if they answer anything
other than nothing,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I just am, they have a belief.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It's very elegant in
the way we look at it.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So the first beliefs
are, I'm not good enough,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not important,
mistakes and failures

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
are bad, if I make a mistake
or fail, I'll be rejected.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four
most common beliefs.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:21.055 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem beliefs are, I'm
not worthy, I'm inadequate,

00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:21.855 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable.

00:13:21.855 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me say something
very important here--

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:90%
my mother was an angel.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:90%
She was love on legs.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
If you came into her space, you
got love, whether you wanted it

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
That's who she was.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So when I was little, she
did everything for me.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'll do it [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it, sweetheart.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
This was, of course,
a Jewish mother.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.358 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it, sweetheart.

00:13:49.358 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't stand to
see me struggle.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Guess what I concluded?

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't come
from bad parenting.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You could love
your child to death

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.728 align:middle line:84%
and do things that
don't serve them.

that I use is,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
a father comes down and
Johnny's about to go to school

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and choose whatever college
he's about to go after.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And his father
disdains parents that

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.417 align:middle line:90%
put their kids under pressure.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:10%
And he turns to Johnny
and says, Johnny, you

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:10%
can do whatever you
want with your life,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:10%
and mom and myself will
be so proud of you.

grandfather was a postman.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But you go do whatever
you want to do.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Johnny goes to school that
day wishing and praying

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and dreaming about
being a pilot.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually he yearns
the love of his father

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and the approval of his father,
and he's haunted by the fact

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that his father has gifted
him this idea that really,

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
if you want me to love you
and accept you beyond measure,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
you should be a postman.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't say that.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the unspoken expectations.

And when you delve into
that, when you were parented,

somebody does something wrong,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.975 align:middle line:84%
they deserve to be punished,
and the way to be punished

00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is to be beaten, because that's

it the meaning--

comes from Shelly Lefkoe.

And Shelly said, your
only job as a parent

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
is to keep your children safe.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:90%
It's to keep your children safe.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
To teach them how to cross
the street, to teach them

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:90%
how to protect themselves.

And the second rule is, let
your kids be who they are.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Do not impose your
beliefs on your children.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Your job as a parent is
to keep your children

religion on your children.

Let them decide if they
want it themselves.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Your job, according
to Shefali and

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:90%
according to Shelly Lefkoe--

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:84%
two of the greatest
parenting minds out there--

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure that you
do not infect your children

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:90%
with your beliefs.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But to let them form
their own beliefs

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and to ensure that those
beliefs are healthy.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things we
have to recognize as parents

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
is that every little
thing we do is going

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to cause our children to take
on some belief or the other,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
just like every little
thing our parents did

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:90%
imposed the belief onto us.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And that really is one
of the ultimate skills

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:90%
you want to learn as a parent.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Rule number one,
keep your kids safe.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Rule number two, do not impose
your beliefs on the kid.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Rule number three, keep
your kids safe from damaging

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.595 align:middle line:84%

on based on your behavior.

that the world is

is if you don't hit
your child, your child

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
will never believe that violence
is the way to handle things.

Inside the belief that violence
is a way to handle things,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of possible
actions you could take--

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Go first.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:90%
What have you got to lose?

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Say sorry.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Say, I'm wrong.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Say, I'm scared.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Say, I don't know.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:10%
The three most beautiful
words that every parent

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:10%
should have every single day
in front of their children--

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, son.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Allow your kids to see
your humanity so that they

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:90%
begin to recognize their own.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.248 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:30.248 --> 00:23:42.698 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.698 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The self negative inner
critic force will typically

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
come at you across
four channels,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and the four are
competence, body, identity,

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and relationship.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Competence is the idea that you
should be better at something

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:90%
than you actually are.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:10%
So it could be your
grades, how much money

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:10%
you make, prestige, popularity,
sociability, cooking,

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:10%
skill as a lover,
any of these things.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:10%
But generally, it's something
that has to do with competence.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You have some power over it.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
It is a skill.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It is something you can
work on theoretically.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first one.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:10%
The second one is body,
which is this feeling

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:10%
that there's something
intrinsically

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:10%
wrong with your body.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
That you're either too
fat or too thin, too tall

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:84%
or too short, the wrong body
shape, the wrong body color,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
features too big,
your nose, your ears.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It could be you're too
hairy or not hairy enough.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Basically this idea
that there's just

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with
my body that, again,

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:90%
makes me not worthy of love.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.883 align:middle line:84%
The third is identity,
which is the idea there

00:24:38.883 --> 00:24:40.300 align:middle line:84%
is there's something
intrinsically

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
wrong with something
about you as a person

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're basically
not going to change.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So it could be your gender.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It could be your
ethnicity it could

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:90%
be your religious affiliation.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It could even be
your personality.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Or it's like I'm intrinsically
kind of an introvert,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a sales guy
or an executive,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
so I'm expected to play golf
and like do all these things.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So I do them
begrudgingly, but I feel

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
like there's something
wrong with me

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.615 align:middle line:84%
because I actually
like sitting at home

00:25:03.615 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and just reading a book.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The fourth is a little
bit in its own category,

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
call relationship.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
idea that you have

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
this core belief in your
mind that I will only

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:90%
be worthy of love if blank.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I will only be lovable and
worthy of love if blank.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.065 align:middle line:84%
And this blank
conflates beautifully

00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:90%
with the first three.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I will only be lovable if I'm
competent, if I make money,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
if I'm rich, if I'm smart,
if I get good grades, if I

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
score a lot of goals on the
athletic field, if I'm popular.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Or body-- I'll only be
lovable if I'm tall,

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
if I'm hot, if I'm skinny, if
I've got a full head of hair,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Identity-- I'll only
be lovable if I'm not

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:84%
the gender I am because boys are
more valuable than girls right.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Siblings talk about
this all the time.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a different
ethnicity, if I'm

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
a different religion, if I'm
a different personality type.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The poison is not from
what you put in the blank.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:90%
That's irrelevant.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.706 align:middle line:90%
The poison is in the if.

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
The if is what implies that
before you've done anything--

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:84%
before we've turned
over any cards

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.187 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what you're
actually going to do

00:26:23.187 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:84%
or even what you want to
do that you as you are

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
with no additional
bells and whistles

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
are intrinsically unworthy
of love, and it's not true.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has all four.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And the trick is that
the four elements

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
are blended into a unique
smoothie for each person.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.170 align:middle line:84%
The mix of competence,
body, identity, relationship

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.363 align:middle line:84%
is different, and the flavor
of each one is different.

00:26:50.363 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you have one
of these smoothies,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.670 align:middle line:84%
you're sipping it all day long,
whether you like to or not.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:90%
The voice is in you.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like you see somebody
drive a nice car by,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're like oh my
gosh, I feel like an idiot.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Or you're a mom taking
your kids to school.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And this other mom
brings her kids in too.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.277 align:middle line:84%

her daughters are

all brushed and perfectly fine.

00:27:08.718 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel like
your daughter's hair

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is like a rat's nest.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And the inner voice just
starts to eat you alive.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when you say
these things to yourself

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:90%
constantly, with the upshot--

And because it
hurts, It's a wound.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
When you have a wound, there's
two very natural things you do.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a Roman gladiator in
the arena and we're fighting

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.333 align:middle line:84%
and you cut my chest a little,
I'm going to do two things.

00:27:38.333 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
First thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to shield--

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:90%
don't hit me again.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is that
behind the safety of my shield,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I will try to grab something
to make the pain less.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:90%
So I will soothe.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
humans that do this.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:10%
Earthworms do this.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.908 align:middle line:10%
If I poke an earthworm, it will
start to move away from me.

00:27:53.908 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
wrong with a person when

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
they show their shield,
just like there's

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with
a person when they

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
have this fore
wound because they

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.457 align:middle line:90%
were told to put on a mask.

00:28:01.457 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.415 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with any of this.

00:28:04.415 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just when it
happens in a certain way,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
it causes more pain
than it requires.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
If you zoom in on
a shielding, there

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%
are a couple of usual suspects.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%
The first is money and prestige.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Can't argue with
success, especially

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:90%
here in Silicon Valley.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
If I POed my company for
half a billion dollars

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and now I've got a checkbook
funding all these profits,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
no one is going
to poke my wound.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.378 align:middle line:84%
It's this auto drone
century mode shield,

00:28:36.378 --> 00:28:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and no one is going
to poke my wound.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:10%
As long as I know everyone
in the room knows who I am

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:10%
and what I've done, which is why
people with prestige and money

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:10%
will often make
sure you know that.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Perfectionism is another, where
if I'm perfect in every way--

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:10%
perfect body, perfect spouse,
perfect house, perfect kids--

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:10%
put together in
exactly the right way,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.470 align:middle line:10%
doing all the right activities,
the right kind of job,

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:10%
the right kind of
volunteer, kids

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
doing the right
thing, everything,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:10%
if I'm perfect in every
way, then that is hopefully

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:10%
an impenetrable shield
where no arrow of criticism

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.877 align:middle line:10%
can get through.

00:29:11.877 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And the issue, of course,
with perfectionism

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
is that it's exhausting
and it's impossible.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Third one is anger.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:10%
So if I'm angry all
the time and I've

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:10%
got a scowl and people
know to walk on eggshells,

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:10%
that keeps everyone
at a distance,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:10%
and that's functionally
what I want.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do come
in to swing at me,

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm already out of range.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's also very effective.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But again, the cost is that
it estranges my relationships,

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and I have no warmth in my life.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The last two are invisibility
and people pleasing.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So invisibility as a shield is
if I keep my head down, dress

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:84%
very plainly, don't raise
my hand, speak up in class,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
don't speak up in
business meetings,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe the bullies will
not notice me and not

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:84%
pull me out to shame me or
ridicule me in some way.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And the shield of
people pleasing

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is that if everyone
around me is happy--

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
happy with me--

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.592 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps the bullies
will give me a pass.

00:30:05.592 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with these last two

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.192 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
not actual shields.

00:30:09.192 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't actually
block anything.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Invisibility, you're
not blocking anything.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you're not
an iguana, so I can see you.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're trying to
sort of evade attention.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with people pleasing

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not
a shield either.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't block.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It's appeasement.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.285 align:middle line:84%
So in the classroom,
it's the class clown.

00:30:29.285 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And in real life,
it's the parent

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that is like serving everybody
in the upper generation,

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
the in-laws, everyone
in the lower generation.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Serving the spouse,
serving the workplace,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.022 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing left for me.

00:30:43.022 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And you do this because
you feel like you

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
have to do this or else
you will lose love and not

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:90%
be worthy of love.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So you'll give
anything for that.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's shielding.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just a menu of options.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Everyone comes up
with their own mix.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They use different
things in different--

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
If you have a wound, and
we all do, you will shield.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.852 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach
is not an exercise

00:31:08.852 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
in like how do we get
you to shield less.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, no, no,
you keep that thing up.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't want you to get hit.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's more a question
of just making sure you're

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:90%
getting value for money.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
If I'm laying out all
this blood and treasure

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to keep the shield
up, I want it to work.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And soothing is similar.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Soothing is-- the usual suspects
are alcohol and substances,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.300 align:middle line:84%
just the chemical brute
force of hitting the voice

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to shut it up.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It's sex and relationships.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So sex as like the physical act,
just the narcotic act of sex.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But also relationships,
which is like the surge

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
of emotional validation you
get like the first two or three

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:90%
weeks in any relationship.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.795 align:middle line:10%
Then after that, you kind of
see each other more clearly,

00:31:53.795 --> 00:31:55.170 align:middle line:10%
and you say ah,
and you run away.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.045 align:middle line:90%
And it's very common.

00:31:56.045 --> 00:31:57.430 align:middle line:90%
People do it all the time.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And then others on the
soothing-- texting, gaming,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:90%
shopping, gossiping, Netflix.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is not how do
we get you to not soothe.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:90%
You will soothe.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only question
is, how do you

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.900 align:middle line:84%
want to soothe to
get the maximal pain

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:90%
relief for the least cost?

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
When you realize this entire
range of things-- everything

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:25.030 align:middle line:84%
from sex, drugs,
heroin, binge drinking,

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to like Netflix
and stupid games on your phone,

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
once you realize this full
rogue's gallery of soothings

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
are all aimed at numbing
a single wound within you

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that you as you are
intrinsically unworthy of love.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Holy cow.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
If they're all aiming
at the same thing,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:84%
then that means they're
interchangeable.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Any soothing will do.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.548 align:middle line:90%

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:10%

a negative emotion,

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:10%
I can't react powerfully

You can get rid of

Let me give you a
parenting example.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%
My kid just mouthed off at me.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:90%
They mouthed off at me is here.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me is here.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Meaning is never
inherent in the events.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Meaning is in your mind.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you get that the meaning
is separate from the event,

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the emotion will go away.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:84%
You can also look at it and
say, what just happened?

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:90%
My teenager mouthed off at me.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:90%
What else could it mean?

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It could mean they are a
hormonal teenager having

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:90%
a rough day.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, take it the last step.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
What does it really mean that
they just spoke to me that way?

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And another way of saying
that is, what do I know

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.429 align:middle line:90%
for sure because that happened?

00:35:00.272 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you're going to give it the
meaning, oh god, I'm a failure,

I'm a loser, I'm terrible.

mistakes and failures

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:84%
are learning
opportunities and it's

And so the way the
wounding happens then

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.000 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're told
to put this mask on,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:84%
there will be parts
of you that stick out.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Because the mask is not organic.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The mask is
fashioned by society.

And in many cases, allowing
those parts of you to stick out

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
is punished as much as
if you took a mask off.

suspension of disbelief.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.558 align:middle line:10%
And you call the emergency board
meeting, because, I'm sorry,

00:37:42.558 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:10%
we're going to have to
declare martial law,

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:10%
and you, punk rocker, you
guitar-playing artist,

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:10%
and you long hair, you guys
are voted off the island.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Security, escort them
into the cafeteria,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:84%
sequester them until further
notice, which is like forever.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The rest of you, ignore
the banging on the door.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Carry on with the meeting.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So when these board members
within you are exiled,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:90%
it's done out of love.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not malicious.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's done out of love and a
well-meaning but panicked fear.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:10%
The question basically
boils down to,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:10%
to what extent can
you get a reading

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:10%
on what board
members were exiled

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:10%
in order to keep your mask on.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And are you able to actually
recover them and bring them

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:90%
back into the boat with you?

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a funny thing
with these board members.

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:90%
They are life tenured.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a board member, even
if you lock me in the closet,

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
my car key opens every
door in the building.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you lock me in
there and I stay in there,

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:90%
it's because I'm complicit.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.382 align:middle line:84%
I'm the punk rocker,
guitar-playing guy in you,

00:38:52.382 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like well, shit,
I better stay in here.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't want make--

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:90%
because I love everyone too .

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what will often happen
is that several years, sometimes

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
decades will go by, and
the board members who

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
are sitting in the
prison cell sought

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to decide to take action.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They do have full access
to all the resources,

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and they have access to
all the levers down there.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So they can pull
an emergency brake.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:84%
They can get you
fired from your job.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They can give you panic attacks
before you go into meetings.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They can make you wander
off with other people

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
to break off a relationship
that you don't want to be in.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have this compass,
and three load stones are out.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So the compass is decalibrated,
let's say, about 15%

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%
off of True North.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And so with this
decalibrated compass,

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.150 align:middle line:84%
you make all these
same decisions

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because you got to
get on with your life.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Who am I going to marry, what
kind of job I'm going to take,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:84%
what kind of external persona
I'm going to wear and present

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.163 align:middle line:90%
to the outside world.

00:39:54.163 --> 00:39:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You make all these choices
with a compass that

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.311 align:middle line:90%
is decalibrated just about 15%.

00:39:59.311 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Now 15% is about this much.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you deviate two or
three years out of college,

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.730 align:middle line:90%
it's no big deal.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You fast forward that
another 15 to 20 years,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:90%
you're way off mark.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And at around about midlife,
you realize, holy crap,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm way off.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of us
continue, and some of us

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:84%
decide to take off the mask and
take a hard left turn, which

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:90%
ends up breaking a lot of shit.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a decision
to be taken lightly.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are pushed into
it kicking and screaming.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But then you start making your
way back to the original track.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.523 align:middle line:84%
And often, in hindsight,
when they're like, OK, fine.

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I finally recovered the board
member, I've talked to them,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I've let them have
their day in court.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And when they give
their side of the story,

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You realize that they
had a just grievance,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and they only pulled the
emergency brake very, very

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:04.110 align:middle line:84%
begrudgingly because all the
other attempts to email you,

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:84%
text you, everything
was blocked.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:90%
You marked them as spam.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:13.200 align:middle line:84%
You blocked them, and they just
had to continue escalating.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like, as
far as they're concerned,

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
as far as the entire
board is concerned,

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.710 align:middle line:84%
you all parachuted in
here to find and prosecute

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:84%
your meaning and purpose in
you life, for your bliss.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And whatever wound was given
to you was part of the compass.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And now you're following in
the direction of the wound

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.465 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting
the wound guide you.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, that pain you feel,
that is the lost board member

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:52.833 align:middle line:84%
stuffed down,
banging on the door.

00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:56.649 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you need
to numb it so powerfully

00:41:56.649 --> 00:41:58.573 align:middle line:84%
and with so many
different methods.

00:41:58.573 --> 00:42:00.466 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
need to shield it.

00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:02.569 align:middle line:90%
You can't let anyone see that.

00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:05.604 align:middle line:84%
Because if they point that
out, it's just like rips--

00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:08.008 align:middle line:90%
just pulls the wound right open.

00:42:08.008 --> 00:42:10.142 align:middle line:84%
You don't even want to
look at it yourself.

00:42:10.142 --> 00:42:12.996 align:middle line:90%
Why would you?

00:42:12.996 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Not just because it's
painful, but because you've

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.367 align:middle line:84%
been told in no uncertain
terms that even looking at it,

00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:21.951 align:middle line:84%
kind of looking at
it, thinking about it

00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:24.475 align:middle line:90%
will make you unworthy of love.

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:27.661 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if that's
what's on the table,

00:42:27.661 --> 00:42:32.034 align:middle line:84%
I will cut my own arm off
if I can, but you can't.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.006 align:middle line:84%

mountain of societal success,

they've climbed the mountain.

perfect.

00:43:48.454 --> 00:43:50.728 align:middle line:84%

there-- and maybe

he did-- but we need to isolate

is we must endure and face
adversity and challenge

00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:34.861 align:middle line:10%
and negative thinking.

00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:37.505 align:middle line:90%
It is part of being human.

00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:41.712 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is what drives
our quest for enlightenment

00:45:41.712 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:84%
or our quest for spirituality
or our quest for true love.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.503 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's a gift.

00:45:48.503 --> 00:45:51.478 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
throes of challenge

00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:53.111 align:middle line:90%
you have to feel it to heal it.

00:45:53.111 --> 00:45:54.012 align:middle line:90%
You have to honor it.

00:45:54.012 --> 00:45:55.475 align:middle line:90%
You have to endure it.

00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to find help as
you find a way through it.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.223 align:middle line:84%
But you do have
to get through it,

00:46:00.223 --> 00:46:02.476 align:middle line:84%
or you become a victim
of circumstance.

00:46:02.476 --> 00:46:06.203 align:middle line:10%
And then it becomes
a layer and a shield

00:46:06.203 --> 00:46:07.681 align:middle line:10%
to stop love coming in.

00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:09.598 align:middle line:10%
Because you're putting
up protection barriers.

And so it's your wound that
basically throws the penny

into the deep end
of the pool for you,

00:46:30.503 --> 00:46:33.197 align:middle line:84%
then, to dive down in terms

your bliss.

00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:38.847 align:middle line:84%
Following your bliss is the
ultimate soothing because it

00:46:38.847 --> 00:46:42.272 align:middle line:90%
feels good minute-to-minute.

00:46:42.272 --> 00:46:43.985 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
ultimate shielding

00:46:43.985 --> 00:46:46.599 align:middle line:84%
because you have
this goofy smile

00:46:46.599 --> 00:46:47.932 align:middle line:90%
on your face the whole time.

circumstance as a weapon,

reflection and absolute beauty
of who you are as a human.

Or you can say, wow,
that happened to me.

00:47:06.192 --> 00:47:07.734 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do with it?

to get through the
same experience

now that I've had
to experience it?

How do I connect with
other humans that

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:20.375 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this to
show compassion and empathy

00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:23.781 align:middle line:90%

First of all, they're inspired.

They're like, oh my
gosh, it's so amazing.

00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:33.958 align:middle line:84%
But then, hopefully,
their next reaction

00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:37.353 align:middle line:90%
is, what's so special about him?

00:47:37.353 --> 00:47:41.060 align:middle line:84%
If he could do it,
I must have a shot.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:45.537 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen the dice
throw of the universe end

00:47:45.537 --> 00:47:48.422 align:middle line:84%
up where a person is
born into this world

00:47:48.422 --> 00:47:50.826 align:middle line:84%

bliss that is completely

00:47:54.722 --> 00:47:56.165 align:middle line:90%
You were put here for a reason.

00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:58.398 align:middle line:84%
And your mission, if
you choose to accept it,

00:47:58.398 --> 00:48:01.844 align:middle line:84%
is to find that
reason and fulfill it.

of, when you share the parts

regret, when you allow the
world to see all of you,

it is the only time the
world can accept all of you.

that they've spent a lot
of time and energy hiding

from the world.

00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:41.309 align:middle line:90%
And watch how free you feel.

00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:44.424 align:middle line:84%
And watch what you can
do with that energy.

00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:47.339 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe, just maybe,
you can go out into the world

00:48:47.339 --> 00:48:50.735 align:middle line:84%
and inspire other
people to do the same.
