00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us are
familiar with dogs.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.608 align:middle line:84%
We've all lived in
and amongst dogs

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
even if we're not dog
lovers or dog owners.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.923 align:middle line:84%
We know lots of
dogs as individuals.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them
biologically is a gray wolf.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not related
to gray wolves.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:90%
They actually are gray wolves.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of the breeds you
can really see that.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.077 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to
understand if we see,

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
like, any of the
Alaskan sled dog type

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
breeds or we see even
a German shepherd.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You can look at that and
go, I see the wolf in that.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But you start to
get down to, like,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
a Shih Tzu or a pit bull
or a little terrier,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and you don't see the
gray wolf anymore.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You see that domestication
has changed them.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The gray wolf is Canis lupus,
and the domesticated dog

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
is Canis lupus familiaris.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And we add that trinomial part,
that last epithet to its name,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to designate that it's
been domesticated.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:10%
So you can see that as
something's moved away

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:10%
from wild nature and
its diet is changed

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:10%
and its environmental
conditions are changed

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:10%
and, most importantly, probably,
sexual selection becomes

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:10%
a factor--

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:10%
we think a lot about
natural selection,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
how the environment shapes us.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
What we forget is the
incredible power wielded usually

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:10%
by female of a species
to select mates,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:10%
and that will drive radical
changes in phenotypes.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:10%
With domestication, we get
into artificial selection.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.545 align:middle line:10%
So we change the environment.

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:51.045 align:middle line:10%
So it's no longer
natural selection.

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:10%
It's not the
environmental pressure.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:10%
And we become the
sexual selectors, who

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:10%
we want to breed,
and over time, we

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:10%
can-- in actually a fairly
short period of biological time,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:10%
we can take a gray wolf
and turn it to a chihuahua.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.768 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about a
purebred dog, the dog that

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
comes with papers, the dog that
can get into the Kennel Club,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a very
genetically weak animal.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:10%
It's come from a very
restricted gene pool.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So if it was a German
shepherd, they're

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
going to end up with hip
dysplasia almost every time.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
There are pugs where
their entire face has

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.805 align:middle line:90%
been sort of crushed forward.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:90%
They can't breathe anymore.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.482 align:middle line:84%
These are artifacts of
this sexual selection

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about before.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So somebody says, I
like a German shepherd

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
with hips that are lower than
its shoulder blades, let's say.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:10%
And over time, if you look at
pictures of German shepherds

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:10%
50 years ago, 60
years ago to today,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:10%
you'll see that they've gotten
that aesthetic-- that aesthetic

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:10%
that people like in the German
shepherd has been selected for.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Oh, this female has it
and this male has it.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Let's breed them.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:10%
Oh, now let's take puppies
and keep breeding that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:10%
and keep breeding that.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:10%
So as we've done that, we've
ended up with these animals who

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:10%
have all of these
artifacts, these

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:10%
features that actually
impact their health.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:10%
We've done that with
a lot of species.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:10%
We've done that with
cows and sheep and goats.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:10%
And we've done that
with a host of plants.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:10%
We're working on mushrooms
and bacteria and algae

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:10%
and all these things right
now, domesticating the world.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:90%
In the process--

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.045 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we ever set
out to domesticate ourselves.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
But in the process, we did.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand the
timeline that this has happened

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:90%
in, because human beings--

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
we get new archaeological
evidence all the time.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And now genomics and
genetics has shown us--

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
we're able to peer a little
bit deeper into our origins.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
we're at least--

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in our current form, we're
something like 300,000 years

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
old as modern humans.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
But humans as a
genus, genus Homo,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:90%
goes back a lot farther, right?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of us were
hunter gatherers.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%
That's our wild type.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of us only interact
with human beings

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:90%
of the domestic type.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But the wild type
hunts and gathers.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Something between
10,000 and 14,000 years

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:90%
ago, human beings started--

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.767 align:middle line:84%
in the Fertile Crescent,
started to plant things.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
We started to-- we
went from this idea

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
of tending to the wild.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a surviving,
hand-to-mouth kind of a thing.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
People have gotten very good
at getting food resources out

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
of their environment
and also interacting

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
with the environment to
make it more productive.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%
We tended the wild.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We were like gardeners
of the wild landscape.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But this idea to start
planting starts around 10,000

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:90%
to 14,000 years ago.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, we
shift away from being

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.943 align:middle line:84%
hunter gatherers in that area
of the world to being domestic.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
This all starts, like,
10,000 years ago.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, if we took this
timeline, here's 300,000 years.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And this whole time,
we hunt and gather.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.858 align:middle line:90%
And then 10,000 years ago--

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's not like 10,000
years ago-- we call this thing

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the Neolithic Revolution,
the first planting.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It makes it sound like it just
caught fire and went around

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.572 align:middle line:84%
I would point out that this is
not even a complete revolution

00:05:32.572 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
There are people
all around the world

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.791 align:middle line:90%
still hunting and gathering.

00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.293 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But once we start
planting, now we

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
need to guard that area, right?

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:90%
We need to weed it.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.048 align:middle line:90%
We need to till it.

00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We need to keep
animals away from it.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
So people start to settle down.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first time
that we become sedentary.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly, shockingly
fast, out of that

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
starts to emerge
the city-states.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
About 6,000, 7,000 years
ago, we start seeing

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
the first city-states emerge.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we have now
is enough surplus food

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to create an environment where
you can have a class of people

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
who can sit at the top and
not have to forage anymore,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.898 align:middle line:90%
not have to hunt anymore.

00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In a hunter-gatherer
community, everybody's

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.650 align:middle line:84%
like a sovereign individual,
and it's an egalitarian system.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone does overlapping
jobs to make sure

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:90%
that everyone's fed.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Everybody forages.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hunts.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
The chief does, and the
runt of the litter does.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody participates
equally and together.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But now you have
this system where,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
through growing
grains primarily--

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
in Mesopotamia, we're
talking about wheat.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But if we get over to
Asia, another center

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of domestication, we're
talking about rice.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:84%
If we go over to Mesoamerica,
we see another center

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
of domestication that arises
later based around maize

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:90%
or what you now call corn.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We can produce surplus
food by doing this.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
human beings have more food

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:90%
than they can eat.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Hunter gatherers tend to have
this sort of daily subsistence

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:90%
or weekly subsistence, right?

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like we harvest
enough for what we need,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and as it runs down, we go
out and we get more of it.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The hunters go out when the meat
resource starts to be depleted.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The foragers go out when
the plant resource--

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
some is stored, but lots of
it's just sort of eaten up.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But for the first time, now we
have all this surplus grain.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And now we can feed more people.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So immediately what happens is
the population starts to grow.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to
have people settle down.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And then quickly, they
start to grow and multiply.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
get a stratified society

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.275 align:middle line:84%
because you need somebody to
sort of watch over the grain.

00:07:35.275 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you need
somebody to determine

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.282 align:middle line:90%
how to distribute the grain.

00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to start
having rules about that.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got to have
sort of a legal class.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And, well, how do
you enforce that?

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you need
an enforcement class.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.307 align:middle line:84%
Well, who sits on
the top of that?

00:07:46.307 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You start to quickly develop
a hierarchical system.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Living in a hierarchical
structure where

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
you have a ruling class and
a policing and military class

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and an educational
class and then you

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
get down to sort of a
worker class, that's

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:90%
not our natural way of being.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
We can make it work
to some degree,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
but that's not our
biological norm.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Conquistadors and other
colonizers were not nice,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We were going enslaving people
and clear cutting forests

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and really just destroying
nature, destroying people.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.204 align:middle line:90%
We were killing machines.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought that those
people would have just thought

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
that we're evil.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:90%
But they were such humanists.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
They were such lovers
of humans and life.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:90%
But they saw us as victims.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
They thought that white
people had a disease

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.385 align:middle line:90%
that they called Wetiko.

00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
it was a disease

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit that led
us to just destroy things

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:90%
unnecessarily.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:10%
This kind of
dominator mentality,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:10%
this domination of nature--

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm trying to hold
on to that sensibility

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:10%
that, no, people are
not intrinsically evil,

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:10%
that we're in a system--

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:10%
we're living on a game, on a
landscape that is not natural.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up with this kind
of dehumanized view of people

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and this economy that
just-- by its very nature,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
an economy that had to grow
in order to keep working.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So we started taking
stuff, just going to Africa

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and going to South America and
just expanding by any means

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
necessary.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:10%
Really, as I see
it, that's the heart

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:10%
of Wetiko, of what
this disease is.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It's mistaking an operating
system, really, for reality.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
it's really hard

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to see your way out of it.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:10%
The indigenous people
had a heightened ability

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.840 align:middle line:10%
to establish rapport that hadn't
been civilized out of them yet.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Making eye contact, being part
of an oral culture rather than

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
a literate culture
or television culture

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:84%
means that you engage with
people by making eye contact,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
syncing up your breathing,
seeing if their pupils are

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
getting larger or smaller
as you talk to them,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
seeing if your head is making
micro motions of agreement.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Then the oxytocin gets
released in my bloodstream.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
My mirror neurons
start flashing.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way of moving through
the world of always optimized

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
for connection and rapport.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And who is this?

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:90%
How do we connect?

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And if they do that,
even if they're

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
looking at a white
Western conquistador who's

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.335 align:middle line:84%
been told to take his sword
and start killing people,

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
they look in the eyes
and they see, oh,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
there's this human being there
that's being told to go kill

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
or to take, but,
wow, they're in pain.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:90%
They're suffering.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And how do I reach that person?

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous people are in an
altered state of consciousness.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:10%
We're in this simulation.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:10%
We're so removed from nature.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:10%
We are in a CG
movie of the world.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We're walking around like
Spock with our smartphones

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:84%
like tricorders as if
we're on an alien planet.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:90%
That's how separate we are.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We are not yet adapted
to living this way.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
how to live this way.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
We got domesticated and
didn't even realize it.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But unlike a dog, we wear more
of an invisible kind of collar

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and an invisible
leash, because it's

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:84%
like an unseen hand,
where the dog knows

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
you're the master, telling
it what it can and can't do,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:84%
setting the rules
and feeding it.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But we sort of have,
like-- we have a sense

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:90%
in our culture of our freedom.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're much more
like free range cattle

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.532 align:middle line:84%
than we are like free
human beings, told

00:12:22.532 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that if we work hard we'll
have some kind of freedom.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we all
know, as we become adults,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a trap
and that you can't ever

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%
really get free.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It'd be more fair to
say we're free range.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
human domestication

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is seven billion
people, most of whom

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
live on a giant human
factory farm where

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.678 align:middle line:84%
we can move about freely, but
we don't have the true freedom

00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that hunter gatherers
had, and that's

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the kind of freedom
most of us can't even

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.853 align:middle line:90%
really imagine anymore.

00:12:48.853 --> 00:13:01.553 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in most respects,
we're like the rest of life

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that,
particularly in the past 300

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
years, so many people seem
to have forgotten that.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Toni Morrison died recently,
the Nobel novelist.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
She was saying that,
when she was growing up,

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
animals weren't incidental
to people's lives.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:10%
They were intimately
connected with their lives,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:10%
not as pets, but as part of
the ecosystem in which they

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:10%
lived and depended.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:10%
Farmers had cattle and sheep and
not only that, other animals,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:10%
which they knew by name.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:10%
And we had an
intimate relationship

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:10%
with the natural world
in every respect.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:10%
People understood the
pattern of seasons.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
They understood the pattern
of weather formations.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They understood intuitively
the different characteristics

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and personalities almost of
animals they worked with,

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:90%
depended upon, lived from.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They're an intimate part
of the human economy,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as they still are in a
sense in parts of the world.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
But then, in recent years, with
the growth of industrialism

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.165 align:middle line:84%
and consumerism and the
systems of mass food production

00:14:00.165 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and consumption, we've
become distanced from them.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Now our relationship
with animals

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is reduced to often this rather
exaggerated sense of affection

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:90%
for individual pets.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:10%
And people who have become
tremendously sentimental

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:10%
about household pets
will nonetheless

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:10%
sit by and watch the mass
slaughter of animals for food

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:10%
and eat burgers at the table and
feed bits of them to their pets

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:10%
with a kind of
dewy eyed sentiment

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:10%
and not recognize the
carnage that's been wrought

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.355 align:middle line:10%
on the planet as a consequence.

00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:10%
Toni Morrison's point
was that, that we

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:10%
used to have this very intimate
relationship with animals

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:10%
in our ecosystem.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Part of my point is,
in most respects,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we are just like the
rest of life on Earth.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Most of the creatures, the
mammals and the higher order

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
animals, have--

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:84%
we know they have
feelings, sensibilities.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:90%
They have affections.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:90%
They mourn.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
They grieve.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
They exult. They raise children.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The fact they're a
different form of life

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.738 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they're
separate from us

00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:90%
or that we should despise them.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
We know this to be true.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But a big part of
what I'm marking for

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is that we should
restore those connections

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.872 align:middle line:84%
or at least restore our sense of
compassion for the rest of life

00:15:10.872 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:84%
on Earth rather than
wreak the havoc against it

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But there are-- clearly,
there are some respects

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.485 align:middle line:90%
in which we are different.

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:18.943 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
silly to deny them.

00:15:18.943 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, on the contrary, it
behooves us to understand them

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:90%
and to cultivate them.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, we are
sitting here surrounded

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:90%
by advanced technology.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
that human beings

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.125 align:middle line:84%
are capable of that no other
species has showed itself,

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
at least so far as we know.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.632 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to overestimate
the impact of industrialism.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it has its
roots in the 18th century

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and a little earlier as a
force of economic change.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
But it led to a massive
shift in the way people

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:90%
lived and worked.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The great majority of people
in Europe and in the Americas

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:90%
lived and worked in the fields.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:10%
But with industrialism,
they started

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:10%
to migrate into the cities
to work in the factories

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.728 align:middle line:10%
and to dig the roads
and build the railways

00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:10%
and create this massive
infrastructure that

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:10%
was required.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:10%
And that needed a new
sort of workforce.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.630 align:middle line:10%
It needed people who were
literate to a certain degree,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:10%
who were numerate
to a certain degree.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But it really was divided
into several groups.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of people
during the industrial period

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
were required to do manual
work, to tend the machines,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to wield the shovels, the
picks, and wield the hammers.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The hallmark
of industrialism,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
really more than the steam
engine or anything else,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:90%
is the clock.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
The power of the clock
in the Industrial Age

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is that, before
the Industrial Age,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
people would create
value and exchange it.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll make a candle
or make some shoes

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to market and
exchange it with someone else.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And when the Industrial
Age happened,

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
what it was really about
was disconnecting people

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:90%
from the value they created.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:10%
So instead of me making a pair
of shoes and selling them,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:10%
now it's me going to
work at a factory,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:10%
nailing one nail into
the bottom of a shoe

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:10%
and handing it over
to the next guy.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And instead of selling my
value, I'm selling my time.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm working by the hour.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
They put the clock up on the
clock tower as if to say, look,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:90%
it's all fair.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
An hour is an hour.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that just?

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But what's intrinsically
unfair is that I'm not

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:90%
allowed to create value.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm only allowed
to sell my time.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And now, 500 years
later, 600 years later,

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.428 align:middle line:84%
we see it as, well,
that's employment.

00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You just get a job,
and that's what you do.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:90%
You work 40 hours a week.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:10%
It's like, no, but
that's sort of the moment

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:10%
that time is money was born,
because time was money.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It was all about time.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the only metric
that tends to matter

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:90%
is the efficiency.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.270 align:middle line:84%
How much work can I get out
of someone in that hour?

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
How much value can I
extract in that hour?

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So I want to increase
the efficiency.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'd stand next to
workers with a stopwatch

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and see, how many
nails can they put

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
in the bottom of that
shoe in 30 seconds?

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, get it down to 28.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Get it down to 20.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Once we start looking at people
as mechanisms through which we

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
extract value,
then it wasn't too

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
long until our education system
kind of flipped on its head.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The public education
was originally

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
invented as kind of a
mercy or a compensation.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:10%
It was so that the coal
miner could come home

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:10%
after a day of work and
be able to read a novel

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:10%
and appreciate it or be
able to read the paper

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:10%
and then vote effectively
or intelligently.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:10%
It was compensation
for a life of hard work

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:10%
so you could have the dignity
of having a mind that actually

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:10%
functioned.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, over time and
I guess because of time

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and the value of
efficiency, we started

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:30.183 align:middle line:84%
to externalize job training
to public education.

00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There have
always been schools.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.422 align:middle line:84%
People have always been able
to get themselves educated.

00:19:35.422 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
What we're really
talking about are

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
the growth of systems of
mass public education.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And they really
have their origins

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
in most countries in the
sort of mid 19th century.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:84%
By mass public education,
I mean systems of education

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that were initiated by
central governments, which

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
were available, sort of free at
the point of delivery in most

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
cases, and, in due
course, were compulsory

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:90%
for certain age groups.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, historically,
they're relatively recent.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
These systems, in my view-- and
I've written quite a bit about

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
grew up in the interests of
the Industrial Revolution

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and, to some degree,
in the image of it.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:84%
They grew up because
of a need in part

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to create a mass workforce for
this huge industrial complex

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
that was evolving,
because the rough equation

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.713 align:middle line:84%
was that about
80% of people were

00:20:31.713 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
going to be selling
their physical labor

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and maybe 20% would be selling
their intellectual labor.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was built that way.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
economic impulse.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is that the system

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
was organized a bit on the
principles of mass production.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So people were selected
for certain roots.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Their kids went through
the system by age group.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
This was a massive invention
to put the system into place.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:10%
But children were-- they went in
at a certain age, four or five.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They then went
through by age group.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:90%
They still do.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
points of selection

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.322 align:middle line:84%
where some kids go that
way, some kids go that way.

00:21:05.322 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
People were selected according
to whether they were thought

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:90%
to be more fit for manual work.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they might have the
sort of spark they thought

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
was needed for academic work or
a particular interest in that.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But they were sort of
divided into sheep and goats.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And then a few people went on
to university as a consequence.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So the organizational
principle was

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
very similar to mass
production systems.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It was based on standardization,
conformity, selection,

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was also
geared to selecting

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
a particular type of commodity
with a particular sort

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:90%
of product at the far end.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.733 align:middle line:84%
So what you had evolving
over that period

00:21:43.733 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:90%
was a kind of pyramid.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:10%
There was a broad base of
people who were doing--

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:10%
who were being educated to a
certain level of basic numeracy

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:10%
and literacy.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a group
slightly higher

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
than that who would be going
on to administrative work

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.968 align:middle line:84%
and certain sorts of
managerial type jobs

00:21:57.968 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and then a group that
would be educated

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to take on these sort of
higher leadership roles.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And the system was
composed in that image--

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:84%
broad base of
elementary education,

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:84%
the slightly narrow band of sort
of high school, middle school

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and high school, and then
quite a narrow band of people

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:90%
who went on to university.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And like any system of
mass industrial production,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
it was predicated on generating
a fair amount of waste

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
materials because not everybody
was suited to the task

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
that they were
being groomed for,

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and so they went to one side.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was at that
point we invented the whole idea

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.775 align:middle line:90%
of educational disability.

00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, there's a model.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the Prussian
model of education

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:10%
where the school is
modeled after the factory

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:10%
with bells ringing after
each period and the teachers

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:10%
like the foremen and the
students follow the directions.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:10%
So now we've got the
principals of our high schools

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:10%
and the presidents of
our colleges meeting

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:10%
with the CEOs of
corporations to find out,

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:10%
what do you want our
students to learn?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:10%
What do you want them to
know so they can get jobs?

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:10%
How do you want
us to train them?

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:10%
So corporations are just
externalizing employee training

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:10%
to the schools.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
If anything, you're doing
the opposite of education.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not creating inquisitive,
open, creative, disruptive

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:90%
minds.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
favor liberal arts.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In a modern age,
this is where we

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:90%
get what we keep calling STEM.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
This is science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But why do we want
to teach STEM--

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:84%
so that they learn
how to program

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
so they can go and make
computers for Silicon Valley

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.462 align:middle line:90%
and get jobs.

00:23:44.462 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't want them
to learn the humanities,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:90%
because then what?

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to start
to question the whole thing.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Critical thinking makes
you look outside the frame

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
of corporate capitalism and
say, well, wait a minute,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
where's the meaning in this?

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:90%
What's the future in this?

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
What are we externalizing
to nature, to women,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:90%
to other people?

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So unless you are able
to do critical thinking,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
you're not educated at all.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.475 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.475 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the reasons why
I think it's very important that

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
we move away from some idea of
standardization and conformity

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that individual
achievement, individual values,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
individual potential in lives
are as various as the people

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Education has to
become individualized.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you
standardize it, you're

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:84%
bound to create a catastrophe
for some people that

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.705 align:middle line:84%
would be avoidable if you
saw them as individuals.

00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:57.225 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.225 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful woman, when
she was a young kid

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:06.188 align:middle line:84%
in elementary school,
was in constant trouble.

00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:90%
She didn't pay attention.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
She fidgeted a
great deal and tend

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
to get up and wander around.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.648 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the school
contacted her mother

00:25:13.648 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and said that they thought
Gillian had a learning

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:90%
difficulty.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.043 align:middle line:84%
And they explained to
her what she should do

00:25:18.043 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and that she should take
Gillian to see a specialist.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.668 align:middle line:84%
And her mother was naturally
devastated to hear that.

00:25:22.668 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:84%
He asked to go and
sit at the far end

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
of the room on
this leather sofa,

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and he talked to her mother
about all the problems

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Gillian was having and
asked her to describe them.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said, all this time that
her mother was speaking to him,

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.283 align:middle line:90%
he was staring at Gillian.

00:25:36.283 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
was uncomfortable,

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting on my
hands so I wouldn't fidget.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
This went on for
several minutes.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.193 align:middle line:84%
And then he stood up
and he said to Gillian,

00:25:43.193 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
look, this has been
very interesting,

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Gillian, but I need to speak
to your mother privately now.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you wait here,
we're going to leave you,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:90%
but we'll be back.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.483 align:middle line:90%
We won't be very far away.

00:25:52.483 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back
in a few minutes.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said they got
up and they went out.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But as they went out, he
leaned across his desk

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.276 align:middle line:90%
and turned the radio on.

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:02.982 align:middle line:84%
And he got into the
car, apparently,

00:26:02.982 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and he turned to her mother
and said, just stand here

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.315 align:middle line:90%
for a moment and watch her.

00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
See what she does.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:84%
She said there was a
window back into the room.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.773 align:middle line:84%
So she couldn't see them,
but they could see her.

00:26:12.773 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:84%
She said the minute they
were out of the room,

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
she was on their feet
moving to the music.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
She said she danced
around on top of the sofa

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and on the tables.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, because she'd
been sitting still for so long.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They watched this for
a couple of minutes,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and he turned to mother,
and he said, you know,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
She's a dancer.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.798 align:middle line:90%
Take her to a dance school.

00:26:35.798 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
She went to the
Royal Ballet School.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.452 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
walked into this room.

00:26:43.452 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'll
never forget it.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.590 align:middle line:84%
It was full of people like me,
people who couldn't sit still

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and, as she put it, people
who have to move to think.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
She was eventually accepted
into the Royal Ballet,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and then she became a soloist,
a principal and a soloist,

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and had a wonderful career
at the Royal Ballet,

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:90%
traveled the world with them.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, when she
left, she formed

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
her own company, the
Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
put all kinds of productions
on in Broadway in the West End.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And then she met
Andrew Lloyd Webber

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
as an accomplished and
very successful dancer

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and choreographer at this point.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And Andrew asked if
she would choreograph

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
"Cats," which she did,
and "Phantom of the Opera"

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and other of his productions.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:84%
She became his
principal choreographer.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:10%
She went on to give
pleasure to millions

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and became a multi-millionaire.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And it's perfectly possible
these days that somebody else

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:10%
would tell her to sit down, calm
down, and take these tablets.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't sick.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.930 align:middle line:90%
She was a dancer.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this for an
awful lot of people,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.605 align:middle line:84%
that if you stereotype people
against a very narrow view

00:27:44.605 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of ability, then
you automatically

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
generate a very big
conception of inability

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:90%
and, at worst, of disability.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what goes on
in our school systems

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is not the result
of legislation.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of
habit and ritual.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing anywhere,
really, in most of our systems

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that requires that we
educate kids by age group.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
We just do because
we think you have to.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.934 align:middle line:90%
But you don't.

00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And outside the schools, we
wouldn't think of doing that.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
When kids leave
school at 3 o'clock

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
or 4 o'clock, we

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
don't say, now, all
the four-year-olds

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.538 align:middle line:90%
be sure to go over there.

00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Keep away from eight-year-olds.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Bad things happen, we know.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Communities are
intergenerational.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to divide
the day into subjects.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
We just do.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.713 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of great
schools that don't do that

00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and having wonderful
success as a result.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is one of the
defining characteristics

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:90%
of our species.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things
that makes us human.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
We create the lives that we live
through the possibilities we

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:84%
see and the
opportunities we take

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:90%
or the ones we step away from.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It's how people's
lives are transformed

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:84%
by discovering a
talent and the passion

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose
that goes with it.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Gillian
Lynne story is about.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Creativity, in other words,
isn't some exotic byproduct

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that happens to be
present in a few people.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.480 align:middle line:84%
We've come to think
of it that way.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:90%
But it's not true.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is the
pulse of human life.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We live in a city that wasn't
here 150 years ago like this.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
This is being created by the
interplay of millions of minds

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
working together,
collaborating, where all of us

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
now based in the great
net of the world wide web

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and all of its works.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.377 align:middle line:10%
This is new to our generation.

00:29:46.377 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:90%
This didn't happen before.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.543 align:middle line:90%
It didn't come into being.

00:29:48.543 --> 00:29:51.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it didn't come
around like the oceans.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.028 align:middle line:90%
We made this.

00:29:52.028 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Somebody designed the
clothes that we wear.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is what contributes
to the nature of our humanity.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We can use it and
we can misuse it.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, saying that
education should cultivate

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
children's creative
capacities isn't

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
kind of an appeal to
have some extra hour

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of free play-based activities
on a Friday afternoon,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:84%
though I think we should have
free play-based activities

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:90%
on a Friday afternoon.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It's to recognize that
there is a set of capacities

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:84%
here, which isn't
separate from, but it's

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:84%
integrated with everything
else that we do.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Ray Kurzweil,
the VP of Technology of Google,

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
by 2029, all of us,
within our pockets,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.707 align:middle line:84%
will have our own personalized
artificial intelligence.

00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
This is also going to be true
for kids in the developing

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:84%
world because the cost of
smartphones and tablets

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:90%
is going to drop to $10 apiece.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:84%
What this means
is that all of us

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.710 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
a backup brain.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Sugata Mitra won the
TED Prize for Education.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:90%
I once heard him speak.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the way we
educate our kids is ridiculous.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So someone asked, what do
we need to stop teaching?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:10%
And he said, stop teaching
spelling, stop teaching math,

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:10%
because our kids are going
to have a backup brain that

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:10%
can already do that.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Why are we teaching them skills
that were needed in 1970?

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So then the question is,
what do we teach our kids?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, we teach our
kids transformation.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
learning and transformation.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Learning is facts and figures.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Learning is stuff that
you easily forget.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:90%
But transformation is different.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Transformation is
beyond learning.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Transformation is an
expansion of your world view.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And a mind, once
expanded, can never again

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:90%
shrink to its original size.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Once your world view changes
where you become more authentic

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:84%
or you become more
empathetic and kind

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.730 align:middle line:84%
or you become more compassionate
or you become more autonomous,

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:90%
you never lose that sense.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, philosophers and
anthropologists and professors

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
who study transformation
say that transformation

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
in the world today
comes from two things.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The first is the
disorienting dilemma.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It is the setback,
the suffering,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the thing that pounds you
and knocks you off course.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:10%
But when you bounce back
from that bankruptcy

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:10%
or from that broken heart
or from that divorce

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.702 align:middle line:10%
or from that bout in
hospital, you are wiser,

00:32:33.702 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and you see the world
in a different way,

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:10%
and you know what you need to
do next to avoid that setback.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Google did a study.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
This was cited in Salim Ismail's
fantastic book "Exponential

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Organizations."

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Google found that its
best people were not,

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:84%
contrary to popular belief, STEM
graduates, but young people who

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
had gone through suffering and
had emerged from that suffering

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:84%
humbler, kinder,
more compassionate.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
Those were the best people.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, transformation
comes from suffering.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But it also comes from a gradual
expansion of meaning schema.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:84%
This gradual expansing
of meaning schema

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.547 align:middle line:84%
is when we learn from mentors,
when we travel the world, when

00:33:25.547 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
we're introduced to people
who have figured it out

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and they are willing to
help us figure it out,

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:90%
when we wisen up.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:84%
The point of education has to
be to speed up the accumulation

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:90%
of meaning schema--

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in short, to speed up wisdom,
to speed up transformation

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:84%
so that the human
machine doesn't

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:90%
have to go through suffering.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we do go
through suffering,

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:53.135 align:middle line:84%
we know how to sail past
it and see it as a lesson.

00:33:53.135 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So the problem
with our education

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
is it isn't paying
enough attention

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to helping people
transform by teaching them

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.410 align:middle line:84%
new definitions
of relationships,

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
new definitions of
love, by teaching them

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that the dogma of
organized religion

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
can often create
pain and setback

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.415 align:middle line:84%
and to teach them new
models of spirituality,

00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to teach them creativity, to
teach them entrepreneurship,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to teach them that
love doesn't have

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:90%
to come from outside forces--

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:90%
it can be generated within--

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.574 align:middle line:84%
that you are enough as
you are, no matter what

00:34:22.574 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
your parents or your
teacher or your preacher

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:90%
or the media says.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.050 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different
components of transformation

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can serve up to
our children, yet we don't.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.610 align:middle line:90%
We teach people biology.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
But we did not teach them
how to extend their lifespans

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and exist in a healthy way.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
We teach people morality,
but we don't teach them

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
how to truly be
compassionate and empathize

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:90%
with other human beings.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We teach people accounting,
but we don't teach them

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:84%
how to be an
entrepreneur and how

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
setbacks and the failure

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that you might face when
you go on that journey.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:05.742 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.742 --> 00:35:08.676 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:08.676 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we're living at
a time when one of the most

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
serious epidemics, one the most
serious threats to human health

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and well-being around
the world is depression,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
depression at a time when we
are materially better off than

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.900 align:middle line:84%
at any time in the
history of our species.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But our spiritual lives
are a mess in most cases.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of reasons for it.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But people lack a
sense of well-being,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.140 align:middle line:90%
lack a sense of fulfillment.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of these things
are the consequence

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.263 align:middle line:84%
of false conceptions about how
people work, how they connect.

00:35:55.263 --> 00:35:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us, whether you live
in the Western world or you

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
live in a very
traditional society,

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.190 align:middle line:84%
like in India or in China,
we are all like fish swimming

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:90%
in water.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:84%
A fish swimming in water cannot
see and has no idea that it is

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.330 align:middle line:84%
in water because it is
so immersed in water.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, when we
live in this world,

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:84%
we are immersed in the
culturescape, a tangled

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
web of rituals, beliefs,
ideologies, dogma,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
ideas spread from generation
to generation to generation.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:10%
But we don't know that all of
this exists solely in our head.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:10%
Ken Wilber says that there
are two types of reality.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:10%
There is absolute truth.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.347 align:middle line:10%
Absolute truth is
this rock is hard,

00:36:36.347 --> 00:36:38.180 align:middle line:10%
and if I hit you on the
head with this rock,

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:10%
it's going to hurt.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Every society, every
culture can agree to that.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And then there's relative truth.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And relative truth is the ideas
that we have individually,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:10%
culture by culture by
culture, on love, marriage,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:10%
relationship, the definition
of ideas like success,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:10%
career, the 9:00 to 5:00, our
ideas of God or what is right

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:10%
or what is wrong or morality.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the stuff
that's stressing this out

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:84%
is stuff that doesn't
actually exist.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It simply exists
in our own heads,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:84%
in this realm of relative truth,
because we were conditioned

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:90%
to believe that it is so.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If I'm identifying as body,
if I'm moving through the world

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:28.590 align:middle line:84%
as separate object body, whether
it's my mind, my role, my job,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
my title, my weight, my
gender, my sexual orientation,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever aspect of this that
I'm rooted in this identity--

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.750 align:middle line:90%
this is who I am--

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:37.890 align:middle line:90%
or my current emotion--

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:84%
anger, frustration-- if I'm
moving through the world

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:90%
from that place, that's object.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
That's body, even
the emotional stuff.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's chemistry and
electricity in my brain.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.255 align:middle line:84%
I'm then going to
respond to you as object.

00:37:56.255 --> 00:37:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.310 align:middle line:90%
There's separation between us--

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
one object over here, all this
huge chunk of empty space.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
There's another
object over there.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:90%
So we're all separate.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.110 align:middle line:84%
As long as I'm moving
through the world

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:18.950 align:middle line:84%
as separate disconnected object,
not only am I going to suffer,

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to bring
about suffering in the world

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
because it's disconnected.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:90%
It's an object.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So an object can
only be two things.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Either you're something that's
going to be of benefit to me--

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I can use you to get ahead or
for my own personal pleasure,

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be--

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:84%
or you are an
obstacle on my path.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And so whether you
are a human being,

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.500 align:middle line:84%
whether you are a tree,
whether you are a river,

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:52.110 align:middle line:84%
either I'm going to use you
or I need to remove you.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:84%
In either case, I'm going to
bring about suffering for you.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to truth.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to spirit.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
connection to source.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our connection to
the oneness of consciousness

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:90%
that flows through us.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And so our lives hurt.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And we blame the stock market.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And we blame interest
rates and mortgage rates.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And we blame the traffic.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And we blame our weight.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And we blame our employers and
our employees or our spouses

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
or our lack of spouses
or our children

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:84%
or our lack of children
or whatever it may be.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, the
problem is that we're

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:84%
moving through the world
with a broken connection,

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.550 align:middle line:90%
and so it hurts.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:59.997 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> People have social-emotional
problems if they don't connect

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.950 align:middle line:84%
with each other or if
they're kept apart.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like social
media at the moment.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a total misnomer.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:90%
These are not social media.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:84%
These are for the most
part anti-social media.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
They're not helping
people connect.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
They're disabling
people's capacity

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to connect on a personal level.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a
conversation on Skype,

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and the person on the
other end agrees with you.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But because you can't see
their pupils getting larger,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.540 align:middle line:84%
you can't see
their head nodding,

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.310 align:middle line:84%
your body doesn't get
the sense of agreement.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Your mirror neurons don't fire.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The oxytocin doesn't
get transmitted.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And you trust humans less
because they're not giving you,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.910 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:84%
they're not triggering the
sort of painstakingly evolved

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
social mechanisms that we
have that we've developed

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
over 600,000 years of evolution
to bond with other people

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and do the necessary
collaboration and social group

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:90%
formation.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We delude ourselves into
thinking we're connecting with

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:84%
other people
through our devices.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
With social media, you
measure your insides

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.345 align:middle line:90%
by other people's outsides.

00:41:07.345 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't look up and see some
celebrity in a sports car

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and say, that could be me,
but a lot of people do.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what media and
social media teaches you.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
It teaches you, if I work hard,
I can be the next whomever.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Accept who you are today.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you can try to
make your life better,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but know the things that are
going to just make you happy,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be the quality
connecting with other people,

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.740 align:middle line:84%
being grateful for
what you do have.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So all the things
that we're taught

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:44.590 align:middle line:84%
by social media and the
media that will make us happy

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:90%
actually make us miserable.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, I
live in a culture

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:84%
with the inalienable
right to pursue happiness.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You cannot pursue happiness.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- it's a ramification.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is a byproduct.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to
do is sleep correctly.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Have loving relationships.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Eat well.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Get some exercise.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not brain surgery.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, 100 million
prescriptions

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:84%
for antidepressants are
written in this country

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:12.760 align:middle line:90%
of 330 million people.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an insane
time we're living in.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:90%
All of us have our phones.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of the times they're
under our pillows.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anyone who
doesn't go to the bathroom

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:84%
without an iPad or
something in there.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids who were raised with
social media likes are already

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
quantized.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:84%
They're already quantifying
their understanding

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:90%
So the problem with it is--

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:84%
to me, it's almost less
about that it's specifically

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
social media, but that
their sense of self-worth

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is external to them
rather than experiential,

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that it's something telling
me how much I'm worth.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's not even human.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
When it's a number,
then it's not actually

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:90%
feeding my organism.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
It's feeding some
accountant inside myself.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.750 align:middle line:84%
That might be
Wetiko right there.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the disease,
this quantified self.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How we are in the world,
how we relate to each other,

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:84%
how we relate to the planet
is part of the problem.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And unless we get
to the root of that

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and start to think in a more
integrated, more holistic, more

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.060 align:middle line:84%
humanistic way about our
place in the order of things,

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.858 align:middle line:84%
then we'll simply continue
refining a system that's

00:43:38.858 --> 00:43:41.400 align:middle line:84%
run its course, and this creates
all the problems that we now

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.450 align:middle line:90%
scratch our heads about.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.310 align:middle line:90%
We've created the food crisis.

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We've created the
economic crisis.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We've created the
climate crisis.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And if we're to
solve them, we have

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to get even more
creative, not less.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:05.034 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we justified
our competitive landscape.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
We justified this
system with a kind

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of a bastardized
interpretation of Darwin.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Species compete,
and one succeeds,

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's why humans
are on the top.

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:90%
We won.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We're the apex
predator, and yay.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.125 align:middle line:90%
And I looked-- I read Darwin.

00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
Darwin, I mean, there's

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:84%
a little tiny bit
on competition.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, what Darwin

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:84%
is marveling at
page after page is

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.553 align:middle line:84%
cooperation and collaboration
between species.

00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the
science teacher

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
who taught me about
evolution and said

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that the trees are competing
for sunlight in the forest.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And the big tree will
get up to the sun first,

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and the little tree will be
in the shade and will die.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.270 align:middle line:10%
And I've just read this
book, "Secret Life of Trees,"

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.950 align:middle line:10%
and it turns out
just the opposite,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.470 align:middle line:10%
that the big tree that's
getting the sunlight

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.140 align:middle line:10%
shares its nutrients
through the soil

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.570 align:middle line:10%
through a matrix of mycelia--

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:05.280 align:middle line:10%
of mushrooms in the soil--

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:10%
with the little tree.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.713 align:middle line:84%
And then the little tree
gets all those nutrients.

00:45:08.713 --> 00:45:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the winter when the
big tree loses its leaves,

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:84%
the little tree, which
is usually an evergreen,

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:16.680 align:middle line:84%
passes nutrients back
through those same mushrooms

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and give the nutrients
back to the big tree.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So the two trees are
not competing for sun.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:90%
They're collaborating.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:84%
They have diverse
strategies of survival,

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
which allows the forest
as a collective organism

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:90%
to support itself.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:10%
So if human beings are
the most advanced species

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.650 align:middle line:10%
on the evolutionary
trail, it's just

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.820 align:middle line:10%
a reflection of the
complexity of collaboration

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:10%
that we were able to do.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Human beings are
very programmable.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:84%
They can be programmed
towards ideas

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:84%
that unify them and
create more compassion

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.500 align:middle line:90%
and love in the world.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But they can also be
programmed for ideas that

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.950 align:middle line:90%
create this unity and hate.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
The question is, where
is the human race going,

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and what do we want to bet on?

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are moving
more and more towards unity.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at issues
like global warming,

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.500 align:middle line:84%
no country on its own can
prevent global warming.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.350 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it is to
do it as a collective species.

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.110 align:middle line:84%
No country on its
own can prevent wars.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it is to do
it as a unified human species.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.733 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not only feasible,
but it is already happening.

00:46:30.733 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are throwing
their hands up about this

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and say, how can you
possibly change us?

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is you can if you
give people a better argument,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:84%
if you open their eyes to
more profound principles

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.750 align:middle line:84%
of human welfare
and flourishing,

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:84%
if you persuade them
in the right way

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that this is a better way to
do things and then show them

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:84%
how it can be done, how
other people are doing it.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But then movements start to
happen, and they do happen.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.653 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it now.

00:46:56.653 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:10%
You can see it in the
environmental world with Greta

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:10%
Thunberg and the rest who are--

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:10%
one person becomes
a dozen people

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:06.270 align:middle line:10%
becomes several thousand,
and then you have a movement.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think, if there's
the appetite for change

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.672 align:middle line:84%
and the impulse for change
and I feel it happening,

00:47:13.672 --> 00:47:14.880 align:middle line:90%
then the ideas are out there.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The practices are there
to help make it a reality.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> First, we need to
figure out, who am I?

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.600 align:middle line:84%
The most important
aspect is, how do I

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:90%
move through the world as that?

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, OK, what
is my unique way

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.080 align:middle line:90%
that that's going to manifest?

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm a school teacher.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I'm the waitress who
serves up smiles with muffins,

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.910 align:middle line:10%
whatever I may be.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But that is all in service
of that higher purpose, which

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.710 align:middle line:90%
is to wake up.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that connection to the
children, the grandchildren,

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.800 align:middle line:84%
the future, to the
Earth, that connection

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.970 align:middle line:90%
is what will save our species.

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're talking
about personal depression,

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.330 align:middle line:84%
personal addiction,
personal sense of misery,

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:16.110 align:middle line:84%
or you're talking about
planetary destruction,

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:84%
at the very core, the
answer is the same--

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.190 align:middle line:90%
connection, oneness.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.740 align:middle line:90%
