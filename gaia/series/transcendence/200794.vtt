these are a mold toxin.

at a cellular, a sub-cellular,
at a biological level.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
These are things that can
grow on your crops that

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
are poisonous for
humans and animals.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:10%
When they feed these
crops to animals,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:10%
they notice an increase
in lesions in arteries,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:10%
a decrease in fertility,
an increase in cancer,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:10%
increases in obesity,
and increases

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:10%
in all the bad things that
are happening in humans.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body except
for your red blood cells

is studded with hundreds to
thousands of ancient bacteria

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.608 align:middle line:84%
that create power
from air in food,

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%

What happens if you take low
doses of naturally occurring,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:10%
plant-based mold toxins in
your coffee, in your grain,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:10%
in your corn, or in animals
that ate those things?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:10%
You get emotional.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.832 align:middle line:10%
And you start yelling at
your kids or your boss.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up feeling
like, well, today

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
is a really bad day, and
it's someone else's fault.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
What's going on is
you're physically

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.635 align:middle line:90%
inflamed and uncomfortable.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:90%
We know that tiny amounts--

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
100 micrograms of this toxin can
completely change your reality.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.731 align:middle line:90%
We're that sensitive.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So what if we could just
turn that down a little bit?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And what if we used other
plant-based compounds?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Would you actually show up
differently as a human being?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Could you more easily
have a meditation

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:10%

experience if your biology is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:10%
working right?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And the secret that
no one had told me

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:10%
was that if you want to do
the personal development work,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:10%
if your body, your hardware
isn't working very well,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be really
difficult, if not impossible.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So get your body
working well enough

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%

northeast United States kid.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I was living a
pretty normal life,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
eating the sad American
diet, drinking every night,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
smoking cigarettes,
having fun in my early 20s

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
when out of nowhere, I started
getting ocular migraine

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.158 align:middle line:90%
headaches.

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
An ocular migraine
headache will end your day.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You are now laying
in bed in the dark.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Every bit of stimuli
will hurt your brain.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.804 align:middle line:84%
It's just
excruciatingly painful.

00:04:16.804 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So I went from being
normal to all a sudden,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I had this really
severe health condition.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I come from a family of nurses,
so the first thing I did was I

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:90%
went to my aunt's.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this is
happening, What do I do?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.932 align:middle line:84%
And they got me one of the best
neurologists in Connecticut.

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.832 align:middle line:90%
They did MRIs.

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
They put me on all kinds
of prescription drugs.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were going at it the
contemporary medicine way.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So I walked away and
realized that modern medicine

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:90%
had nothing for me.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
I was getting these
excruciatingly painful

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
life-altering
headaches twice a week.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
And I had no answers.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Out of desperation,
I started looking

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.248 align:middle line:90%
into any alternative there was.

00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:10%
So digging deeper, I
started looking into my diet

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:10%
and trying to figure out what
I might be eating that could

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:10%
be contributing to these.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.063 align:middle line:10%
And so I started taking out
cheese, and taking out meat,

00:05:21.063 --> 00:05:23.903 align:middle line:10%
and taking out gluten,
and all that stuff.

00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Nothing really
seemed to budge it,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
until I took out an herb that
I had been taking probably

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.397 align:middle line:84%
since I was like 16 without
realizing it was an herb,

00:05:33.397 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and that it was a
medicine, and that I

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
had been taking it every single
morning without realizing it.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's coffee.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:90%
So it was crazy.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an herb
that healed me.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
understanding of herbalism

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding that
we Americans, for sure,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
are on a serious herbal medicine
that we don't even realize

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:90%
has that kind of potency.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got off coffee,
migraines went away like that.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Never came back.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The only time I ever have
a problem with migraines

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is if I get into that busy
realm of life where I'm like,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I could use a little
bit of coffee.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's only when I drink coffee
that I'll ever get a migraine.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking the last 10
years of my life-- migraine

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:90%
free.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It came down to understanding
a highly medicinal herb

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that I had been ingesting
without realizing it.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The US is one of the only
developed countries that has no

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:90%
standard for mold in coffee.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
China has standards
for mold in coffee.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Europe has standards
for mold in coffee.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed a former
president of the Specialty

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Coffee Association
where he's like, Dave --

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I was in Japan when the
trade minister of Japan

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
rejected a thousand shipping
containers of coffee

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
high in mold toxins.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what did
they do with the coffee?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
sent it to America,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's legal
to sell it there.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.553 align:middle line:10%
But why should you care?

00:06:52.553 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
drink coffee that

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
has mold you won't taste
in it, you actually

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:84%
get about an hour or two
later, if you're sensitive,

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:90%
especially, you can get cranky.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You can get angry.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
You can get blood
sugar cravings.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
You get a crash, like,
I need more coffee.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So I gave up coffee
for five years,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:90%
this great love of my life.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it made me feel
crappy half the time.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.788 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
what was going on,

00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
different coffees
do different things

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.618 align:middle line:90%
based on how they're processed.

00:07:16.618 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I was
obese and I had all this brain

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
fog as a young man was that I
was exposed to these toxins.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:10%
When I did a test
with Dr. Daniel Amen

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:10%
where we injected
radioactive sugar

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:10%
and looked at where
it went in my brain,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:10%
the finding was, Dave, you have
chemically induced brain damage

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:10%
from mold toxins.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to reverse that
by removing them from my food,

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
removing them from
my environment.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.112 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I have more energy now
than I ever have before,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.903 align:middle line:84%
because I was able to
take these things out.

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:10%
We have this mindset that says
as Western medical doctors

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:10%
or as academic
scientists, we have

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:10%
to understand every little
thing in order to do something.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.788 align:middle line:90%
And it's always hubris.

00:07:58.788 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out everything
we think we understand,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
we probably don't really
understand all the details.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we feel like we
do, then we can take action.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:90%
So we're paralyzed.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But as a computer hacker, if I
want to gain entry to a system

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
or break it, I don't
need to know everything

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:90%
about how it works.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I need to know how it
responds to certain inputs,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.375 align:middle line:90%
and I can manipulate it.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we
do to our biology.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote the
definition of biohacking.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:84%
That just became a word in the
English definition last year.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.428 align:middle line:84%
Merriam-Webster has added
it to the dictionary.

00:08:27.428 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And biohacking is
the art and science

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
of changing the environment
around you and inside of you

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
by just changing things, so
you have your own biology

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
under your own control.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be fat.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.512 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be tired.

00:08:38.512 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be angry,
and cranky, and hypogly--

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
bitchy, and all the bad things
that I didn't choose but were

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:90%
happening to me.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.363 align:middle line:90%
They don't happen anymore.

00:08:47.363 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I set
up the world around me.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And I got rid of
the bad thinking

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional stuff and
went to a very deep level,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.555 align:middle line:84%
both emotionally,
spiritually, but physically.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We're responsible for our own
healing journey is essentially

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
what that means.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And a byproduct of getting
into traditional medicine,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
alternative medicine
is that you start

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
realizing how much power
has been taken away

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
from you by the current
system of medicine

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:90%
that we all find ourselves in.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It's our job.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
It's our job to know ourselves.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to be
able to feel ourselves.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to be on a constant
journey of experimentation,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
learning what we need
and what we don't need.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
at the core of what

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
we're suffering
from in our society

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
right now is this
disempowerment.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
We've given our power away to
people who don't even know us.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all
kinds of plants out there

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that have incredible
healing value.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
somewhere along the line,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:90%
we wrote them off.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.926 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:47.926 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Part of our distrust of
nature, maybe as human beings,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.663 align:middle line:84%
is we survive by not
eating the wrong stuff.

00:10:05.663 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we might
have this ingrained in us,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.307 align:middle line:84%
like a little bit of a distrust,
a little bit of awareness

00:10:10.307 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
around, just want-- you trust
in these plants and nature

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.815 align:middle line:84%
that we've never
experienced before.

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:18.633 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the people who
survived the genetic lines,

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that survive are the ones
that knew how to stay away

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
from poisonous foods and
how not to stray too far

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.200 align:middle line:90%
away from the fire.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So wandering into the
depths of the woods

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
to start experimenting
with these exotic plants

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
about is, almost

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
from a genetic
standpoint, wired into us,

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:90%
like, no, I don't know.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
No, this stuff all over here--
it might give me diabetes,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but I know it's not
necessarily poisonous.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So there are conservatively
80,000-plus species of plants

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.602 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon jungle alone.

00:10:51.602 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And that number
continues to go up.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It seems like every year
they're finding more.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though the jungle
is being burned down,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
they're finding even
more species of plants.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But of that 80,000 species of
plants, less than 3% of them

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
have been studied for
the medicinal value.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Of that 3%, a number
of modern medicines

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
have been synthesized--

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
3%.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we looking
at the other 97%?

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of the
world's rainforests.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.153 align:middle line:84%
25% of the most effective
cancer treatments

00:11:19.153 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
in hospitals are

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
derived from rainforest plants.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:90%
So why are we not looking?

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
exploring everything

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:90%
that nature has to offer?

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The only practical reason
that I can see is money.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.435 align:middle line:90%
You can't patent plants.

00:11:36.435 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:10%
So unless you can find something
that you can synthesize,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:10%
a constituent that can
be reproduced in a lab,

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:10%
there's no money to be made.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And medicine, as
we're all starting

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to see-- big pharma,
I think, is a concept

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that just about everyone
is aware of now.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It's money.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a big business.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So until we start
putting value on nature

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to
heal us, I don't

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
think we're going to see much
exploration of the other 97%

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:90%
of those plants.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't seem like a
wise business decision

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
for institutions that are
bent on making as much profit

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:90%
as they possibly can.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I like
the most about these plants

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not just
good at covering up symptoms.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:90%
They're curative.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They actually heal you as
opposed to enabling you to live

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%
with a health condition.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.807 align:middle line:90%
They have a curative effect.

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing about a lot
of the herbs that we use here

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:84%
at my house is that
they grow here.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.053 align:middle line:84%
And there's plants that are
extremely good for your body

00:12:32.053 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:90%
that grow on your front lawn.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I have dandelions
growing on my front lawn.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Dandelions are an
extreme medicinal.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We look at them as weeds,
but they are extremely

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:90%
good at detoxifying our liver.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:84%
They're something that's been
used for thousands of years

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:90%
to help our body heal itself.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And here they are, sprouting
up all over our lawns

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and asking for us to
start inviting them.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
My friend, Daniel
[? Atalis, ?] says

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that the herbs we need most
tend to sprout up around us.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And dandelions sprouting up
outside everyone's door here

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And guess what the most toxified
culture is in the world?

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Our diets are full of
toxins, pesticides.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, this medicine that's
the most perfect medicine

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that nature has to offer
us to detoxify our system

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.892 align:middle line:84%
is sprouting up everywhere,
asking us to eat it.

00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the more you
start dancing with herbs,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the more you start understanding
the subtleties of nature

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.427 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go
down to the Amazon.

00:13:26.427 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to travel
into the Sahara Desert

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to some far off oasis to
find the medicine you need.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times it's growing
in your neighborhood.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a class of
plant-based compounds called

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:90%
polyphenols.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And these are basically
the colored compounds

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
that are present in anything
that's brightly colored.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find a
reasonable amount of them

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:84%
in leafy green vegetables, and
fruit, and things like that,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:90%
but frankly, not that many.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Where they explode is
in herbs and spices.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So the more herbs and
spices you use, things

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
like rosemary,
oregano, thyme, fennel,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:84%
all those have masses
of these things.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
The average Westerner
gets about 1 gram

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
of these powerful plant-based
compounds in their food

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
if they're eating them,
just a regular diet.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're drinking coffee.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Coffee is the number one source
of polyphenols in the West.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.435 align:middle line:84%
The evidence is
that your cells can

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
work better when
they have enough

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:90%
of these plant-based compounds.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So I like these anti-aging
compounds and performance

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:90%
enhancing compounds.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Different polyphenols
do different things.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
makes us happy as humans

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:90%
is to perform better.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So no one likes to say, I cooked
dinner, and I did a crappy job.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Even if it wasn't necessary
you did a good job,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:90%
you just want to.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.827 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to do
something with excellence.

00:14:42.827 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we're attracted to

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
are things that enhance
human performance.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Fire enhances human performance.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.795 align:middle line:84%
A million years ago
there were two cavemen.

00:14:51.795 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, I'm
going to use fire to stay warm.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
said that's cheating.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The guy who said fire is
going to keep me warm-- he's

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
our ancestor.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
We have a built-in
innate desire to do that.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands of years,
probably tens of thousands

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
of years, really, we have been
using plant-based compounds

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is based
on direct observation

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
from people who use them
over multiple generations.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Mother
Nature smart drugs

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that are just endemic
out there that people

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
don't think of as smart drugs.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:10%
Number one, it's caffeine.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:10%
Coffee, tea, and chocolate.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Global wars have been
fought over these compounds.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They have fueled human progress.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The Enlightenment in Europe
was based on the explosion

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of coffee houses.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Civilization is tied
to these things.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:84%
You go back 5,000
years in China.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
There was tea.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And they tracked the different
grades and what they did.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And we knew this.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:90%
You go back in India--

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
tea.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Go back in Africa--

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:90%
coffee.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:90%
So this stuff has been around.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.228 align:middle line:84%
What's the other massive,
most studied smart drug

00:15:53.228 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that Mother Nature makes that
no one has ever heard of?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It's actually tobacco.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Smoking is terrible for you.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows smoking
is bad for you.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.873 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows it
makes you smell bad.

00:16:01.873 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It makes you look old and all
the bad stuff-- cancer, teeth

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:90%
falling out, whatever else.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
However, when people use
nicotine, they type 15% faster.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Their working memory improves.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:90%
They perform better.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are so wired
to perform better

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are willing to give up
the second half of our quality

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:90%
of life to feel good right now.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And emerging studies in the last
30 years shows from the 1980s

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that low doses of
purified nicotine

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:90%
reverse Alzheimer's disease.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what's
likely to kill you today

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.355 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the West,
it's diabetes, cancer,

00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, and
Alzheimer's disease.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
What if a very tiny amount of
nicotine on a daily basis not

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
only made you smarter, faster,
made your cells work better,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
but also reduce your
risk of Alzheimer's?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.687 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do not sell nicotine.

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
If I did, I wouldn't
be allowed to say that.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is
there is evidence of this.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
There's also evidence that large
doses of nicotine or smoking

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:90%
are just bad.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We can look at these plant-based
compounds and just understand.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel good.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:90%
We want to perform well.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Nature
will help us do it.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And plant-based compounds
are a big part of it.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:20.335 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.335 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When someone doesn't
know what's wrong with them

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and what's causing
their condition,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
they lose control
over their life.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't battle your enemy if
you don't know you have one.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's there wreaking
havoc, causing problems,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:90%
creating calamity.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:10%
But once your focus
is on to it, once you

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:10%
know it's not because
you're a bad person,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.485 align:middle line:10%
once you know it's not
because you're faulty,

00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:44.693 align:middle line:10%
once you know it's not
because it's all in your head,

00:17:44.693 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:10%
once you know you didn't
make it all up, once you know

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.712 align:middle line:10%
your body is not
attacking itself,

00:17:48.712 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:10%
and once you know it's
not because you're

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:10%
a genetic defect--

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I love that one.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Scientific research
wants to tell us

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
we're all genetically
now a problem.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:90%
It's talking about faulty.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
To begin with,
everybody has pathogens.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:90%
We're actually contracting them.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:90%
We're spreading them.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:90%
We get them when we're born.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
They're handed down to us
through our family line.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They come in all different
ways, shapes, and sizes.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.943 align:middle line:84%
Pathogens-- the
most important ones

00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that are actually plaguing
everybody right now

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:90%
today-- it's Epstein-Barr.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, Epstein-Barr has over 60
varieties of mutated viruses.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So there are mutations,
different strains.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
The shingles virus
has over 30 varieties.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
a rash to have it.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:84%
HHV-6 gets into the brain,
causes problems in the brain,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
causes kidney problems,
causes heart problems.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
HHV-7-- it's a whole
other virus there.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you have things
like Streptococcus.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Strep itself is
becoming a superbug.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:10%
It's behind chronic sinusitis,
chronic sinus headaches,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:10%
chronic sties, UTIs, SIBO--

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:10%
small intestinal bacteria
overgrowth, bloating,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:10%
constipation, Crohn's, celiac.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Strep is literally one of
those things that's becoming

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
the biggest problem right now.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not you.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault. You're
not the bad person here.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:90%
There is an answer.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's work on it.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Celery juice is not just a
vegetable that you juice.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Celery is an herb.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.868 align:middle line:84%
It's herbal medicine
when you extract it.

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a different thing
that happens with that alone.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
You eat a celery stick.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be the same
thing as if you juice it.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, this
medicine seems so simplistic.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.155 align:middle line:90%
How can it help anybody?

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It's this unbelievable
phenomenon

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.420 align:middle line:90%
that's occurring right now.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
there's millions

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
of people drinking it right
now, because it really works.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It actually really works.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The sodium cluster salts
in the celery juice strips

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
off the viral membrane
or the pathogen cover.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the sodium cluster
salt binds onto the pathogen

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to the bug and starts to
break it down, so it weakens.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It throws it off its game, so it
can't do what it normally does.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system is trying
to actually protect you

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:90%
from pathogens.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It's looking for them.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The pathogens can
harbor themselves

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the most sneakiest of
places inside the body.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.095 align:middle line:84%
And they can avoid your
immune system very easily.

00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:10%
But they can't avoid
the sodium cluster

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:10%
salts that are circulating
through your whole entire body.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The liver holds onto all
these different pathogens

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:90%
to try to protect you.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It holds onto
mercury and copper.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
people who are suffering

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with eczema and psoriasis
and really bad bouts of skin

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
disorders--

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:84%
that's because they're high
in copper inside the liver

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and they've got a viral issue.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And a viral issue is
feeding off of the copper

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:90%
releasing a derma toxin.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
That derma toxin floats
up through the skin

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and gives them their
eczema and psoriasis.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And getting them out
of bouts of eczema

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and psoriasis-- they have
to be on celery juice.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It takes the copper out.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It stops the virus over time.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It's cleaning up the liver.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:90%
It's cleansing the body.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.573 align:middle line:90%
It's detoxifying the body.

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It's supporting
the immune system.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's making you
stronger in many ways.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's doing all these things.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.515 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.515 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is when
you're feeling good,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.348 align:middle line:84%
and you're on it every
day, and you can't quite

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
tell what it's doing for you,
do it for a month or two months

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and then stop.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll know it's
been doing something for you.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:39.722 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:43.138 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:48.538 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us think of
the lowly rodents like not

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
so intelligent, but then you
look at the beaver who has this

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.178 align:middle line:90%
tremendous engineering ability.

00:21:57.178 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
This was a much
wetter landscape,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
because beavers held
water on the landscape

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
by constructing
extremely elaborate dams.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that
they pile sticks up.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They excavate mud
and stones, which

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.817 align:middle line:90%
they use in their construction.

00:22:15.817 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.334 align:middle line:84%
They are incredibly studious
about their environment.

00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And they know how to
construct dams to hold water

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:10%
to create wetland habitats.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
When we watch what
they do, it's like, oh,

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
they create more
species diversity.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They create more edge habitat,
which lots of animals use.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
They create the wetlands that
bring in migratory birds.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing how
they create more habitat.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:90%
People do this, too.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.651 align:middle line:84%
We are a type of animal
that engineers landscapes.

00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Even as indigenous
people, pre-agricultural,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
pre-industrial,
indigenous peoples

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:84%
were burning landscapes with
fire to create open space,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.385 align:middle line:84%
sometimes just to get
away from biting insects.

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes you
burn a landscape

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:90%
to bring up new growth.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people imagine
that for hunter-gatherers,

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that they would have to move
because they depleted the food

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.807 align:middle line:90%
resources.

00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually go out
and play with some of this,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
you realize, well, you probably
are actually reducing your fuel

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
before your food.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.392 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
running out of stuff

00:23:36.392 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to burn, especially
prior to metal tools.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
When Europeans came to North
America, it was essentially,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:84%
we could say, the
Stone Age here.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:90%
They did not have metal tools.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you are cutting a
tree down with an axe that's

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:90%
a stone head, right?

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:90%
You have to make that.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we're not talking
about a cutting blade

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:90%
that you just easily resharpen.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely
to want to burn

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
wood that's already fallen, wood
that's washed up on shore, wood

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that can be snapped off lower
limbs, things like that, that

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
are dry on conifers
and things like that.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.502 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
run out of that.

00:24:10.502 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But as you go through
the landscape doing that,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:84%
you start breaking
that stuff off.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You're opening up
all this space.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Air moves in there.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Animals can now
move through there.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:90%
You cut stuff down.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And young shoots come up.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And deer, moose, elk
come in for that stuff.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:10%
So we actually
engineered landscapes

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and then we'd move along, and
move along, and move along.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And as we did that, nature
became more productive.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:10%
There's a story I really like
out of the Christian Bible

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:10%
or, I guess, out
of Torah as well,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.070 align:middle line:10%
this idea that the first
people were put into a garden

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.890 align:middle line:10%
to be the gardeners of it,
to name all the animals

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:10%
and to care for the garden.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
really universally true

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
in there is that humans--

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
essentially what we are is
the self-aware gardeners

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:90%
of the wild world.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when we went
down this path of domestication

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:90%
that we lost that.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are like the
antithesis of that.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We have gone from being
gardeners to being

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:90%
just like the harvesters of it.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're eating our
way down the food chain.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So we started off
with the big stuff--

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
sperm whales, cod.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting down to where
we're harvesting the seaweeds.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all that's left.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:90%
We ate down through it, right?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an inverted
trophic scale where

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:90%
we took all the big stuff.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when that was gone,
we took the next thing.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.225 align:middle line:84%
And when that was going,
took the next thing.

00:25:25.225 --> 00:25:27.177 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
running out of stuff.

00:25:27.177 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:90%
We're eating our way through it.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
We've become the opposite
of what we are meant to be.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.885 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

00:25:33.885 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
important for people to get.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.645 align:middle line:84%
This idea of a lunar
base or a trip to Mars--

00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking
about something

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.103 align:middle line:90%
that's going on next week.

00:25:42.103 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
We have no backup plan.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
This is the womb.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
This Earth is what we have.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.473 align:middle line:84%
We need to bank on
protecting this place,

00:25:51.473 --> 00:25:53.765 align:middle line:84%
not running somewhere else
and then destroying that one

00:25:53.765 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and going to the next one.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
do that, we need

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.437 align:middle line:84%
to have a different
ethic with how

00:25:58.437 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:90%
we interact with the landscape.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to come
from just recycling and trying

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to do-- leave no trace
in the environment.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come
from people having

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:84%
meaningful interactions with
the landscape that can't

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.353 align:middle line:90%
be replaced by something else.

00:26:14.353 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:10%
You could look at
what I do, which

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:10%
is hunt, fish, and forage food.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:10%
You can think it's a hobby,
because I don't really need to.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I can right down
to the supermarket.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I have the resources.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I have a vehicle.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I have the money to go
buy all my food if I want.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But I choose to hunt,
fish, and forage.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It looks to some
people like it's

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:84%
my hobby, like, oh, it's just
golf, or Frisbee, or whatever

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:90%
other hobby.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it's like, no.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a sport.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.503 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best way to say
it, it's like a practice.

00:26:46.503 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Most people who meditate don't
think that their meditation

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:90%
is a sport, right?

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't think of their
yoga usually as a sport.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice, right?

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
to show up and do it.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, harvesting and
processing your own food

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.340 align:middle line:90%
takes quite a lot of discipline.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It provides subsistence.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It provides calories for me.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But I spend probably
sometimes more resources

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:90%
doing it than I actually get.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's not really subsistence.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
a sport or a hobby.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice that alters
how I interact with landscapes.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I move
through landscapes,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:90%
these are like a kitchen to me.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like an extension of me.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my home.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.485 align:middle line:84%
If Walmart wants to put
a store into a landscape

00:27:30.485 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
where I harvest food, who's
the first person out there

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to say, hey, no, this place
needs to remain an open space?

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Not the "environmentalist"
back in the city,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
who is just actually
using all those resources

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and probably going to
shop at that Walmart.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
For sure, they believe in
caring for the environment,

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:84%
but at such a level
of removal that they

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.307 align:middle line:84%
can fall into these ideas of
carbon offset credits, right?

00:27:58.307 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like, oh,
yeah, that makes sense.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.613 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll destroy that, but
we'll fix something over here,

00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
whereas I'm like, no,
you can't destroy.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That is important.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:90%
I fish there.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I hunt there.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I get my food there.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a stakeholder in
caring for that landscape.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And what I've noticed
is when people

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:10%
have these meaningful,
sustainably

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:10%
extractive relationships,
they care about a place.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
about indigenous people.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.613 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you become a
staunch protector of a place,

00:28:24.613 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
once you have a meaningful
interaction with the landscape.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I say meaningful,
I mean my cells in my body

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:84%
contain carbon that come
from a hundred plants

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
off this landscape
and a dozen animals

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that I have personally
harvested and eaten.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I am made of those things.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I will protect them.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They're like family
and friends to me.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not the way people
feel about their food

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:90%
at the supermarket.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:10%
If people can go
on a plant walk,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:10%
if they can learn to
make just a cup of tea

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.322 align:middle line:10%
from something that grows around
them, that's how you start.

00:28:55.322 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't start by
going, I'm going

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.392 align:middle line:84%
to go out, and go on, and
do a moose hunt, right?

00:28:59.392 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Or something like that.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to buy a boat and
go lobstering or something

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I'm going to
take some dandelion leaves

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.725 align:middle line:84%
and make some tea that's going
to be good for my kidneys.

00:29:08.725 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
good for my liver.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.377 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to--

00:29:11.377 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
more than that, it's going
to be good for my soul,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to know
that I have just created

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with a species.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, every time
I see a dandelion,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
it's more than just a yellow
blot on the landscape.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a friend of mine.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.448 align:middle line:90%
And I work with that friend.

00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting, too, when

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you start to get back to
who these species are,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
not just what they look like,
who they are, where they live,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:90%
how they behave.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And you become part of that.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there are
some definite allies in this

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.910 align:middle line:84%
philosophy of everything as
medicine to make it more doable

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.990 align:middle line:90%
to get started on.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:90%
One of them is using herbs.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use a category
of herbs called adaptogens

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
that are known to be great at
modulating stress in the body.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I eat reishi mushroom
on a regular basis.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I put it in tinctures.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I make teas out of it.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It helps me do things that
I wouldn't-- otherwise be

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable without doing,
like step onto a stage in front

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
and talk about shamanism,

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:90%
let's just say.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The right plant ally will
give you a subtle advantage.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It'll help keep your system
in a state of homeostasis,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:84%
even when the
environment around you

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.310 align:middle line:90%
gets a little bit more intense.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend
starting to use herbs

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and finding that right
subtle herb for you.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's reishi mushroom.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's another herb called
skullcap and a third called

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.566 align:middle line:90%
ashwagandha.

00:30:39.566 --> 00:30:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
own unique qualities,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and they are perfect for
my own unique physiology.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there's some
things you can't get past.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely evolve
as a spirit, as a soul,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:90%
at least in my eyes.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Some things genetically
are just there.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So how do you use
herbs to try to right

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.893 align:middle line:84%
some of the genetic expressions
that might not be helping you?

00:31:02.893 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So herbalists look
at this and they say,

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
well, a lot of times
our external environment

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:90%
mimics our internal environment.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So in the woods, if we're
looking at a stream,

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
what plants are growing
close to the most rough parts

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:90%
of that stream?

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And what could they
possibly be good for?

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.273 align:middle line:84%
So I've had it told me by a
couple of different herbalists

00:31:20.273 --> 00:31:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that the reason
why skullcap works

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the mental
chatter in your brain,

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
is closely synced up to exactly
what it's doing on that stream.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It loves to grow right
near a lot of babbling,

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:90%
a lot of extra energy happening.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
take skullcap, it

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
has this way of
not pacifying you.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in any way
dulling your senses.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:84%
But it just somehow
quiets the noise.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here has a
ticker tape of thought

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
running across
their consciousness

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
behind their eyeballs
at all times.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
even the best meditators

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world, the masters--

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
they know it's real.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:58.612 align:middle line:90%
They're not beyond it.

00:31:58.612 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:90%
They've learned to accept it.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.862 align:middle line:90%
And they can turn it off.

00:32:00.862 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And they can be OK with
it when it comes back on.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.857 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there.

00:32:03.857 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be some
kind of ticker tape of thought.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And so getting an advantage
on that ticker tape

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, through
herbs, other practices,

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I think is a huge part of
living this life of purpose

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the world
as ripe with medicine.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:90%
There's a shaman in the jungle.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.680 align:middle line:90%
His name is Habeen.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
He's a tobacco shaman
which, to a lot of people,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely ludicrous.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait, tobacco shaman?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.798 align:middle line:84%
You smoke cigarettes
and you get better?

00:32:33.798 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Tobacco is a sacred
plant down there.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's used in a
bunch of different ways.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And used medicinally,
it's extremely powerful.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was leaving the jungle
last time I was down there,

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
he and I were having
a coca ceremony.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:90%
We're chewing coca leaves.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.747 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, I don't
understand these Westerners.

00:32:52.747 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
They come down here.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They want us to heal
them like we're a surgeon

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:84%
or we operate by
the same principles

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.645 align:middle line:84%
that their weird
medicine operates by.

00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
He's like, that's
not what we do.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:84%
He's like, they've
got it all wrong.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:84%
A shaman doesn't
heal his patient.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
A shaman merely
clears the blocks

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that are preventing the patient
from healing themselves.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And that to me is--

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
it just changed the way
I looked at everything.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:84%
In these older traditions,
there's much more

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:84%
emphasis placed on
spiritual wellness, whatever

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.220 align:middle line:90%
spirit means to you.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It's different for
everybody, but just

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that internal world of yours.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:84%
That isn't really taken
into consideration

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.185 align:middle line:84%
by modern medicine, is at the
heart of all these traditions.

00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason why.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:84%
When you go into a
lot of these cultures,

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a baseline thing
you should be doing

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
or that you're told to do to
clean the slate, so to speak,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.797 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, to get the
garbage out of your brain,

00:34:03.797 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
out of your heart, out
of your energy fields

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:84%
before you start
working with herbs

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:90%
and other different techniques.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
In the Amazon, it's ayahuasca.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps to
dissolve your ego,

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
so you can be more receptive
to the subtle herbs

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.767 align:middle line:84%
and a whole host of other
different visionary plants.

00:34:23.767 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Something that fascinates
me about ayahuasca

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that is one of those mysteries
that can't really be explained

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:84%
is that ayahuasca
is a combination

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:90%
of two different plants.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a vine called
the Banisteriopsis caapi.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
plant called chacruna.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The Banisteriopsis
is an MAO inhibitor

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
or it contains MAO
inhibitor constituents.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the chacruna is
a DMT rich plant.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.810 align:middle line:84%
You combine them
and you boil them

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.535 align:middle line:90%
together for a number of hours.

00:34:51.535 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then that turns into this
extremely psychoactive brew

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that has been used in the
Amazon for thousands of years.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Makes sense, except for the fact
that the Banisteriopsis caapi

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:90%
vine--

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.140 align:middle line:90%
it grows way over here.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.413 align:middle line:84%
And the chacruna plant
is just a little leaf.

00:35:10.413 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It looks like any other
possible leaf in the jungle.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing fancy about it.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a
normal ivy leaf.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It grows 500 to 1,000 miles
away in a different ecosystem.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.450 align:middle line:90%
How is it that these people--

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
how would they know to harvest
that Banisteriopsis caapi vine,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
harvest this one little
leaf over here and brew them

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
together when there's,
like we said before,

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
80,000-plus species
of plants in between?

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:10%
This is really interesting.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:10%
Did these people try every
single plant combination?

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.220 align:middle line:84%
There'd be a lot of
deaths if they did that.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Or was there some other
deeper connection to the Earth

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're just starting
to tap back into?

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I went down to Peru
before ayahuasca was cool.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
For about a day or
so, I drank the stuff.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And I came out of it.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had this uplifting,
dreamlike experience.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It just felt really good,
better than I'd had in a while.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I've used
ayahuasca three times.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And each time has been
completely different.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
The common thread
between every time

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:84%
was, we can try to
hide things, which is

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:90%
what the subconscious is doing.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
everything is revealed.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Everything is being
seen all the time.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
can't really hide it.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And we come into
these physical bodies.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we think, oh, I've got to
hide this from everyone else.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you're
actually not really hiding.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:90%
You think you are.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's been an
amazing medicine for me.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's allowed me
to be more transparent

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and to actually be able
to look at pain more.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized
it's important to look.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the greatest lessons

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
from ayahuasca, to actually,
really open your eyes

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.977 align:middle line:84%
and look at what's there
so that it can transmute.

00:37:06.977 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
not looking at it,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're closing
your eyes to it,

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
or pretending it's not
there, it's still there,

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:84%
yet it's creating chaos
underneath the surface for you.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> From my own experiences
with ayahuasca,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
a really intense ayahuasca
ceremony is going to reveal all

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:84%
the negative self-talk that has
been running behind the scenes

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:84%
for the last month,
year of your life.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.480 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see it, but
not just see it, like, oh,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:90%
look at that.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I probably shouldn't
say that to myself anymore.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man, I'm really not a phony.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Or, man, I'm really
not unworthy.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm really not some jerk
who thinks that he's somebody.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That's not how
you experience it.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
You experience it by being
thrown into a petri dish

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with that one type of
thought for a while

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how damaging it is

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and how uncomfortable it
can be in your entire being.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're experiencing
those thoughts as opposed

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
to just passively seeing them
and trying to get rid of them.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
You're actually thrown into
these different emotions,

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:15.750 align:middle line:84%
these different feelings
of pain or discomfort

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with that
negative self-talk that's

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.592 align:middle line:90%
been running in the background.

00:38:19.592 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can spend a whole evening
just suffering, going from one,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
figuring it out, clearing it,
having a moment of like, oh,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
my gosh.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.485 align:middle line:84%
That's gone now,
but then getting

00:38:30.485 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:90%
thrown into the next one.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
from my perspective.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.877 align:middle line:84%
And it's also what I
know from hearing a bunch

00:38:37.877 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of other people's stories.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.367 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has a different
experience with it.

00:38:41.367 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't have a
hard time with ayahuasca.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll be a
completely different plant.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So for me, ayahuasca
is kryptonite.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.600 align:middle line:90%
I take it.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And it is going to be suffering.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.533 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming up,
out the other end.

00:38:53.533 --> 00:38:56.477 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to feel
incredible afterward.

00:38:56.477 --> 00:38:59.606 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.606 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:84%
We made a phone call
to Sacred Science.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
Amazonian shamanism.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.480 align:middle line:84%
We took eight patients
from around the world

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:84%
who were really ill with a wide
array of diseases from cancer,

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to Parkinson's,
to drug addiction,

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
down to the middle of nowhere
on the border of Peru and Brazil

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:84%
to work with shamans and
their medicines for 30 days.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
coolest things that I

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
think we saw as filmmakers
down in the Amazon

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
was that beyond the crazy
number of medicinal plants

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that they use and beyond
these amazing and mysterious

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
visionary potions that they use
like ayahuasca, the answer is

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot more boring than what I
think people wanted to hear,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.780 align:middle line:84%
which is there is this really
close connection to nature.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Our patients that
we brought down--

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.830 align:middle line:84%
they were all excited about
all these different rites

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of passage they
were to go through.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.685 align:middle line:84%
And we had all
different kinds of walks

00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of life-- people who
were afraid of nature,

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.490 align:middle line:90%
people who loved nature.

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But everybody came down
with all their devices.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were not
expecting what we

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.050 align:middle line:84%
were going to do when they
got there, which was take away

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.327 align:middle line:84%
every electronic device they
had, every book they brought.

00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Anything else besides their
clothes and their core needs

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.702 align:middle line:90%
was taken away from them.

00:40:13.702 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were politely
walked a mile into the jungle

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and ushered into their
personal dieta hut, which

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.548 align:middle line:84%
is a one-room hut in
the middle of nowhere

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to be
by yourself for 30 days.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.638 align:middle line:84%
So people struggled
with the diet.

00:40:30.638 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
People struggled a little
bit with the ayahuasca.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But no one struggled
with anything

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
as much as the isolation
in a jungle hut

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%
without your pacifiers or
your electronic devices

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to help you ignore what's
going on in your psyche, what's

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:84%
going on in your reality,
what's going on in your body.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the coolest
things I guess

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I learned down in the Amazon
was the simplicity of life.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The removal of all of
the distraction that we

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
have here in the Western
world, in the developed world

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.927 align:middle line:84%
is a huge part of
the healing process.

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't escape yourself when
you're in the middle of nowhere

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle with no one to
talk to, and no news to read,

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and no Facebook
feed to check out.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's about a seven
or eight-day window there

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.320 align:middle line:90%
where it's agonizing for people.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's ugly.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.315 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to watch.

00:41:19.315 --> 00:41:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to give them
their phone back.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.708 align:middle line:84%
Because taking that phone
away from somebody--

00:41:23.708 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:84%
it seems so innocent, like,
oh, yeah, this is just my--

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I just use this to talk, do
business, and call my friends.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's not that anymore.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:90%
It's everything now.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's helping
us avoid ourselves.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Avoiding ourselves means
avoiding your own healing path.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There's weird
stuff that happens,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.893 align:middle line:84%
whether it's happening
all in your own mind,

00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:84%
or in the universe around
you, or the underworld.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
you want to call it.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say my data
set is that there's

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
interesting stuff out there that
isn't easy to see or detect,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
but that people I know
from different lineages,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:84%
including ancient
Chinese medicine,

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
including South American things,
Native American religions.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And they all seem to see and
report and say the same things.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, just
as a scientist, what's

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that first step of
the scientific method?

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Observe, OK?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:90%
So I see this.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a pattern.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.737 align:middle line:90%
You can hypothesize.

00:42:15.737 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it works.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I can make up lots of
stories and test them, right?

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.512 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
through and you test.

00:42:20.512 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is when
I do shamanic work,

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I am better at what I do.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I like my life better.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca was a
meaningful part of that.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And since that time,
I've done very deep work

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.350 align:middle line:90%
with neurofeedback.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I have had very
similar experiences

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to ayahuasca from deep, deep
meditation with a computer

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.310 align:middle line:90%
helping me do it.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I've had even deeper
experiences than ayahuasca

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.200 align:middle line:84%
from specific breathing
exercises called

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.610 align:middle line:90%
holotropic breathing.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.488 align:middle line:84%
And we have an innate drive
and need to leave our bodies

00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and experience the world
around us in an altered state.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It's part of being a human.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And so ayahuasca, for me,
was one of the first things

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that I tried that really opened
my eyes to the fact that, wow,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:08.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can simultaneously be
a rational computer scientist,

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:84%
engineering, entrepreneur,
Wharton MBA guy.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can also accept in
the world of shamanic stuff

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
there's spirit
animals, and spirits,

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and whatever other
auras and energy fields.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
They can both exist.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.838 align:middle line:84%
This is the rational
side of my brain,

00:43:23.838 --> 00:43:24.880 align:middle line:90%
and it works really well.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the irrational
side of reality.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:28.277 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to work
really well, too.

00:43:28.277 --> 00:43:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to fight
between them anymore.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I can effortlessly
move between the two.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And being able to do
something like ayahuasca

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
was, for me, really helpful
just to look inside a world

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't even
think existed.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.472 align:middle line:84%
>> But in other traditions,
it could be a sweat lodge.

00:43:41.472 --> 00:43:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Sweat lodge-- for me, it brings
up a lot of the same things

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that an ayahuasca ceremony does.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
made part of the missed

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.180 align:middle line:84%
messaging around the
spirit pathway now,

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.930 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to
go down to the Amazon.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Or you need to go into
some remote culture

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and have the experience with a
shaman or the high priestess.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:84%
When looking at
traditions here in America

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that were here long
before we got here,

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.750 align:middle line:90%
things like the sweat lodge--

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:90%
they trigger the same stuff.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
A really intense
sweat lodge can be

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
just as or more transformational
than an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
What we've noticed is,
in these traditions,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:84%
the real rites of passage are
planned intensity of some kind,

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:84%
so planned intensity of
heat in a sweat lodge,

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.580 align:middle line:84%
planned intensity of your
entire psyche melting down,

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
which is an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just, how are
you going to do--

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to be in your
soul when the world around you

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.118 align:middle line:84%
melts away and you have to deal
with suffering for a while?

00:44:45.118 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what ayahuasca is.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what a sweat lodge is.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what a bunch of different
types of practices in the Far

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.125 align:middle line:90%
East are.

00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And doing that beforehand
or in conjunction

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:84%
with herbal protocols and
energy healing protocols

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.940 align:middle line:90%
is what we see most.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Every ancient religion had a
process and a practice of doing

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.440 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that was
necessary for human evolution.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't changed.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it with
plant-based medicines.

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a rich
history of that.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.840 align:middle line:84%
There are also faster and deeper
forms of meditation-- shamanic

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.880 align:middle line:90%
drumming, breathing exercises.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to use long
distance running?

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Fasting for days?

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.140 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is in.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You must do something
to separate yourself

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
from your meat, so you can be
more aware of what's going on.

>> And I think that there is
this overall disconnection from

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.785 align:middle line:84%
nature that's at the heart of a
lot of what we're going through

00:45:48.785 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We see wildness as a
threatening external force,

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.370 align:middle line:84%
rather than a thing
that we're a part of.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think mentally
unwinding-- that's

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:01.425 align:middle line:84%
a really important part of
getting back to some sanity.

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If we were more
connected to nature,

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't do a lot
of what we're doing.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be creating the
waste that we're creating.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
supporting the brands

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that we support, because
we'd be mortified at the fact

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that they were
deforesting this planet.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:19.923 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.923 --> 00:46:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone in the
world should be using herbs.

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.923 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that
everyone in the world

00:46:23.923 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:84%
should be using
psychoactive plants.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's up to
us knowing ourselves,

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.328 align:middle line:90%
knowing what we're ready for.

00:46:31.328 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:84%
It's an individual
journey, goes back

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.472 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of
personal empowerment.

00:46:34.472 --> 00:46:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not what your doctor
tells you what to do.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not what the
shaman asks you to do.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not what your friends
think is a good idea,

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's what you
think you're ready for.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> After that, it's starting
to develop meaningful

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:84%
relationships with
the natural world.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that comes from
getting to know species.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So in my environment,
let's say I know

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:90%
several dozen plants, animals.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those is
like a friend of mine.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So we could take a walk
through these woods.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's say
you're not from here

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.258 align:middle line:84%
and you're not familiar
with what's here.

00:47:05.258 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So everything is just green
and brown going past you.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
something unrelated to nature,

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the backdrop
as if the natural world

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
is the stage upon
which we act out

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.470 align:middle line:84%
the human drama versus
the place where we live.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing
individuals in that blur.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:90%
That's beech tree.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:90%
That's birch tree.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:27.250 align:middle line:90%
That's maple.

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just that's maple.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.400 align:middle line:84%
That's maple whom
all of my sugars

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:84%
come from when I make my maple
syrup to provide all my sugar

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.020 align:middle line:90%
resources for the year.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:90%
That's birch.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I extract a syrup
from that, that I

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:84%
use to marinate all my
fishing before I smoke them.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And I cut the twigs
to clean my teeth.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a host to several
species of mushroom like chaga

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So when I see a birch
tree, it's not like,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, just a birch tree.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.617 align:middle line:84%
It has layers and
layers of meaning to me.

00:47:54.617 --> 00:47:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And then that's true
of the forbs around me,

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and the grasses around me,
and the species of animals

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:02.198 align:middle line:90%
that I rely on for food.

00:48:02.198 --> 00:48:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting, too, when

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.990 align:middle line:84%
you start to get back to
who these species are,

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:84%
not just what they look like,
who they are, where they live,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.123 align:middle line:90%
how the way they behave.

00:48:11.123 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And you become part of that.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's about making
distinctions, moving slowly.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:26.010 align:middle line:84%
We live in a culture
of convenience,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.330 align:middle line:90%
a culture of the quick fix.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.830 align:middle line:90%
We want results now.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We want a good time now.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.420 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel better now.

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.750 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything that
the traditional healing

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:84%
path has taught me is
that it's not about that.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about improvement every
single day, one step at a time,

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
learning how to enjoy the
process, make distinctions.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:84%

better before you know it.
