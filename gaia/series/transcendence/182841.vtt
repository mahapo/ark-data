00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.905 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a corporate lawyer
working 60 to 80-hour weeks

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:14.705 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:10%
I had spent the better
part of my life chasing

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
that American dream without ever
really thinking about what I

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:10%
wanted to do with my life.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't taking care
of myself physically.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
I'd become a junk food addict.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
I was not exercising at all.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:10%
I was 50 pounds overweight,
and I have a history

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:10%
of addiction and alcoholism.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:10%
I was also very depressed.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And it all caught
up to me shortly

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:10%
before my 40th birthday.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:10%
Late one evening as
I was making my way

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:10%
up a simple flight of stairs,
I literally had to pause.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:10%
I was so winded.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:10%
I had tightness in my chest
and shortness of breath

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:10%
and sweat on my brow and
really, like, fear in my heart

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.745 align:middle line:10%
that I was on the precipice
of having a heart incident.

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:10%
My whole life, my
mother would say,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:10%
you got to watch what
you eat and be careful,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.510 align:middle line:10%
but it all became very crystal
clear to me in that moment,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:10%
not only that I needed to
change how I was living,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:10%
how I was behaving,
how I was prioritizing

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:10%
my time and my energy,
but also that I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
wanted to make that change.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a willingness to
take a leap of faith

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.937 align:middle line:90%
and try something different.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I did was
a seven-day fruit and vegetable

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
juice cleanse, which
was crazy at the time.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.625 align:middle line:84%
It was so out of left field from
anything I'd ever experienced.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd never gone a single
day in my entire life

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
without eating solid food.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that that was
something that would kind

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:90%
of shock me out of my habits.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to do with
detoxing or any of that.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to do something
extreme to kind of reframe

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
my relationship with food,
and it was very effective

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
in that regard.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Over that seven-day
period, I can

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
remember lying on the couch,
being listless and sweating

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, how am I going
to make it through the day?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But the remarkable
thing is that at the end

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
of that one-week week period,
I felt completely revitalized.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.767 align:middle line:84%
I had a resurgence of vitality
and energy and mental clarity

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.975 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't experienced
since I was a young person.

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.078 align:middle line:84%
And I had all this
energy for the first time

00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:90%
in as long as I could remember.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So the impulse to actually
move myself physically

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
occurred to me,
which is something

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't felt in a while also.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I started exercising
again, first very casually.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But I realized very quickly
that I enjoyed that,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.222 align:middle line:84%
and it was a big part of
what I was about as a child

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and something that
I love very much

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and had really
lost touch with it.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think what it evolved
into was this pursuit of trying

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%
to unlock hidden potential.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:10%
In a very short period
of time after changing

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:10%
my relationship with food, I
had completely transformed.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:10%
I lost 50 pounds.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:10%
I looked different.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:10%
I felt different.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:10%
It was quite radical, and
yet the changes that I made

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:10%
were relatively simple.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And the thought
occurred to me, if I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
could change this
drastically, this dramatically

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
in such a short
period of time, what

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
are the other areas of my life
that I'm overlooking where I'm

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
sitting on top of
mountains of potential

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just not
consciously aware of?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what lured me
into the world of triathlon

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
initially and ultimately into
ultra endurance athletics

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
because I was a
swimmer in college,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
so I had that
background, and I knew

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:90%
how to train and push myself.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I sort of got
fitter and more invested

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
in this food adventure
that I was on,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I started getting more
interested in fitness

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had unfinished business
as a competitive swimmer,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and I never felt like I achieved
my potential as an athlete.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And so here I was
at 40, 41 years old

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
having this kind of renaissance
experience and thinking, well,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can be
competitive again.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's give this a go.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I read this article about
this crazy race, Ultraman,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:84%
which is a double Ironman
distance triathlon that

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
circumnavigates the entire
big island of Hawaii

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
over three days.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
It's 320 miles.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely bananas.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It was like a light switch went
off in my mind and I thought,

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
that's the race for me.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not logical at all.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It was more like this bizarre
calling that I felt. Like,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
it just felt right.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
what I'm doing,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and I could see
myself, in my mind,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:90%
lining up at the start line.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was going to happen.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like a foregone
conclusion despite the fact

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that it made no
sense whatsoever.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had one goal, and
that goal was don't die.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't set goals or
define success based on our own

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
self-identity but based on
what I call the culturescape.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The culturescape is that
tangled web of rituals, habits,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, mythologies,
practices that our culture,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
our religions, our
countries, through schooling,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
through education,
through media,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
infuse us in terms of
what is the right way

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.473 align:middle line:90%
to function in the world.

00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, post-World War
II, the culturescape

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
was really about rebuilding,
about being safe.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But in today's
world, we are safe.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so in today's world,
the millennial generation,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
the big thing that they want
to pursue is self-discovery,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:90%
is creation.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, the culturescape
keeps engulfing us and telling

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
us that we need
a college degree,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
we need to get a good career,
we need to work the 9:00 to 5:00

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
so we can make partner
in that law firm

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
so we can have 2.5 cars in the
garage, a wife, and two kids

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
so that someday when we are 60,
we can finally retire and see

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, those
rules don't apply anymore.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The culturescape was
designed to keep us safe.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But it was never designed
to keep us happy.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:10%
>> We were taught in the
'80s and the '90s, which is

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:10%
basically consumerism, which
was lean on other things,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:10%
which was attain power,
money, wealth, status,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:10%
and you'll feel good--

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:10%
but you have an
entire economy now

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:10%
that's chugged along pretty
well for decade after decade

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:10%
after decade.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lot of comfort,
especially in the United States

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and the Western worlds now.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We haven't solved
all the problems.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of still people
living in just abject poverty.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But as more and more of the
world reaches middle class,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
then they fought to get there,
then they kind of look around

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:90%
go, is this it?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I still don't feel good.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I still feel like I
did when I was broke.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I still feel like I did
when I was struggling.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And people are having trouble
connecting with themselves.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> As Henry David Thoreau said
so eloquently, I truly believe,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
"the mass of men lead lives
of quiet desperation,"

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and "what is considered
resignation is confirmed

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.725 align:middle line:90%
desperation."

00:07:20.725 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
I think it was true in his time.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
more true now.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:10%
There are so many people who are
dissatisfied with their lives.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
They're living their lives
reactively, compulsively,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and not mindfully
or consciously.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's really not
even their own fault.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We are living all in
this system that's

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:84%
set up to drive us
onto career paths

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're not consciously
choosing for ourselves

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.537 align:middle line:84%
or that are out of alignment
with who we truly are.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But we take goals
that belong to society.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.078 align:middle line:84%
We take goals that
belong to our parents.

00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:10%
We take goals that
we think and justify

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.913 align:middle line:10%
and rationalize that we
need in order to be happy.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
reaching the pinnacle

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of these mountains, the mountain
being a metaphor for life.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'd reached this
pinnacle, and I'd

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
stand on the top this mountain
and look around and go,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would
feel different.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.748 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd be happy or I
thought I'd be more content.

00:08:13.748 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd look
across the horizon.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.998 align:middle line:84%
I'd see another mountain
in the distance.

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd go, ah, here's the problem,
I climbed the wrong mountain.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I climb that
mountain in the distance,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.243 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be happy.

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would come down
off this, mountain

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.225 align:middle line:90%
and I'd cross the valley.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, this valley
represented years of my life

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.808 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'd climb another
mountain, which

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.720 align:middle line:84%
represented another business,
another financial goal,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
another material goal, or
even a relationship goal.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd get to the top of that, and
the same pattern followed me.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I just
stop and ask myself,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
why, when I achieve
something, is it not enough?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Hunter S. Thompson,
the American writer,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
in 1953 was asked to write
a letter to a friend.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
His friend was
asking for advice.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Hunter says, the danger
with goal setting

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is very often the goals that
you set are not your goals.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:84%
They are the
culturescape's definition

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of how you are meant to
be safe in the world.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But that is one of the
sure response to misery,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to waking up one day
at the age of 40 going,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
what the hell
happened to my life?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we always
have to question.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the keys to setting
goals that are really going

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
to be incredible for you
is, do they excite you?

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at them on
that piece of paper,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
does it bring you to life?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Does it bring you joy?

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.253 align:middle line:84%
Does it make you have
those little mix of fear

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and anticipation,
and you're like,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
you can't wait to
dive into them?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
If not, something's
probably wrong.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we're setting goals out
of fear or a place of pain,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
that's not necessarily bad.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
We can either change
our lives from a space

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:90%
of inspiration or desperation.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us hit a pain
point where we're suffering,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:90%
we're depressed.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We have hit this
place in our lives,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it's emotionally
in a relationship,

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
financially in our careers,
where something is not working.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves
feeling like we're beating

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:90%
our head against a wall.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're setting a goal out of
I can't take this pain anymore,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that's not necessarily
bad because we

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
have to start where we are.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
looking at your goals,

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
if they don't make you
want to jump out of bed,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
stay up all night,
just get so fired up

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
about figuring out how to
bring them into the world,

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
then I think it's time
for some re-evaluation.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people
set goals based on what

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
their family or their
peers want them to do.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's good if it's
also what you want to do.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
people chase things

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that they don't fully
love, and so they're

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.655 align:middle line:90%
living someone else's life.

00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think you
got to figure out,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.447 align:middle line:84%
what are the things that brings
you the most joy, the most

00:10:45.447 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
passion, the most meaning?

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it was simple
as I just love jumping

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
into a swimming pool in the
morning or I love the feeling

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
of how the sun hits my shoulder
on a trail run at dawn.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Those were things I wanted
to have more of in my life--

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
very simple, basic, ultimately
quite primal instincts.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
2008 was my first
Ultraman, and I

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
was very conservative in my
approach and very conscious

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that I was a newcomer
in this sport.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up being the
second fastest American.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I think I was 11th
overall that year,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
far exceeding my expectations
and the expectations

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of everyone else
involved in the event.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what would happen
if I trained a whole year

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.861 align:middle line:84%
and went back to that race fully
prepared with some experience?

00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:90%
So in 2009, that's what I did.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:10%
I was the fastest American that
year and was sixth overall.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Ultraman was really driven
by this question, this quest

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was on, which
was to determine

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
the outer limits
of my capabilities,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What am I truly capable of if
I really put it on the line

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and test myself?

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was a kid, I was
watching sports with my dad

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
on the couch, and we'd see
these all-Americans who were

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
the greatest in the
country, and I said, well,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.922 align:middle line:90%
that's what I want to be.

00:12:31.922 --> 00:12:34.833 align:middle line:84%
I want to be one of the
greatest in the country.

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
That was the dream,
and I actually

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
achieved that dream of being
all-American in two sports.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But then, ultimately, it's to
go get paid to do what you love,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and that was to be a
professional football player.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I did it for a little
bit until I got injured.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I broke my wrist diving into
a wall playing arena football

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:90%
and snapped my wrist.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next
year and a half,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I was on my sister's couch,
six months in a full arm cast.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a college
degree at the time.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really go to
school to learn anything

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.233 align:middle line:90%
except for to play sports.

00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have
any other skills.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
This was in the height of the
economic challenge in the US

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
in 2008, 2009, where people with
degrees weren't getting jobs.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't know
what to do next.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
My whole identity was wrapped
around in being an athlete,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.798 align:middle line:84%
and now I couldn't
do that anymore.

00:13:31.798 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Your friends no longer
want to hang out with you.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.173 align:middle line:90%
You're not getting acknowledged.

00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was extremely
depressing for many months.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
It's really challenging when you
lose your identity, especially

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
as an athlete.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the way
you've been praised.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.315 align:middle line:84%
This is the way you've been
acknowledged your entire life

00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:84%
as being this good or great
athlete, known for this one

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:90%
thing that you can do.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:10%
So when you can no
longer do the one thing

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:10%
that everyone praises you
and acknowledges you for,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:10%
then you don't get
acknowledgment anymore.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just thinking,
well, who am I?

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the challenge is
rediscovering and reinventing

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.275 align:middle line:90%
my purpose once I lost my dream.

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn about just how
to become a better human being

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and not rely on my
athletic abilities.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
In my first half
my life, I really

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
was committed to my dreams in
order to prove people wrong.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a professional
athlete because people

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
said I couldn't do it, because
kids picked on me, because I

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.375 align:middle line:84%
was picked last on
the dodgeball game,

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have
many friends growing up

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
in elementary school.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going
to do this to prove

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:44.355 align:middle line:84%
everyone wrong about me and to
prove to them how good I am.

00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
half of my life,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I was driven by a negative
fuel around this goal,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and that negative
drive was so powerful

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:90%
that it allowed me to--

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:90%
it helped me to achieve my goal.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I was so focused.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I knew exactly what I wanted.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But the energy behind
it was negative.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It was to prove five people
wrong who doubted me.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
achieved my goal, I

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
remember feeling
so empty inside.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, I had the goal.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I had the structure.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I had the game plan, the
daily actions, all the things

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
we talk about, and it happened.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Why am I still not happy?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Why am I unfulfilled?

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Why was I actually angrier after
I achieved it than ever before?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I was so disciplined
for 15 years of my life,

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and now I got exactly what I
wanted, and I wasn't happy.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And I reflected on this and
said, well, maybe my goal

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
is just not big enough.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I need to go after
a bigger goal.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept going after these
unrealistic goals in business

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and life, but it was all
based on this negative fuel

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:90%
of proving people wrong.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So often when someone
sets out to achieve something

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.793 align:middle line:84%
significant that
they've set out--

00:15:47.793 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and even though they have
this inkling in their soul

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that this is not me
anymore, this this

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:90%
is not aligned to who I am--

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:84%
they've set it out as an
intention to the world,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%
so they can't let it go.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So we just stubbornly
move towards the edge

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of the cliff, which represents
an emotional crisis,

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
a breakdown, a slap in the face,
whatever you want to call it.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
The question I always ask is,
who are you seeking validation

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:90%
from?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit
with that question

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and honestly answer that,
truthfully look in the mirror

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and really answer that question
and sit with that question,

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I have never found a human being
that's not seeking validation

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:90%
from somebody else.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And typically, it's
those closest to us.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about
humans, a lot of humans

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
care deeply what
other people think.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You bring that back to your own
home, your family, your mother,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
your father, typically, you
can multiply that by 1,000.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at that and then

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
you basically look at
the goals and dreams

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.837 align:middle line:84%
that you've set for
yourself, what you'll find

00:16:56.837 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is often you're trying
to achieve something

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
because you want to get that
approval, that validation

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
from your dad, from your mother.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I have literally
worked with athletes

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
who have gone to the
pinnacle of their career--

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
they have gone to
the Olympics, they

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
have gone to the
World Cup soccer--

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and their single motivation,
when you get to the core,

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
was they wanted their father,
in most cases-- some cases,

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:90%
their mother--

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
to turn round and say,
I am proud of you.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have spent
10 and 15 and 20

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
years trying to achieve
the pinnacle of this sport

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
for no other reason
than seeking validation

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
from the person that has
been close with them most

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And I realized I was trying
to prove people wrong still,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
shifted to saying,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.485 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try to
prove people wrong anymore,

00:17:46.485 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to lift others
up and prove people right

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and live a life of
service and impact people.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I felt at
peace about my goal setting.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael Beckwith taught
me a model which is really

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called Kensho
versus Satori.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
When you're living life moving
towards a particular purpose,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
there are two very important
things to understand.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Life helps us grow
and correct and evolve

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
true Kensho, which
is growth by pain,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
or Satori, which is
growth by insight.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, you'll
have a Satori moment,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
a sudden awakening, a eureka
moment, an insight that

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:90%
helps you move forward.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But, for most people, that isn't
really going to be as easy.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Most of us grow true Kensho.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Kensho is growth from pain.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You fall sick and
end up hospitalized,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
but you emerge with newfound
respect for your body

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and making new
choices in how you're

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:90%
going to treat your health.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You start a business, and
it fails, and it's painful,

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but that's Kensho
because now you

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
know what not to do
in your next business.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
A relationship dissolves, and
you experience heartbreak.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's Kensho
because now you

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
know the man or woman you
need to evolve to to create

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:90%
even better relationships.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you see life
as Satori moment,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
sudden awakenings, and
Kensho, growth through pain,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
fear dissolves because
you know that even when

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
something bad happens
to you, it's simply

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
a friendly universe giving
you a lesson or fine tuning

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and tweaking your direction
so you can get to your purpose

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:90%
even faster.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:10%
>> When we have difficult times,
that difficulty can either

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:10%
define us, it can diminish
us, or it can develop us.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot about
post-traumatic stress,

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
but we don't hear a lot about
this other area of study

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:90%
called post-traumatic growth.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:10%
This is where you come
through difficulty,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:10%
you come through adversity,
and on the other side,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:10%
you would never wish those
situations for anybody,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:10%
but you also wouldn't
change it for yourself,

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:10%
that because you went through
those challenging times,

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:10%
it changed you, that you
found a deeper meaning.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:90%
You found a new strength.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:90%
You found your mission.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:84%
You found your purpose going
through those difficult times.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a lot
of people in life

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
that have a strength that had
easy lives, really easy lives,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:84%
because through our
struggles, we find sometimes

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:90%
our superpowers.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I had pretty much followed
the prescription for happiness.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I went to graduate school.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:90%
I got a business degree, an MBA.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:10%
I had a cush corporate
job with all the perks.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I had stock options,
company car.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.432 align:middle line:84%
These things are supposed
to bring you happiness,

00:20:38.432 --> 00:20:40.307 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that would
be the case with me,

00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't happy.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.802 align:middle line:84%
I was young, I was successful,
and I was miserable.

00:20:44.802 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like being
a business guy.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't who I was.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I was in a nightclub on my
30th birthday getting drunk

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
with my buddies, and
at 11 o'clock at night,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a midlife crisis,
an epiphany, if you will.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, I don't like

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.208 align:middle line:84%
the course my life
is going down,

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
change it right now.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to become
a runner again.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.595 align:middle line:84%
I used to love to
run when I was a kid,

00:21:07.595 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't run
in over a decade.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw
that I would either

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
pursue a life of kind
of quiet desperation

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
or I would do what I
really wanted to do,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and that was exploration and
run and just see the world.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea I was
going to pay for it all,

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, you know, it
just feels better doing this.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:90%
So I left the night club.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the bar, 11
o'clock at night, and said,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm running 30 miles right now.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Three sheets to the
wind, I just took off,

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.752 align:middle line:84%
started running south
from San Francisco.

00:21:36.752 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I knew if I made it
to a town called Half

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Moon Bay, that
was 30 miles away.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
About 15 miles into
it, I sobered up,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.743 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, what
the hell am I doing?

00:21:45.743 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But it just felt
right, so I kept going.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And that night forever changed
the direction of my life.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm a prolific
runner, and I love

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
running in extreme
conditions as well as

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:90%
running extreme distances.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've run across Death
Valley in the middle of summer

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.167 align:middle line:84%
towards over 130
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:22:08.167 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I've run a marathon
to the South Pole.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.185 align:middle line:84%
I've run across the Gobi,
across the Atacama Desert.

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I ran across the Ancient
Silk Road from Uzbekistan

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.910 align:middle line:84%
through Kyrgyzstan
to Kazakhstan.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I've run on all seven
continents twice now.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to run a marathon
every state of the union,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and my kids only had 50
days off for summer break--

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
so yeah, 50 marathon, 50
states, 50 consecutive days.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Running and physical endurance
is the way I kind of manifest

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.042 align:middle line:84%
that striving to be the best
that I can be, to reach my,

00:23:01.042 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
as the Greeks say,
the [SPEAKING GREEK],,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the perfect alignment of
mind, body, and spirit.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So other people can
achieve their bestness

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
through following
their own passion,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
and running isn't for everyone.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell
people, if it's basket

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:84%
weaving you love, throw
your heart and your passion

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.017 align:middle line:84%
into basket weaving, and
you'll make a go of it.

00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are like,
how am I ever going

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to make a living doing this?

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You'll figure out
a way if you follow

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:90%
what you are truly happy about.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
script your perfect life.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Just take a pen and
a sheet of paper--

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:84%
not a computer-- and just
freeform, just in one paragraph

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
describe what your day
would look like if you

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:90%
were living the perfect life.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Dream.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Make it outrageous.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
kind of a blueprint

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:90%
of where you want to go.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
You really need to
look inward, and that

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
requires quiet
reflection, which is

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:84%
hard to find in our
modern day, right?

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're
constantly bombarded

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:90%
with noise and distractions.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I can tell if somebody
is trapped in conformity

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:10%
by looking at their first
60 minutes this morning.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:10%
That's how I know.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:10%
Are you really living your life?

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's gauge it.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up and you do what
86% of smartphone owners do--

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.955 align:middle line:90%
they grab their phone.

00:24:27.955 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It's right next to the bed.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.705 align:middle line:84%
They grab their phone,
they look at it,

00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and they go into
the social media.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:90%
They go into their email.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They go into their text, their
voice message, their games,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
their day in reaction.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're living a conforming
life, it means you're waking up

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and you are a consumer.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.940 align:middle line:90%
That's how you know .

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:90%
You're waking up.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is not
directing the day.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:90%
You're not planning.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:90%
You're not asking what you want.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
People who wake
up and they check

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:90%
their inbox is a great example.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
The inbox is nothing but a
convenient organizing system

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of other people's agendas.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.052 align:middle line:90%
So you wake up, you check in.

00:25:00.052 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:84%
It's all these people
asking you for something,

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.325 align:middle line:84%
and now it's the world directing
your attention and your day.

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest things we
have to look at is how addicted

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
we are to our screens and how
much that we've given control

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
over to technology, thinking
about how often we're looking

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:90%
at our phones, how many times--

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.288 align:middle line:84%
I think it's up to 150
per day at a minimum

00:25:20.288 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that people are picking up their
phones and checking on them.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And all we're doing
is giving away

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
our time, our power,
and our attention.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection in
there with a real human being.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection
with nature.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.095 align:middle line:84%
We're losing connection with
our own body, our vessel,

00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:84%
all of the wisdom inside
that tells us whether or not

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:84%
we're on track or
we're off track

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:84%
because, again, we're screen
sucking so much of the time.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, apart
from materialism,

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I think so much of the
problem, at least right now

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and it will probably
continue, is

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.862 align:middle line:84%
how much time we're spending
looking at our phones

00:25:52.862 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and looking at screens.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We weren't designed
to live this way.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So many of us live
these sedentary lives.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:84%
We're staring at a screen, what,
eight, nine, 12 hours a day,

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
spending hardly
any time in nature,

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
very little time
with our loved ones.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:10%
Even when we are
having a dinner,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:10%
how many times are kids
either on their iPads

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:10%
or looking at phones?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's checking
texts and Instagram

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and all social media.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
All of that is leaving
us feeling so empty,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing
is reaching for things,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's material things
or food or anything else,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.165 align:middle line:84%
to try and fill up these holes
because we're lacking presence,

00:26:29.165 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're lacking connection,
and we're lacking the sense

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that we actually matter.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we have so much
happening, so much wisdom

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:90%
in these bodies.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
All of our intuition
lives in there.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:84%
All of our creativity
lives in our body.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And if we deaden it because
we're living from the neck up

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:10%
and we're constantly
just in these screens,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:49.210 align:middle line:10%
we're missing out on the joy
and the beauty and the passion

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:10%
and the energy of what
this life is about.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So part of what we need to
do is understand that we're

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:90%
in control, not these phones.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We did this study in High
Performance Academy where we

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
said, you cannot check your
email or any social media

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.240 align:middle line:84%
for the first 60
minutes of your day.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
We increased
productivity in people's

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
self-reported productivity
over the course of seven days

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:90%
by 30%, and it held for 90 days.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you got 30%
more productively each day.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way you do it,
stop conforming to what

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:90%
the world is throwing at you.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't wake up and go
into reaction mode.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and say, what do I
want this day to be about?

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and set some good
intentions for yourself.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Wake up and move your body
to open up some health,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
open up some breath,
open up some endorphins.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Sit down with a piece
of paper and say, OK,

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:90%
what are my main projects today?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Who do I need to reach out
to and ask questions of?

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, first
plan your day.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Ask what you want of it
before you go and say,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:90%
what does everybody else need?

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Our culturescape has
taught us an if-then version

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.400 align:middle line:90%
of happiness.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:84%
If I get this job,
then I will be happy.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
If I get this girl,
then I will be happy.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is
that happiness, you see,

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is not a byproduct
of getting something.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is a state of
being, and happiness is not

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.140 align:middle line:84%
what you get from
achieving your goal.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is rocket
fuel towards your goal.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Happiness moves you
towards your goals.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Happiness increases
your productivity.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Doctors who are
primed to be happy

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
are 19% better at
performing diagnoses.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Salespeople who
are more optimistic

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.675 align:middle line:84%
are 50% better than
pessimistic salespeople.

00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Students do better
in their tests

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:84%
when they are
primed to be happy.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So the trick, the real
trick to success in life

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
is not to not set goals,
it's to have these goals,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.180 align:middle line:84%
but to untangle your
happiness from these goals,

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to be happy before
you attain them,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to use that happiness as
a fuel so that day to day,

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
as you're pursuing these
goals, which can get tricky,

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:84%
which can get challenging,
that happiness

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
is like your ally
that moves you along,

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:84%
that helps dampen the downsides
of occasional obstacles

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:84%
or failure, that
carries you forward,

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that puts you in an
optimistic level of mind

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
so you attract the
right people, you

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.268 align:middle line:84%
can work with the right
people to pursue your goal.

00:29:07.268 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think all of us
get to think about, well,

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
what is the thing that brings us
the most joy, the most passion,

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the most excitement for life,
because that is going to fuel

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:84%
our actions when we go
through adversity, challenges,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
struggles, stress, depression,
because we're all going to face

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.610 align:middle line:90%
challenges.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So what's the fuel
that's going to get us

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:84%
through those
challenges of life?

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
why and our vision

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:90%
support us in having that fuel.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I grew up in a trailer--

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:90%
my mom and dad, four kids.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of canned food,
like hot dogs, smoked sausages.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on powdered milk
and all the processed food.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt, like,
a little bit left out,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different
because we didn't have much.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And the kids would make
fun of me and my clothes

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and being skinny,
and just everything

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
was very much bullied
a lot at a young age.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.977 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't used to
being around people.

00:30:16.977 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was I wanted
to get out of the country.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a
part of the in crowd.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be the country
girl with the Helping Hand

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
clothes and hair was
always messed up.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to do,
so I turned to sports.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I tried to
try out for cheerleading,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:90%
didn't make the team.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.435 align:middle line:90%
I tried out for basketball.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:10%
I was so clumsy.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:10%
I had a growth spurt, didn't
make the basketball team.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So I remember thinking
that, like, what can I do,

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:84%
who do I have to be, because, as
I was, I didn't feel accepted.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel loved.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.452 align:middle line:90%
And so I started to run.

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I know, I
can get on the track team

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.993 align:middle line:84%
because I would run
and catch the bus,

00:30:57.993 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'd always get close
to beating my brothers,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and I was really fast.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.268 align:middle line:84%
So didn't make the
cheerleading team, didn't

00:31:03.268 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:84%
make the basketball, so I
went out for track and field,

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and I made the track
and field team.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:10%
When I started getting
on a track and field team

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:10%
and getting these accolades
and getting faster and faster,

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:10%
I found my sense of purpose.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, I'm important
because I can run fast,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and people are nice
to me, are kind to me.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:90%
My mom and dad cheer for me.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my first
feeling of being accepted.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
When I went through
college my first year,

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:90%
I was training so hard.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't getting enough sleep.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:10%
I graduated with a 3.8,
but all those studies

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:10%
left me not getting
enough sleep,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:10%
not getting enough
recovery time.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to get in the
cold whirlpool, rehab our body,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
go swimming, things
to counterbalance

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
all the things we were
doing on the track,

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and I would skip
those things to study.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually,
my sophomore year,

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I got a stress fracture
in my lower back.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
devastating thing

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that had happened
to me because I

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
was slated to win the
conference the next year,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, my
coach was like, I'm sorry,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
you're out for the season.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just, like--

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:90%
it was just in shock.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe it,
and I got really sad.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I was crying in
classes, and my teachers

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:90%
sent me to the counselor.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And the counselor was
like, you know what,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I think you should try yoga.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
know what yoga was.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I just thought yoga
was Buddha, and it

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
was separate from Christianity,
and I couldn't do it.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.987 align:middle line:84%
But she was like, no,
it's just stretching.

00:32:30.987 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, well,
I don't have a choice.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.903 align:middle line:90%
I got kicked out of class.

00:32:33.903 --> 00:32:36.117 align:middle line:84%
I gotta go do this
yoga stretching thing.

00:32:36.117 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
class, and I remember

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to do a
Headstand, and I felt

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.125 align:middle line:84%
like my brain was going to
ooze out the top of my skull.

00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, I
am not made for this.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.005 align:middle line:84%
This is painful,
and this is not me.

00:32:47.005 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my teacher
seeing me struggle.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:84%
She came up to me,
and she looked at me,

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.085 align:middle line:84%
and she was like, I just
want you to breathe.

00:32:52.085 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I took a big inhale with
her, and we exhaled together,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and for that moment,
I felt spirit.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Then eventually, after a
year of swimming and biking

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and meditation and
yoga, I came back

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to win the conference
meet in college,

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and I led Wichita State to its
first women's championship.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was because of yoga.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I
was like, yay, win.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.622 align:middle line:84%
So I moved to
California to train

00:33:19.622 --> 00:33:22.080 align:middle line:84%
in San Diego, which is close
to the Olympic Training Center

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:90%
because if I'm so close--

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:24.677 align:middle line:90%
I've only had one year.

00:33:24.677 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:84%
If I could do all
of that in one year,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
what can I do if I had a
really great coach and really

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:90%
great training?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.283 align:middle line:90%
And I came out here and I did.

00:33:31.283 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Every time I stepped
on the track,

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.158 align:middle line:84%
I got better and
better and better.

00:33:34.158 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I wasn't
taking care of myself.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I became a personal
trainer at 24 Hour Fitness.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I was working from
5:00 AM to 10:00,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd run track
from 11:00 to about 3:00,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I would go back and
work from 5:00 to 10:00 again.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a full list of clients,
getting great results

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.297 align:middle line:84%
with them, but I was
getting very little

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
sleep and, of course,
very little recovery.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.640 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Injured again-- this time,
I pulled my hamstring.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So here I am, injured again,
and so where do I turn--

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:90%
yoga, meditation.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.035 align:middle line:84%
This time, it healed me
again, and this time, I

00:34:07.035 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
was like, you know what,
there's something to this.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you know what,
I can't let this go again.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.132 align:middle line:84%
I need to commit to
this as a lifestyle

00:34:16.132 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and not just come
in and out of it.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to sign up
for my first yoga teacher

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
training and not just any
yoga teacher training.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I signed up for Ashtanga,
which is the hardest

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:90%
form of yoga you possibly do.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.449 align:middle line:84%
And in that 30 days, I
completely changed my life.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I had visions.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I felt so connected.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I saw my purpose.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I saw me making a difference
in people's lives.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I would be
doing what I'm doing today,

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that I was going to
be doing something great just

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:90%
using my life and my voice.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.335 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I made a
commitment to do yoga daily.

00:34:51.335 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The last time I
checked, which was 2015,

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
there were 1,400 different
studies on the power

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of meditation, everything
from helping reduce the onset

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:84%
of heart disease to helping
improve your skin to improving

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
productivity to improving
compassion and empathy.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is one
of those powerful tools

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that any human being can
bring in their life to improve

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:90%
their functioning in the world.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we don't
know why meditation works.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has yet figured
out the exact reasons

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.275 align:middle line:84%
why meditation causes
all of these feelings.

00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:84%
There are theories, but no
one has really boiled it down.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But just because we
don't know why it works

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean we can't use it.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for the longest
time, human beings

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what the sun was.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures thought it
was a god or a giant fireball,

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:84%
but we could still use
the sun for agriculture,

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
for navigation, for warmth,
for direction, for heat.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, we don't
know why meditation works,

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:84%
but 1,400 studies have now shown
that meditation pretty much

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
enhances so many multiple
dimensions of human living

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that every single
human being should

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:84%
be making this part of
their daily practice.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I know so many people that
meditate from sports stars

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to high performers
on every level,

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has their own
flavor and their own style.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Some people it's a
form of visualization,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and some people it's just
a form of concentration.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone has to find
their own practice.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But what we know,
without any doubt,

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is that all of the science of
both mindfulness and meditation

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is proving over
and over again, we

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
can decrease our stress
by will, by going

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:84%
into a meditative
state we can improve

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.010 align:middle line:84%
our overall health by will by
going into a meditative state.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
We can improve our daily
productivity, our creativity,

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
our resilience,
our relationships.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Every facet of our life we
can improve by meditation,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.078 align:middle line:84%
but meditation
doesn't just happen.

00:37:00.078 --> 00:37:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You have to take the
time and go in that.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.386 align:middle line:90%
Place.

00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:07.075 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's tools out there,
but the first step is to really

00:37:07.075 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:10%
give yourself permission to
slow down and giving yourself

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:10%
permission to do nothing.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.530 align:middle line:10%
And that nothingness can come
on your meditation pillow,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:10%
or that nothingness can come
even if you give yourself

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:10%
five minutes in the morning
to sit with your tea

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:10%
and look out the window with
no device near you at all,

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:10%
with no to-do list in your
mind, but to do nothing.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I do it when
I'm in a taxicab.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of talking with the
cab driver, I'm like, well,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you know what, he's going to
talk to the next five people,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:90%
don't need to talk to me.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Close my eyes.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I also have
transition meditation,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.280 align:middle line:84%
which I think is the most
important thing today

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:84%
because people are trying
to do so many things.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Transition meditation
means, OK, let's say

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I have two big activities--
got to check my inbox,

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and then I have to
create a presentation.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, I don't just do my
email and then jump in

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and start creating that.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead, as soon as I'm done
with the email, I get up,

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll go walk around,
I'll get some water,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.943 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back down,
I'll sit, and I'll just

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:01.730 align:middle line:84%
do a quick two,
three-minute meditation,

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:84%
then I'll start
the presentation.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I tell people, hey,
if you're a dad or you're a mom

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're coming home from
work and your spouse or the kids

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
are in the house, don't take
that long commute where you're

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.095 align:middle line:84%
frustrated and you're giving the
bird to everybody who cuts you

00:38:15.095 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
off and then you go in the house
with that energy of the day.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Pull up to your house, turn the
engine off, close your eyes,

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and let yourself turn
off for a minute.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Take a five, 10, 15-minute
meditation, then get up ,

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:90%
then go into the house.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:10%
That transition from the
commute to going into the house

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:10%
gives you time to reset,
to have some intention,

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:10%
and to go in the house as
a better mom, better dad,

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.860 align:middle line:10%
a better caregiver, a better
lover, because if we just

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:10%
keep going from one thing to
another thing to another thing,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.925 align:middle line:10%
to another thing, another
thing, not only does that

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.280 align:middle line:10%
lead to burnout, it
makes us miss life.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It makes us lack
the ability to bring

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.950 align:middle line:90%
good energy into a moment.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell people, find your
moments in between everything.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.940 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing-- if I
have a full day of calls

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.513 align:middle line:84%
and then I gotta
go meet my wife,

00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to meditate
between those two.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I have to, otherwise
she's going to get Brendan

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.323 align:middle line:90%
who just did the calls guy.

00:39:06.323 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't want her
to have that guy.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I want her to have her husband.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.823 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I
can show up for her

00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:90%
is a transition meditation.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And as a human being
who is very driven,

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
who is very type A, who
works and puts effort

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:84%
into everything, it's a really
wonderful counterbalance.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I also loved that
it's not necessarily

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:84%
attached to any
particular religion

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and that it's really
open for all of us.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:39.015 align:middle line:84%
I found that I can use all of my
type A, driven, get-it-doneness

00:39:39.015 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
in the rest of my life
and have this really

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, simple,
straightforward practice

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to help me dip down into
this infinite intelligence,

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:52.380 align:middle line:84%
this cosmic consciousness
that I think many of us

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.980 align:middle line:84%
have experienced or felt at
different times in our life,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.740 align:middle line:84%
whether we're with a loved
one or we're witnessing

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of a flower or
even in profound sadness when

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
we feel this level of
connection of oneness

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:90%
with everyone and everything.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I come out
of my meditation,

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I find myself feeling a
level of energy and charge

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:84%
that, frankly, I haven't
been able to access

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:20.610 align:middle line:90%
through any other method.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to be an active,
consistent meditator.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is
absolutely crucial.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to gain the
upper hand and the control

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:84%
over that thinking brain
and that idle chatter

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and allows you to
be fully immersed

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in that present moment.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:41.370 align:middle line:90%
And as an athlete, that's key.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't enter that flow
state that you hear about

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:90%
if you're entertaining thought.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to be fully present
in what you're doing.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
are consistently meditating

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.640 align:middle line:90%
is that you develop this acumen.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like push-ups
for the brain.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And you then are the
master of the brain

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.763 align:middle line:90%
rather than being its slave.

00:41:03.763 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> When you meditate, you
go into this brainwave state

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.230 align:middle line:90%
called alpha.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Alpha state is the state
of a relaxed awareness,

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and relaxed awareness is
where you can train yourself,

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
actually, to learn
a language faster,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to be able to learn rapidly
because your conscious mind is

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.410 align:middle line:84%
actually set aside and you
just absorb information faster.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can see the brain
opens in so many new areas when

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.960 align:middle line:84%
we reach that state, meaning
that you tap into different

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.863 align:middle line:84%
things that were not
accessible before.

00:41:42.863 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you then
start to connect

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:84%
those areas and those thoughts
and basically that network

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:84%
of trillions of nerve cells,
you can develop intuition.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition is just
our internal wisdom.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It's this natural knowing
that each of us have

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes we're
never listening to.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the benefits that I
had was my mom trained me ever

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:06.355 align:middle line:84%
since I was little to listen to
the still, small voice inside.

00:42:06.355 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, you will always

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:84%
know the right move to make if
you tap inside and you listen.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:90%
There will always be an answer.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So I heard this message
over and over again.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So whenever in my adult life
I'm wondering which way to go,

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I get quiet and I pay
attention to what's

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.342 align:middle line:90%
happening on the inside.

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition is something that's
been undervalued for many,

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:90%
many years.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I think people are starting to
really appreciate and respect

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.645 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it has
huge value and not

00:42:34.645 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:90%
just in our personal lives.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.060 align:middle line:84%
People think of an
intuition as just,

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.340 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's some fluffy, kind
of personal concept thing,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and it just works
in my personal life.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It's got a massive
application in business.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have
got into relationships

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that we know in our heart and
soul, we know it's not aligned,

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in business or
it's in a personal relationship?

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:84%
We do it anyway,
and it goes south.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.693 align:middle line:90%
We get screwed eventually.

00:42:56.693 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we blame the
person, sometimes we get angry.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.777 align:middle line:84%
But if we looked in
the mirror and said,

00:43:00.777 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, did you really know that
that was in alignment or not,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and often the case
is we absolutely did.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes we're
absorbing so much information

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that we're not giving it
time to go from information

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to knowledge, knowledge
to wisdom, and wisdom

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to awareness because
I'm too busy running

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
to the next book and the
next book and the next book.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm absorbing so
much information,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not allowing it to
translate into awareness

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.428 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:43:27.428 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So to me, intuition is
one of these things that's

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
been suppressed,
it's been blocked,

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and I would encourage
anybody in the world,

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
if they want it, if they want
to get in touch with more

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.690 align:middle line:84%
intuition, if they want to
increase their intuition,

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.812 align:middle line:84%
if they want to
uncover more of it,

00:43:44.812 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
don't go looking
for it externally.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself, why isn't it?

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not in touch with it?

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.267 align:middle line:90%
What's blocking it?

00:43:51.267 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Intuition has just been blocked.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.340 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that there is a
tremendous amount of guidance

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
that I don't see
with my physical eye.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
my primary job

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.840 align:middle line:84%
is to just be in alignment
with that source.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I align, I can
hear that guidance.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I can allow that guidance
to show up in my life,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.650 align:middle line:84%
open invisible doors, write
through me, speak through me,

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
just move through me
in magnificent ways.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, there's
plenty of things

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I get hung up about, things
that are out of my control,

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
but I continue to come back
to that space of surrender

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:34.740 align:middle line:84%
because, as a human, I'm having
a human experience of wanting

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and trying to control timing of
things that are completely out

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.050 align:middle line:90%
of my hands.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But those are momentary lapses,
and I've transformed that fear

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:84%
into faith, and I've
chosen to allow that faith

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.890 align:middle line:90%
muscle to be stronger.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that I measure
my spiritual success based

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.323 align:middle line:90%
on how perfectly aligned I am.

00:44:57.323 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I really measure it based
on how quickly I come back

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.581 align:middle line:90%
to alignment.

00:45:00.581 --> 00:45:04.730 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Take care of yourself.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:10.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people go hard at their
career, go hard at parenting,

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and without taking
care of yourself,

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.080 align:middle line:84%
you really can't
take care of others.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The more you take
care of yourself,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
the more energy you're going
to have to pour into others.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Fill your cup and then serve
others from the overflow.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That's something one of my
favorite speakers always says.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It's Lisa Nichols.

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:84%
She's just like, you're supposed
to serve from your saucer.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Meditation and yoga,
all that together was

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.450 align:middle line:90%
making me a stronger person.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I felt
stronger and stronger.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that I
experienced when I was younger,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I started to release and
let go through practicing

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:90%
more and more yoga.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, the more
yoga that I practiced,

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the more I was able
to release the past

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and step into my strength
as a person, as a teacher,

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and as a leader.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Pay attention to that
little voice there and bring

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.700 align:middle line:84%
expression to that in your
own life and, in so doing,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps connect with yourself
more deeply and ultimately

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.790 align:middle line:84%
express a more authentic
version of who you are.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:17.650 align:middle line:90%

>> We're all interconnected,
and to contribute your utmost

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to society, to humanity, I think
you need to pursue what it is

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:90%
that's uniquely within you.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.135 align:middle line:84%
And I just think that that is
the best course for humanity.

00:46:31.135 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:84%
If everyone was to do
that, I think the world

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:34.052 align:middle line:90%
would be a happier place.

00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we are all,
all of us without exception,

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.480 align:middle line:84%
sitting on top of mountains of
untapped human potential just

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:84%
waiting to be unlocked
and unleashed.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky enough
to wake up at 40

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:02.320 align:middle line:90%
and embark upon this journey.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And my responsibility
with what I've experienced

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:84%
is to share with
others in hopes that I

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.680 align:middle line:84%
can help to activate and
catalyze their version of what

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.550 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Of course, not everyone wants to
be an ultra endurance athlete.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:20.620 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that people can
look at those experiences

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and my story and
draw inspiration

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:84%
from that to then examine their
own lives under a microscope

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to better identify what
it is within them that has

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.970 align:middle line:90%
gone unaddressed for too long.

So follow your
dreams because that's

00:47:42.918 --> 00:47:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the thing that brings
us the most joy, when

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.100 align:middle line:84%
we have something
to look forward to,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:84%
when we have something
we want to chase.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a purpose,
a reason, and a meaning

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:58.410 align:middle line:84%
to get up every single
day and make a difference.

What gets you out of
bed in the morning

00:48:03.765 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:90%
and excited about your life?

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not suspecting
that everybody's

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.340 align:middle line:84%
going to have an answer
to that immediately,

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.760 align:middle line:84%
but I think exploration
of that inquiry

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.820 align:middle line:84%
is the path forward
to ultimately living

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.590 align:middle line:84%
a more purposeful,
meaningful life,

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because if you can
identify that thing--

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and it can be as silly as I
like making paper-mache birds,

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
or I want to tell
jokes on stage,

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.400 align:middle line:84%
or I want to learn how
to play the guitar.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
that thing of like, well,

I'm just going to
quit my job overnight.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think the more
you can invest yourself

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:84%
in that journey of
trying to identify

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:48.590 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you are here to
do, that is the path forward.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you commit
yourself fully to that,

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you will be amazed at
what transpires over time.
