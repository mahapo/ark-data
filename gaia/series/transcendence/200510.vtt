00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Say you're walking
through the park one day.

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful summer's day.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.760 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling wonderful.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Then a Pit Bull breaks
loose from its owner.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Rushes over to you
with mouth open,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
fangs dripping with
saliva, just barking.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, your whole day shifts.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.093 align:middle line:90%
You move into fight or flight.

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to react to
this threat from the outside.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So your body is translating
this external stimulus

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Pit Bull into internal
biochemical molecular

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:90%
messengers.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.198 align:middle line:84%
And those are going
throughout your whole body.

00:00:52.198 --> 00:00:54.905 align:middle line:84%
And they're pushing you into
stress, not in 20 seconds.

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Those genes wreak
peak expression

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.067 align:middle line:90%
in under three seconds.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, your body's
flooded with adrenaline,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
flooded with cortisol
very, very quickly.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're then
responding to that threat.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the stress
response is meant to work.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.283 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors survived
because they had a hair

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:90%
trigger stress response.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And in any ancient
tribe 500,000 years ago,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
those people with the
best stress response,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:84%
with the best ability to
make lots of adrenaline,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
those people lived,
which was perfect

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
when there were tigers and
mastodons and all kinds

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
of predators around us.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.265 align:middle line:84%
Now, the worst predator we
have is our own thoughts.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, I go back home.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The Pit Bull event
is five hours old.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get injured.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Nothing bad happened.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm telling
the story to my child.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting upset.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I can feel my
heart racing faster

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:90%
as I think about the Pit Bull.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:90%
My face is flushing.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm having the same
stress response

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.288 align:middle line:84%
in response to my own
thinking and emotion

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:90%
as I had to the Pit Bull.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
If we do that over and over
and over again, if we retell

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
the sad tragic
story of our past,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
if we stay stuck
in our childhood

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
traumas and the unresolved
issues of our past,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
if we remain there over
and over and over again,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it has a terrible
effect on our bodies.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.112 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
When we say thought
or emotion, we

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:84%
think of something
insubstantial, intangible.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our
thoughts and emotions

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
are driving changes
in our bodies,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
changes in the world around
us every single moment,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
every single thought.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The way I would conceptualize it
is that thoughts are transient,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:90%
but beliefs are long-term.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And a belief is a
pattern of thought.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
a fleeting thought.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you think that thought
over and over and over again,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
just say, for example, a thought
of self-criticism, or something

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
you don't like about
the world, or blame

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
you had with somebody
else or a big system,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:84%
like a government
or a corporation.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
All of those thoughts, if
you hold them consistently,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
can solidify into fixed
beliefs and a worldview.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example,
you might initially

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of things not
being good in your life.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.125 align:middle line:84%
May have had
adverse experiences.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that may
develop into a belief

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
an unsafe place.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're driving high
cortisol, high adrenaline.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You're triggering
gene expression

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and a whole cascade
of biological events

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:90%
with that belief.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
If you then add emotion
and believe that strongly,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
where you're passionate
about your belief,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
now you're adding
fuel to the fire.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you'll
see a big increase

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
in gene expression, big
increase in those stress

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
hormones like
adrenaline and cortisol,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and emotion is adding
fuel to that process.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
If you think that thought
persistently day after day

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
after day, if it's a belief,
becomes a world view,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have
emotion with it, now

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
you're raising
your cortisol level

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So high cortisol over time leads
to reduced muscle mass, reduced

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
bone density, increased
skin wrinkling,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:90%
degradation of digestion.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
All of these things start
to be affected negatively

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
by those thoughts
held for a long time.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
People under high stress
have high cortisol.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Eventually cortisol
literally begins

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to calcify the memory and
learning centers in your brain.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Your hippocampus can get
calcium deposits on it

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
if you have high
cortisol over time.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you want calcium
in your bones and teeth

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and places like that.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.393 align:middle line:84%
You do not want calcium
forming in your hippocampus,

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:90%
your memory learning center.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly what happens
in stressed people over time.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, your mind, your
consciousness fueled by emotion

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is producing substantial
changes in your brain.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.653 align:middle line:84%
The software of mind is turning
into the hardware of brain.

00:05:27.653 --> 00:05:29.945 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have a different
brain affected by stress.

00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The body itself is energy.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if you magnify your
hand a million times or more,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
eventually you're face
to face with an atom.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And you realize if you look
in the atom there's really

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
nothing in there, just
empty space, right?

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And some infinitesimally
tiny energies

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that are zipping around
at the speed of light.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we are.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're
experiencing emotions,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
you see, what we believe
is that every emotion has

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
its own specific frequency.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.022 align:middle line:84%
And if you're feeling an
emotion of anger, for example,

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that's a different frequency
or a different vibration

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.427 align:middle line:90%
than an emotion of sadness.

00:06:02.427 --> 00:06:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's different
from frustration.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
They're all different.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you're feeling an
emotion that's powerful enough,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
your whole being can
take on this vibration.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And in those circumstances,
what can happen

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of that emotion
can become just too much

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:90%
for the body to take.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so some of that
energy remains behind.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a process that
we go through when

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:90%
we experience emotions.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
The emotion is generated by the
organs and some of the glands.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so in other words,
what's generated

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is the emotional frequency that
we perceive as the emotion.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
The emotion is generated.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
We feel the emotion.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:90%
We acknowledge it.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we allow it to
dissipate and move on.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the process that
we are supposed to go through.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:84%
If that process is
interrupted somewhere,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
if we either bury that
emotion and we don't allow

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
it to surface, or if that
emotion is just so big that we

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
can't really deal with it,
then the energy of that emotion

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:90%
remains in the body.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then what happens is it
may manifest many, many years

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
down the road as all kinds
of different problems.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The operative word that
we use is discomfort.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
If you have some
kind of discomfort,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
emotionally based.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, discomfort can be physical
or mental or emotional.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you meditate,
if you do EFT tapping,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.523 align:middle line:84%
if you spend time in nature,
if you're in your heart,

00:07:24.523 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
if you spend time
with loved ones,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you have rich social networks,
all of these things go

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
into reverse.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not making
lots of cortisol.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
You're making lots of DHEA
and other positive hormones.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And DHEA is also called
the youthing hormone.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, with high levels of
DHEA, all those aging signs,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
all those physical
things go into reverse.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
A happy person has high
DHEA, high oxytocin.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin then sparks the
production of neurochemicals,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
like anandamide, the bliss
molecule, in your brain.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Like nitric oxide, which
makes you alert in your life.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
All these positive
things happen when

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
you are a positive thinker,
when you meditate, when you tap.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
When you do all these practices
that center you and give you

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:90%
a positive affect mood outlook.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, thought, consciousness
fueled by positive emotion

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.935 align:middle line:90%
is becoming vibrant health.

00:08:14.935 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the direction
you want to nudge yourself

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
in with every thought.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.515 align:middle line:84%
People think their
thoughts are innocuous.

00:08:20.515 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
insubstantial.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're affecting your
body every single moment.

If you knew the harm
it did to your body,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
you would do your utmost to
quit that negative thinking

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%

And like everybody,
we were kids,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and we were just out
having a couple beers.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I remember walking to the car.

we fought to ride shotgun.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.208 align:middle line:90%
I was riding shotgun.

00:09:21.208 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I was a bad-ass, so I
didn't put my seat belt on.

There was an
interaction between Mike

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
in the back seat and the driver.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And something happened where the
driver lost control of the car.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
The driver hit the
brakes, went into a skid,

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:90%
and then hit a guardrail.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It blew the engine
through my seat

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and out the back of the car.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:84%
My face was blown off
my head, and my femur

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:90%
was shattered into 200 pieces.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:90%

he was speaking
about these topics.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So one night, I wrote a letter
to the driver of the car.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And I just put it away.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to
send it or anything.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up the next
morning, and I read it.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like let me check
out what's on the internet.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So I googled him and
found them on Facebook.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And I set up a second
Ira Israel account

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
so he would see
it's me, but I just

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
didn't want him to see my
whole life or anything.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And I sent the letter.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just told them what
I'd done for those 25 years.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, things I
was feeling and whatnot.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:90%
And I went to work.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And I came home.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
like 6:00 at night.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, let me check
this other Facebook account.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I received
an equally long letter.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And I started to read it.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was really heartfelt.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising
to everybody when

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
you show up in a certain
way, like I can't

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:90%
tell you be vulnerable, right?

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But if I show up
in a certain way,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I can inspire you or enroll you.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how much
personal work this person

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
had done over the past
25 years or something.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But he showed up
like a gentleman.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And we went back and forth for
a week, talking about our lives.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the week, he
had told me how sorry he was.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
I just felt compelled.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just wrote
in all capitals,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
if it helps you in any
way, I forgive you.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:90%
And I deleted the account.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I never had any of those
machinations or anything,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:84%
like, all the
negativity, you know?

irony cause your mind was built

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to create resentments-- woulda,
coulda, shoulda, didn't.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things that show up

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
as the causes of suffering
because, you know,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to change
the unchangeable.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:90%
I can't go back to 1985.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And if I did, something worse
might have happened, right?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But your mind is this incredible
machine that looks at the past

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and says, wow, that
was really traumatic.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
let that happen again.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lift weights,
or I'm going to get rich.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Or I'll show them.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.837 align:middle line:84%
And you do this
whole crazy thing.

00:14:15.837 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You're only causing
your own suffering

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
because it's like trying to jam
a square peg into round hole.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:90%
You can't change the past.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you're out
there, and you're like, well,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll show them that they
shouldn't have mistreated me

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:90%
because I'll be famous.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be rich.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:90%

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:90%
You'll get there.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll realize
that those people--

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.592 align:middle line:90%
you don't exist to them.

We're taught that emotions
and showing emotion

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:90%
is a sign of weakness.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we tend to
suppress those emotions.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%

women are much more

while men are much less likely.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%

and so on in certain categories.

is that they seem to be the
biggest single underlying cause

of depression and anxiety
and phobias and panic attacks

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:84%
and PTSD and eating disorders
and self-sabotage of all kinds.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And they also are the
biggest underlying cause

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of the physical pain
that people experience--

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
neck pain, migraine headaches,
low back pain, knee pain.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%
But other problems too.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
People seek medical help for
many other kinds of conditions.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience
over the last 30 years,

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
those conditions,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
things like infertility and
asthma and digestive disorders,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and even cancer, all of those
diseases, in my experience,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
always have an underlying
emotional component.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.027 align:middle line:84%
>> I always would
say, kind of proudly,

00:16:16.027 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I was almost killed
in a car accident.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So for about 25
years, until I started

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
getting more and more into
compassion and Buddhism

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.058 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I took
a course, and you had

00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:90%
to tell the story of your life.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And someone said, you know,
OK, what happened here?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
gentleman who was tasked

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:90%
with deconstructing the story.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I say I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, you weren't.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, actually,
my femur were shattered.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:90%
My face is blown off my head.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't notify my
parents because they didn't

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
think I was going to live.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, you weren't.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
We went back and forth.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, he says
there was a car accident.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything else you added.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:90%
You can't be almost pregnant.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't be almost dead.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:90%
You're either alive or dead.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:90%
There was a car accident.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:90%
So language creates reality.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The way you choose
to frame your life,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're either the
hero of your story,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
or you're the victim.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And for those first 25 years,
I realized in that instant

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
that I was sucking
people into my drama.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
Trying to get them
to be empathetic.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.955 align:middle line:84%
And I just made a
conscious choice, like, no.

00:17:30.955 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask me now, it's
like, there was a car accident.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:42.947 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.947 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:90%
[SIRENS]

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when we look at
trauma and different traumatic

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
experiences, I like to
think of it as an empty cup.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:90%
So you've got a water glass.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And something happens to you
when you're two years old.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.423 align:middle line:84%
And you pour a little
bit of water in.

00:17:57.423 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
bit of trauma.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And then five years and
10 years, then a horrible

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, the cup overflows.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It's too much for
the body to handle.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why some people can
have one traumatic experience.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And they can change from it.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:90%
They can grow from it.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.037 align:middle line:84%
There's post-traumatic
growth as a thing.

00:18:19.037 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And other people, a
soldier comes back

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
from war dealing with PTSD,
his nervous system, his body,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.505 align:middle line:84%
his brain, his spirit is
just completely overwhelmed.

00:18:28.505 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two
kinds of trauma.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
There is simple trauma.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And there's complex trauma.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And complex trauma is
usually developmental trauma.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So an example of simple trauma
is somebody is 25 years old.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:90%
They have a terrible car crash.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're in hospital
for a long time.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It takes them a
great many months

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to regain physical function.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And this shatters their lives
in some fundamental way.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a simple trauma.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
A complex trauma is one
where there was abuse,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
often as a child.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
developed mental trauma

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
where you were beaten over and
over and over again, or where

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
you were being
neglected, whether you

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.738 align:middle line:84%
were being physically
assaulted, and it was repeated.

00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
kind of trauma

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is growing
while that trauma is happening.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And that information is
being installed at the level

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:90%
of circuits in your brain.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a thought
or a belief or one event.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:90%
It is crucial.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:84%
It is fundamental to the actual
way your brain wired together.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
For the first two years of
life, the fastest growing brain

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
region is the limbic system.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So the limbic system,
the emotional midbrain,

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest
growing brain region.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not a part of the
brain that has language,

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:90%
but it feels.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:90%
It feels deeply.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
being traumatized

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:84%
while that part of
your brain is growing,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
then trauma is woven into
the neural fabric of the way

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
your brain structure is.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
trauma is hard to treat.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
We find in trauma
treatment manuals

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and approaches that simple
trauma is relatively easy,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
but developmental
trauma, complex trauma

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:90%
is hard to treat.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
person get through it?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can't easily get through
it using cognitive techniques,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
using thought or
language-based therapies.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit you
in a chair and say

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't feel
that way because it's

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.737 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to the way
your brain functions.

00:20:20.737 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up in a
really beautiful family.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
My parents would hang out
with this other couple.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And this man, I was
told to call uncle.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:90%
We would go to my uncle's house.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
They would all have
some type of party,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:90%
like drink a lot of beer.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.405 align:middle line:84%
And there were
like rowdy nights.

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
And I would in the back bed.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:90%
And he would come in.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It had happened so
many times, and then I

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:90%
would fall back asleep.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.365 align:middle line:84%
I believe that it was happening
before I could even talk.

00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
There was a level of
unawareness from my parents

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that it was happening.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
The very first memory that
actually came up for me

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the bookend
of when it stopped.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
I must have been five years old.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember standing
off and being like,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
you're not coming in anymore.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like
wanting to stop it.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.335 align:middle line:84%
And really feeling like I've
got to stand up for myself.

00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were times
when I even tried

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:90%
to tell my auntie about it.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And they shut me down.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I never spoke to
anyone about it.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just got really
bottled down more and more.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's
overwhelming for a child,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
so you block it out
and you numb it.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And you forget about it.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
15 years passed, and when I
hit my late teens, early 20s,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.842 align:middle line:84%
I went into drugs,
a lot of escapism.

00:22:13.842 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Didn't want to be
with my thoughts.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Didn't want to be
with my emotions.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:90%
And really run my body down.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I was having anxiety attacks.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I was really overwhelmed.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a peak time where
I started actually smashing

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:84%
the window above my
bed to try to escape

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the night thinking

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
intruder coming in.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what is going
on in my subconscious?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't start
uncovering my trauma

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
until I was probably
19 years old

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
after being on a massive
level of escapism on drugs.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, not only did
I have to clear the trauma,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
but I had to clear
all of the drug abuse

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:90%
that was on top of the trauma.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So I went into so
many modalities

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
my physical body,

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.098 align:middle line:90%
such as juicing and cleansing.

00:23:10.098 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, when you
do that, more emotions come up.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered
meditation, yoga.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I became a Reiki practitioner.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I studied energy healing.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much read every
book that I could find.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
All of these methods allowed
me to drop in and recognize

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
who I was and to let go of the
story that was controlling me.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
lot of health issues

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that are caused by
drugs, that's affecting

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
your psychology, that's
making you feel sick,

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:90%
there's like detox going on.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy for the
mind to identify with that

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, that's who I am.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that
earlier time in my life,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
yes, any escapism is
seeking to find love.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It's seeking to have
that connection.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It's seeking to feel
held and embraced.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And so it does give you that.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
beautiful part about it.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But in that time in my life,
I was getting those feelings,

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
but I also wasn't doing
the inner work with them.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I was combining it with
alcohol and smoking.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mind set wasn't
about looking within.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It was about partying and
not thinking about it.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was a hard
process to go through

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
to even recognize, like,
oh, did this really happen?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, I haven't remembered this.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, but I could feel

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:90%
it being released in my body.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And the intense emotion
that was coming out

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.017 align:middle line:84%
of me when I was healing, I was
like, you can't make this up.

00:24:51.017 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
happens to a lot of people

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
who have blocked out trauma,
especially sexual abuse

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
because I work with
a lot of women,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
even men who have had
sexual abuse earlier on.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And they've numbed it out.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they think
they're making it up,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:90%
or how could this be true.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.358 align:middle line:84%
But if there's emotion
running through your system

00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
while you're processing it, you
know there's something there.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.275 align:middle line:84%
>> When something
happens to you,

00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and you feel an
emotion coming up,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that's really a message
from your deep subconscious.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, that message
that's coming up

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
is happening not only because of
what's going on in the moment,

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's also coming up
because of past experience.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon of trapped
emotions is really universal.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're having any
kind of discomfort,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.078 align:middle line:84%
that's a sign of
emotional baggage.

00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:84%
If you're having physical
discomfort in some way,

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.828 align:middle line:84%
there's something that
doesn't feel right

00:25:43.828 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
in your body, 99 times
out of 100 there will be

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:90%
some emotional baggage there.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling some kind of
emotional or mental discomfort

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
in some way, if your life
isn't working like it should.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
If you keep picking the wrong
kind of person as a mate

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
over and over, and you
can't figure out why.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
If you tend to feel certain
emotions that you don't really

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
understand, you're
not sure where

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:84%
they're coming from, if some
things easily trigger you.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can become upset
at the drop of a hat,

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
or you find yourself
crying for no reason.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if you are not able to
keep enough money in your bank

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:90%
account.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Or if you just can't seem to
find love, and you're alone.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Those are all signs
of emotional baggage.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I started working
on the core piece,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.272 align:middle line:84%
which was like why am I getting
up in the middle of the night

00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and smashing a window, and
all the trauma and fear

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that's running through my
body when that's taking place.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
use tapping on it,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:90%
the memory started to come.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was the very first
time I actually got my memory

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:90%
back around what happened.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And probably for
about six months

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I did continual work on that
and pulled out so many layers.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
memories kept unfolding.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And more and more love was
brought to those memories.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of the fear that
was trapped in my system

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:90%
started to dissolve.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And those reactions that I would
have in the middle of the night

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
stopped.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.515 align:middle line:84%
And I became more
peaceful inside.

00:27:13.515 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so much anger
and judgment present when

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
the trauma has not
been addressed.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're not ready
to even entertain

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
the idea of why their father did
what they did, or their mother

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:90%
did what they did.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But when they can start to heal
the trauma within themselves

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
separated from the
individual, and they

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
can start moving through
some of the stories,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
they can start integrating the
rest of us and living with it.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And seeing that
there is an upside.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a very, very,
very, very sensitive subject

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:84%
when you present the idea that
perhaps some goodness came

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
from the trauma that
you've experienced.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And people have to
be ready to hear that

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and ready to receive that.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:90%
And then they're open.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.185 align:middle line:84%
When they start to see there's
something good in this,

00:27:59.185 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:90%
there's a learning in this.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:90%
There's an awareness in this.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Then they're ready to go back to
the father they haven't spoken

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in 10 years, the mother
they have ostracized out

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
of their life, and even the
ones that have passed away

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and to create healing there.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When you take that power
back, and when you say,

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I can let go of that thing
that happened 10 years ago.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's crazy
about limiting beliefs,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
our lives, our body, trauma.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not walking around with
what happened this morning

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.782 align:middle line:84%
We're walking around with what
happened yesterday and the day

00:28:30.782 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:84%
before and really, in the
decades since that have

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:90%
made us the people who we are.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:84%
This whole mind-body
concept, right?

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.147 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whoa,
mind-body, it's so new.

00:28:40.147 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty ridiculous
if you think about it, right?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.272 align:middle line:84%
That we have cut off
ourselves at the head,

00:28:44.272 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and we're like, OK,
there's the head,

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.080 align:middle line:90%
the things that we think about.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the body.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you think about it,
we have this conscious mind,

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:84%
which is where we spend
all of our waking hours.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind
is the other part of us,

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
this vastly
intelligent part of us,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that is so smart that it
can take the sandwich you

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
had for lunch and can
convert some of that

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
over into new cardiac muscle
tissue or new nerve cells.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a level of
intelligence beyond our ability

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to really comprehend at
this point where we are.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So the conscious mind
is a tiny, tiny part

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of your total intelligence.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, they say that a
single cell in the body

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent in complexity to
a full size aircraft carrier

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of people working
onboard at their different jobs

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.212 align:middle line:84%
with jets on the ramp
with their engines

00:29:30.212 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:90%
pulled up, ready to take off.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a single cell.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And the last estimate was
that the average adult has

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.982 align:middle line:90%
about 137 trillion of those.

00:29:36.982 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you something--
your subconscious mind is

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
aware of every single one of
those, down to the DNA level,

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:90%
down to the quantum level.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And so every face you've ever
seen in the crowd, everything

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you've ever eaten or tasted
or touched or smelled,

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the whole history of
your health or disease

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
it's all in there in
that subconscious mind.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So consciously, we are
barely functional, I think.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:84%
We like to think of
ourselves as really smart,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
but the subconscious
mind puts us all

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
to shame because it
is so intelligent.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem is, you
see, the conscious mind

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious mind need
to agree on certain things.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say
that you would like

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:90%
to become wealthy, all right?

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's fine.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Consciously you want
to become wealthy.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to
move in that direction.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
But if your
subconscious mind has

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:84%
learned from the things
that have come in

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as inputs that it's not
OK for you to be wealthy,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.750 align:middle line:84%
what will happen is
the subconscious mind

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:90%
will prevent that.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Or you may become wealthy,
and then lose that wealth

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.768 align:middle line:84%
and have to regain
it over and over.

00:30:44.768 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And this applies to everything.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:84%
We actually had
this case once where

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
there was a woman who was
trying to lose weight.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:90%
She was very overweight.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was we finally

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:84%
were able to understand
was that she had seen

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:90%
what happened with her mother.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Her mother, when she was
a child, was overweight.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Went on a diet, lost the
weight, promptly had an affair,

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed the family,
ended up in divorce.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Terribly painful.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So here's this child now,
who's in her 40s and 50s,

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:84%
trying to lose weight and
can't because the subconscious

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
mind has this idea
that if we lose weight,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:90%
we'll have an affair.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And our marriage will end.

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.378 align:middle line:90%
And that'll be the end of it.

00:31:24.378 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And so she was never able to
get to that point, you see?

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that emotional
baggage will run us.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a very famous
study called the ACE Study,

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Adverse Childhood Experiences.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Massive number of people looking
at what happened in childhood.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's an ACE
score, so you can

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.227 align:middle line:84%
go through different
traumatic experiences.

00:31:45.227 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And you add them up.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And for the people who have the
highest traumatic experiences

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.820 align:middle line:90%
score, they get one score.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.903 align:middle line:84%
And if not many things
happen to you in childhood,

00:31:51.903 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:90%
you get another score.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what's crazy about
these this study in particular,

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's been repeated
since then, smoking, cancer,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:84%
addiction, directly correlated
with adverse childhood

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.575 align:middle line:84%
So you think to yourself,
what does cancer--

00:32:09.575 --> 00:32:11.200 align:middle line:84%
something happened
to you in childhood,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and now you're more likely, it's
not like the only determinant,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:84%
but you're more likely to get
cancer statistically because

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:90%
of these experiences.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's happening
in the body, when we think

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
about especially those
tough experiences,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:90%
the environment is unsafe.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I think about the word safety.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I use it a lot in tapping.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Even though I don't feel safe.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.315 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
think about that.

00:32:36.315 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't walk around
going do I feel safe or not.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I ask people,
especially who

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
have been traumatized
in deep ways,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.380 align:middle line:90%
do you feel safe in your body?

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
They answer, no.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
When they tune in, they go,
and you can do it at home

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
right now, you can
close your eyes and go,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:90%
do I feel safe in my body?

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And what that's going to
open you up to is what

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.830 align:middle line:84%
are the parts of you
that have been running

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
with that traumatic event,
that have felt anxious,

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:90%
that have gripped tight.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what happens
when trauma is created,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:90%
the body goes, uh.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And all too often,
it doesn't let go.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, if we think
about that holding on tight,

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
if I close my fist
right now, and I

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, I'm going to
squeeze it for five minutes.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.035 align:middle line:84%
Five minutes later, this
is going to start to hurt.

00:33:25.035 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And if I go, well,
you know what,

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:27.993 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to squeeze
it for two hours.

00:33:27.993 --> 00:33:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is getting
uncomfortable.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be really
uncomfortable when I open it.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine squeezing
like this for a decade.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.223 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't be able
to open my hand, right?

00:33:39.223 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:84%
It would probably
get all crippled.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Blood flow would be affected.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:90%
The growth would be affected.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
If this happened
when I was young,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
who knows how the
fingers actually grow?

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.223 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they stop growing because
they're stuck in this place.

00:33:52.223 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what happens
to us emotionally when we have

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.807 align:middle line:90%
these traumatic experiences.

00:33:55.807 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We're holding on so tight,
and we're walking around

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:84%
with this belief about the world
that we got to keep gripping.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:90%
You got to stay safe.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.215 align:middle line:84%
You can't be open
and vulnerable.

00:34:05.215 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And that affects the
rest of our lives.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So then when we-- you talked
about finding in our 20s, 30s,

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:84%
40s, whenever it is,
finding that we've

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
been gripping like this,
it's a little uncomfortable

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to begin to open that up.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:90%
It can feel unsafe.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It can be painful.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, I don't
want to look there,

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
which is why it's great to have
every tool at your disposal--

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:84%
tapping, the right practitioner,
or the right therapist,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.563 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's that
deep traumatic stuff.

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
All these new tools
and techniques

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:90%
to begin to unfold that.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
To begin to open up that
hand to allow the body

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.733 align:middle line:90%
to feel that it's safe.

00:34:39.733 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you're
trapped in negative belief

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to build
positive neural capacity

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:84%
and new beliefs, it's hard
because your brain is used

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:90%
to functioning in those ways.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We know from the work of Nobel
Prize winning Professor Eric

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Kandel that if you pass a
signal through a neural bundle

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.050 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly for an hour,
the number of synapses

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.533 align:middle line:90%
can double in an hour.

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what if
you've been passing

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
angry thoughts and
resentful thoughts

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
or guilty thoughts
or shameful thoughts

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.680 align:middle line:84%
through those circuits for
years and years and years?

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You now have massive
neural bundles dedicated

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to sending those signals.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, you think, gee, you
know, I'm a miserable person.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm horrible to my kids.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm miserable in my job.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I keep on having
financial disasters.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll go take a weekend
workshop at the Dawson Church,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.595 align:middle line:84%
you know, Deepak Chopra
or someone like that.

00:35:29.595 --> 00:35:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And so they go to a Tony
Robbins workshop or Joe Dispenza

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.100 align:middle line:84%
workshop or Marianne
Williamson workshop.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And now, you feel great
after the workshop.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You're in this temporary
state of euphoria.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:90%
You feel so good.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But then Monday morning, you're
back in your regular life

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:84%
with all the
stimuli that trigger

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:84%
the firing of those neural
bundles, which have been

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:90%
building for the last 30 years.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.268 align:middle line:84%
And you revert right
back to the way you are.

00:35:51.268 --> 00:35:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's the challenge
of personal growth.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to build that
signaling capacity.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:90%
We have to build that belief.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to build those
positive circuits,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
even before we have
the experience of them.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> People only know
what they know.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you're born into a
family that doesn't love,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:84%
then that's what
you think love is.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And so you look for that
because it's comfortable,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and it's what you know.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know that
a whole new level of love

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.200 align:middle line:90%
is available out there.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you attract people
based on what you expect

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and what you grew up
with a lot of the time.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's often very hard
for someone that

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.470 align:middle line:84%
grew up with punishment or abuse
to even recognize that there's

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:90%
something better out there.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:84%
They may, like, on
the surface know,

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but on a subconscious
level, as a child,

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
especially between the
ages of zero and seven,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at your reality.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at your
parents, the people that

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:90%
taught you as like gospel.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And that sets up the pathways
to this is what reality is.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you should expect.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:90%
And this is normal.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And later on, you still
have those patterns,

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.810 align:middle line:90%
so you're looking for that.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.370 align:middle line:90%
You attract that.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And then things
get really hectic.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, wow, this
isn't really helping me,

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.860 align:middle line:84%
but I keep attracting these
types of people into my life.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, hopefully, you have
some type of support around you

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that can help guide you to
understand that there's so much

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:84%
more out there, so much
more available, so much more

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
love and caringness that
can come into your life,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.170 align:middle line:84%
even though you've
never experienced it.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Some people love yoga.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Some people prefer
Qigong or Tai Chi.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Some might prefer
martial arts or dance.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:90%
So same thing with therapy.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people respond really well
to cognitive therapies, others

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:84%
energy therapies,
others hypnotherapy.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So you want to play around with
this whole beautiful bundle

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And then find the one
that works for you.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Like someone said to
me once, Tommy Dawson,

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:90%
you've done all this research.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
You've looked all these
different therapies.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Which is the best therapy?

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'll tell
you the best therapy.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.865 align:middle line:84%
The best therapy is the
one that works for you.

00:38:03.865 --> 00:38:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Another time someone
said to me, what's

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:84%
the very best form
of meditation?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, the best
form of meditation

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:90%
is the one you'll do every day.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.922 align:middle line:84%
So play around in all
these different techniques.

00:38:14.922 --> 00:38:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And then pick the one that
resonates with your energy

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.130 align:middle line:84%
system, with your psyche, with
your history, with your body.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> My beautiful 90-year-old
psychologist and the best

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.580 align:middle line:84%
teacher I've ever had when I've
been going for the toughest

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.810 align:middle line:84%
times said to me, you have
to feel it to heal it.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.165 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
real mastery in that.

00:38:37.165 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:84%
In honoring the
feeling of the pain

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than covering it with
drugs or alcohol or behavior

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.390 align:middle line:84%
that may not serve you
or that you may regret.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to
acknowledge that feeling it

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:84%
is actually a faster track
way to get through it.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't hide from it.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to work
through it and acknowledge

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes it's so bad
you got nothing but tears.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The amount of energy it takes
to hide and suppress any type

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:90%
of trauma is staggering.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're living with
it every single day

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the cost,
the short-term discomfort,

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call
it that, of addressing

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:84%
a trauma, such as sexual abuse,
physical abuse, mental abuse

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that you experienced as a
child, the short-term discomfort

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:84%
it's the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to living

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:90%
with that every single day.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, your
soul is depressed.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit is squashed.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to amplify
you don't get to show up.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to share
all of who you are.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:47.463 align:middle line:84%
And if you think for a moment
that by me hiding my trauma,

00:39:47.463 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
by me not talking about it,
I'm protecting everybody else.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.410 align:middle line:90%
You're living in a cloud.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:90%
You're living on Mars.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because your kids are feeling it
energetically every single day.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They're not sitting
there going, why

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.612 align:middle line:84%
is mom not as alive as
my friend Albert's mom.

00:40:03.612 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Where's the spark in her face?

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
By holding on to trauma,
you're passing it

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.117 align:middle line:84%
on to the next generation,
energetically, spiritually.

00:40:14.117 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know you think you're
doing a good job suppressing

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
it, but you're not.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.378 align:middle line:84%
You're doing a shitty job
suppressing it because it's

00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:90%
taking way too much energy.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.417 align:middle line:84%
And that energy could be
expelled in so many other ways.

00:40:24.417 --> 00:40:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when you hide
your negative emotion,

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you hide trauma, you hide
your gift in there with it.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You put it in a box
and you lock it away.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.205 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our greatest gift
lies right next to our deepest

00:40:34.205 --> 00:40:35.005 align:middle line:90%
wounds.

00:40:35.005 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> On December 14, 2012, that
day started out like any other.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Getting the boys
ready for school.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
ready for work.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking Jesse
out to meet his dad.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember turning around
and giving Jesse a hug.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that he had
written in the frost

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:84%
with his little
fingernail I love you.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:84%
That happened to be
his last picture.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.585 align:middle line:90%
And also, my goodbye message.

00:41:26.585 --> 00:41:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I left for work,
about 45 minutes away.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after I
arrived at work, people

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:84%
started coming up to
my desk and telling me

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.915 align:middle line:90%
that there had been a shooting.

00:41:47.915 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We do have the breaking news
of a shooting at an elementary

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:90%
school in Newtown, Connecticut.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I need units in the
school I got bodies here.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> An angry young man shot his
way through the glass doors

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.225 align:middle line:84%
of Sandy Hook Elementary
and proceeded to gun down 20

00:42:10.225 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
first-graders in two first grade
classrooms and six teachers

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and administrators in one of
the worst mass shootings in US

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard that children
were taken out bloody.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very scared,
worried about my son.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Worried about the other
kids that I know here.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It was terrifying.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm still terrified.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm still in
shock about it all.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.343 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know
everything that happened.

00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very, very difficult
scene for the family members,

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:84%
for all the responding
first responders.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a tragedy.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a tragic scene.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> My son, Jesse Lewis, attended
that school and was in one

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
of those classrooms.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
All the children
had been evacuated,

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and that the parents
were supposed to meet up

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:90%
with them at the firehouse.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So I drove the 45 minutes with
my phone dinging, ringing.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I really got concerned,
really concerned.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for my
little brown headed boy

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:90%
and not finding him.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Neil, his father, is looking.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're texting
back and forth.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.947 align:middle line:90%
Have you checked here?

00:43:16.947 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Have you checked there?

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find him.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Neil left to go
check the hospitals because all

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of the lines were busy.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I finally went
into that back room.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I put his name down on a
list at the very bottom.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I mean, I didn't
think ever in a million years

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.800 align:middle line:90%
that all those people were dead.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:44:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Once the information was in,
it was clear to me that I had

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm in town.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.450 align:middle line:84%
This is 10 minutes
from my house.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I know this technique
that can help

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.230 align:middle line:84%
mitigate some of the trauma
that can help people heal.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Looking around
knowing that tapping

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
is a great technique for
trauma, I was compelled to help.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:84%
My brother Alex and my
sister Jessica and I

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the family
formed the Tapping Solution

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Foundation right then
for that specific purpose

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.620 align:middle line:90%
of helping and healing.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We flew in Dr. Lori
Leyden from California

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.200 align:middle line:84%
who had had a lot of experience
working in Rwanda with genocide

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
survivors, working on trauma
and tapping with them.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up
moving to Connecticut.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Spent the next couple
of years supported

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.057 align:middle line:84%
by the foundation in town
working with people again

00:44:55.057 --> 00:44:55.890 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And we collaboratively
we did that.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.040 align:middle line:90%
We worked together.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Ran workshops.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Worked with people individually.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Some amazing stories of
healing and transformation.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Scarlett Lewis, who has
since become a dear friend.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Rainy, foggy, Tuesday night.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.550 align:middle line:90%
The shooting was on Friday.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But I remember walking
into Scarlett's house.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Scarlett was there.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Her remaining son JT, who
was 12 or 13 at the time.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- traumatized
doesn't describe

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.260 align:middle line:90%
the state that she was in.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like I was attached
to the shooter with an umbilical

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:90%
cord.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And it ran out of my
side and into his.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of my personal
power drained out

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.425 align:middle line:84%
of me in the form of
anger through this cord

00:45:47.425 --> 00:45:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and into the shooter.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.142 align:middle line:90%


00:45:52.142 --> 00:45:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> She had heard about tapping,
had done some Tapping World

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Summit, but hadn't gone deep.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And that night, we
tapped together.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, people often ask about
these situations like, well,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:90%
this happened on Friday.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And what did you do on Tuesday?

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.583 align:middle line:84%
Like, how are you
going to tap this away?

00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we're always like,
oh, tap away the anxiety.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Tap away the anger.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:90%
We didn't tap anything away.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I just looked
to bring her some peace

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and to bring her body
into a state of calm.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.735 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
about that experience

00:46:20.735 --> 00:46:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is we actually tapped
on something else

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like on a Tuesday
after her six-year-old son dies

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:84%
on Friday I'm going to say let's
tap on even though Jesse died.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We tapped on anger
and frustration.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Other things that were
going on in her life

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that were then feeding into
the stress and the anxiety.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So my job in that
moment was, what

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:84%
can I do to just bring
a semblance of peace

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.605 align:middle line:90%
to this suffering individual?

00:46:46.605 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EFT stands for emotional
freedom techniques.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.450 align:middle line:90%
It's also called tapping.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It has you think about
something that bothers you.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you think about
a thing that bothers you,

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.860 align:middle line:84%
you're activating all the
circuits in your brain

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:90%
that carry that information.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So you then have your brain
working in a certain way.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.500 align:middle line:84%
You have certain
circuits lit up.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
things that bother you

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.820 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again, you

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.220 align:middle line:84%
make those circuits bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you interrupt that
pattern with something else,

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.250 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to
break that signaling.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And then your brain no
longer uses that circuit.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And the something else in the
case of EFT is acupressure.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.830 align:middle line:84%
There are over 300 meridian
points of the body.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:34.870 align:middle line:84%
They're organized into
14 meridian lines.

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And EFT has you apply
acupressure in the form

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of a fingertip tapping,
like this, to about 13

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:90%
of those points.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There are seven in the
brief form of EFT and 13

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in the long form of the FT, as
well as using eye movements.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in
people's EEGs and MRIs when

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:84%
they do this is that
your first have them

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.738 align:middle line:90%
think about the problem.

00:47:55.738 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:84%
When they think about the
problem about the event

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.750 align:middle line:84%
in their life, about the bomb
blast, about the car crash,

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.660 align:middle line:84%
about the terrible divorce,
whatever it might be,

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you find the emotional
brain is all lit up.

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:10.260 align:middle line:84%
In an MRI or an EEG, you
see all this activity

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.940 align:middle line:90%
in the emotional midbrain.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.850 align:middle line:84%
When people start tapping,
it sends a second signal

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.650 align:middle line:90%
to the brain of safety.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're being
chased by a tiger,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.460 align:middle line:90%
you would not be tapping.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, the brain's
getting two inputs.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It's getting this signal
from your memory saying,

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
be stressed, be stressed,
danger, danger, danger, danger.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And sending a second single,
a somatic signal of soothing

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:90%
in the form of tapping.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And it prioritizes that soothing
signal just the way your mom,

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.240 align:middle line:84%
when you were crying as a baby,
she would stroke your face.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.950 align:middle line:90%
She would stroke your head.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:90%
She would touch you.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional middle
brains understand touch.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.510 align:middle line:84%
When a friend of
yours is crying,

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:55.040 align:middle line:84%
you don't explain to them why
they shouldn't feel so bad.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.340 align:middle line:84%
You put your arm around them,
and touch will soothe them.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a famous psychiatrist
called Joseph Wolpe.

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.270 align:middle line:84%
After World War
II, he was working

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.130 align:middle line:90%
with veterans of World War II.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And these men, for the most
part men, had shell shock.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:12.148 align:middle line:84%
They were dreadfully
affected by the war.

00:49:12.148 --> 00:49:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was a good
Freudian therapist.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So he laid them on a couch
to do the talking cure.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And said tell me
about Omaha Beach.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And he came to the
realization after doing this

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:84%
with those soldiers, he
said, that kind of therapy

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.390 align:middle line:90%
is not ineffective.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:30.150 align:middle line:90%
It's harmful.

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:34.702 align:middle line:84%
And a later term is
re-traumatizing to remember

00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the bad stuff, to remember
the Pit Bull attack,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.910 align:middle line:84%
remember the car accident,
remember your buddies being

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:90%
blown to bits on the beach.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
By replaying that in your mind,
that thought, now stimulating

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:49.180 align:middle line:84%
that emotion is actually
re-traumatizing you.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you fire those neural
circuits in your brain,

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.430 align:middle line:84%
they wire together bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So we find, for example,
that stress circuits,

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.445 align:middle line:84%
like the amygdala,
grow in people who have

00:50:01.445 --> 00:50:03.010 align:middle line:90%
been traumatized in that way.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And learning and
memory circuits,

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:08.420 align:middle line:84%
like those in the hippocampus,
actually shrink over time.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing brain
remodeling with our thoughts.

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts aren't just
producing some kind of emotion

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:90%
or experience in our minds.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
They're producing neural
tissue in our brains.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to
use that neural tissue

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.370 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again,
then it becomes hard to change.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use
cognitive techniques

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:84%
for developmental trauma
or preverbal trauma.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:90%
You need energy techniques.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.055 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge
numbers of them.

00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We have acupuncture, which
affects the flows of energy

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:90%
in the body's meridians.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We have acupressure,
like EFT, where

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.980 align:middle line:84%
you interrupt that thought and
that experience with pressure

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.430 align:middle line:90%
or tapping on a point.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We have energy medicine,
energy psychology techniques.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And these work below
the level of thought.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They work at the level of
the body's energy system.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:84%
What we see, for example,
on MRI or EEG scans,

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is massive shifts in the
body's usage of energy.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:84%
As you shift the energy of the
body, then the form of the body

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:90%
shifts as well.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Walking back out through
the kitchen and out through

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:13.030 align:middle line:84%
the front door, when I noticed
on our kitchen chalkboard that

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Jesse had written a message
sometime shortly before he

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:90%
died.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.350 align:middle line:90%
He wrote three words--

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:22.540 align:middle line:90%
nurturing, healing, love.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
would be spending

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.300 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life spreading
this message of nurturing

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.230 align:middle line:90%
healing love.

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> She has also locked
into a bigger mission.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's really
exciting about the work

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that she's doing is that she's
creating meaning behind that.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Afterwards, JT and I started
making our own gratitude list

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that we really did
have a lot to be grateful for.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We both talked about the
importance of forgiving.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness, for me, was
a big set of scissors.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I cut that cord that
attached me to pain.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And literally,
almost immediately,

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.530 align:middle line:84%
all my personal power
flowed back into me.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was such a relief.

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true for her.

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, the way she speaks of
it, it is true forgiveness.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, she forgave the man
murdered her six-year-old son

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:84%
in cold blood along
with 19 other children.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't just
say I forgive him.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.770 align:middle line:90%
She did it.

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You just, you know there's
that essence of forgiveness

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.500 align:middle line:90%
in a way that is hard to fathom.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesse had really guided
my direction following

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.230 align:middle line:84%
the shooting with his
chalkboard message.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew
that if Adam Lanza

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:58.920 align:middle line:84%
had been able to give and
receive nurturing healing love,

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that the tragedy would
never have happened.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew that
somebody who could

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:07.850 align:middle line:84%
have done something so
horrible must have been

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in a tremendous amount of pain.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> His Holiness, the Dalai
Lama, people say, you know,

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:30.880 align:middle line:90%
who's your greatest teacher?

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And as the spokesperson
for Buddhism in the West,

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:37.180 align:middle line:84%
the answer has to be the
Buddha is my greatest teacher.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And what does he say?

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:44.290 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese who bludgeoned
with ax handles 2 million

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of his followers, right?

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's his greatest teacher.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So for me, owning your life
means reframing it to say,

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm here today.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have this
kind of relationship

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.310 align:middle line:84%
with my parents or this person,
or this was humiliating.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But instead of fighting
reality, a reality

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.020 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
change, the sooner

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you own it is the
sooner you'll let

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.640 align:middle line:90%
go of all those resentments.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.200 align:middle line:90%
And those resentments are now--

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the adage from the 12-step
program, resentment

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
is like poking
yourself in the eye

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for your
parents to go blind.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:23.260 align:middle line:90%
You're only poisoning yourself.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have to forgive
all these people.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Forgiveness is
critically important.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And we often forget
about forgiveness.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think that you can't
really have peace in your life

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:84%
if there's someone that you have
not forgiven because it creates

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.080 align:middle line:90%
an energy blockage.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.040 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so energy can't
flow if you're

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.080 align:middle line:90%
stopping that forgiveness.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be that
you need to forgive

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.890 align:middle line:90%
you, yourself, for something.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all do stupid things.

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.132 align:middle line:90%
But forgiveness is possible.

00:54:51.132 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we found
is that sometimes people who

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:58.060 align:middle line:84%
cannot forgive someone
who's really wronged them,

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:84%
find that when they remove
the emotional baggage around

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:84%
the event or around the person,
they are able to move to that

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.610 align:middle line:84%
point where they can
forgive and move on.

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:13.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Forgiveness is a wonderful
gift to give to somebody else.

00:55:13.202 --> 00:55:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But forgiveness is probably
one of the greatest

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.720 align:middle line:90%
gifts you can give to yourself.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding a
grudge to somebody else,

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.098 align:middle line:84%
you're paying the
price every single day.

00:55:21.098 --> 00:55:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing you need
to realize is that you have

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:24.490 align:middle line:90%
emotional baggage.

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, but you do.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to start
getting rid of that baggage.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the studies in
my book "Minds Matter"

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.750 align:middle line:84%
compares the lifespan of
optimists versus pessimists.

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.532 align:middle line:84%
People have a cheery and
positive frame for their lives.

00:55:38.532 --> 00:55:40.490 align:middle line:84%
They had all the same
problems as other people.

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.157 align:middle line:84%
They may have been
fired from their job.

00:55:42.157 --> 00:55:43.690 align:middle line:84%
They may have had
a financial crash.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But they have an optimistic
take on the world.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It compares their
lifespan to pessimists.

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in
lifespan is eight years.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Those optimists live eight
years longer than pessimists.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And those aren't
eight years spent

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.210 align:middle line:84%
on a respirator
in a nursing home.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Those are eight
healthy years as well.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also important to
realize that our emotions that

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.500 align:middle line:84%
come up for us are messengers
from the subconscious.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But that we also
have the opportunity

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to experience
whatever's coming up,

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.810 align:middle line:84%
but then change that
into a different emotion,

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:17.710 align:middle line:90%
a positive emotion.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a whole
palette of positive emotions

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.030 align:middle line:90%
that we can choose from.

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Personal growth and
psychology have been making

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental error
for a century.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is we measure
how sick people are.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I go into a
psychologist with anxiety,

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.360 align:middle line:84%
they'll measure
my anxiety level.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And if my treatment's
successful,

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll have zero anxiety
at the end of it.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're measuring
depression, anxiety, and pain.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:90%
And the goal is zero.

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.120 align:middle line:90%
But we don't want zero.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
just have no pain

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.970 align:middle line:90%
and no anxiety no depression.

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:51.760 align:middle line:90%
We want to have vibrant health.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.100 align:middle line:90%
We want ecstasy every day.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.210 align:middle line:84%
The new science of personal
growth, the new human potential

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.980 align:middle line:90%
is what's above zero.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And how high above
zero can we go?

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
way above zero.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:22.925 align:middle line:84%
We can achieve ecstatic states
in meditation and by tapping

00:57:22.925 --> 00:57:23.925 align:middle line:90%
and reducing our stress.

00:57:23.925 --> 00:57:26.440 align:middle line:90%


00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So ask yourself this
question, who would you

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.810 align:middle line:84%
be if you didn't
have your own story?

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
If you were free of all the
things that hold you back.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.990 align:middle line:90%
You could soar.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:41.140 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence showing
that we human beings

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.140 align:middle line:90%
have remarkable capacities.

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're just beginning
to exercise them.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I always say moment by
moment, breath by breath,

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:53.800 align:middle line:90%
day by day.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
moments I haven't, I

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.972 align:middle line:84%
will then remind myself I
just got through that moment.

00:57:58.972 --> 00:58:00.160 align:middle line:90%
So in fact, I have.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.950 align:middle line:90%
You are still here.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:05.410 align:middle line:84%
You have gone through the
worst moments in your life.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in
hindsight, when we look

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.740 align:middle line:84%
back at those times that have
been really challenging, I

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.530 align:middle line:84%
would almost suggest
that anything that's

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:17.410 align:middle line:84%
been challenging to you in your
life that you look back on,

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.100 align:middle line:84%
when you look back
on it with hindsight,

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.520 align:middle line:84%
you could almost say,
yes, it was a gift.

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Or it is because of
that I have actually

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.040 align:middle line:84%
created this in my life,
or I've become that,

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.670 align:middle line:84%
or I have met this person,
or I have studied there.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:33.097 align:middle line:84%
There is a gift in
every challenge.

00:58:33.097 --> 00:58:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just whether or
not we're willing to be

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:36.970 align:middle line:84%
open to having the
perception that we

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:39.370 align:middle line:84%
deserve the truth
and the pathway

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to finding that
new way of being.

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you it is
through the powerful mastery

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:49.470 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual leaders that
they will also say that that

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:50.680 align:middle line:90%
as part of the pathway.

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Struggle is the pathway to self,
to god, to universe, to source.
