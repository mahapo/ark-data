00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.952 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everybody.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm Peta Stapleton.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
It's so lovely to be
here with you today.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm a clinical and health
psychologist and also

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:10%
an associate professor in
psychology at Bonn University,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
Queensland, Australia.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done for
the last, at least,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
dozen years, since
about 2010, is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
research a technique called
EFT, or Emotional Freedom

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Techniques.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Which sounds like a mouthful.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has sort of become known
as something called tapping.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Because that really describes
what we do in this technique.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what it is
is a stress reduction tool.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So it has been proven now-- and
we'll talk about that today--

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
how it actually affects
stress in the body,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
not only at a hormone
level, but other physiology.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So we've really got this
stress-reduction tool that uses

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
accupoints-- so
acupressure points--

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And because we tap on them
with two fingers instead

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
of using needles like
traditional acupuncture does,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that's where this term "tapping"
has actually come from.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.187 align:middle line:84%
So we have Emotional Freedom
Techniques, EFT, or tapping.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And so today, I really
want to share with you what

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
it is, how it works, the
research and evidence that

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
has actually been gathering
over the last decade,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and then how to use it
for really common things,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
ideally, stress and worry.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.915 align:middle line:84%
Because that's such a big common
thing in everyone's lives.

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then how it can
actually be applied to so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:90%
many other different areas.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The one thing we've
learned in psychology

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is that stress seems to underlie
so many different things

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And if can do something
about stress--

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and tapping is a perfect
solution for that--

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually think more
clearly, make better decisions,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, people then
have responses physically

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.675 align:middle line:84%
with things like chronic pain
and different sort of disorders

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So it is this
stress-reduction tool.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It's this technique
that we self apply.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So while somebody could actually
teach you how to do tapping,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:90%
we actually self apply it.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we actually have children
as young as four and five

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
years of age who can be taught
how to use tapping as well.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when we use
tapping with little ones,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:90%
it's a faster process.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They tend not to
have as many layers

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:90%
that they need to deal with.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of minutes, they

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
can actually be
skipping out the door.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.747 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it
was that they were

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
worried about after a couple
of rounds of tapping has gone.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So we tap on these pressure
points that are on the body.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And we actually use some words
in conjunction with that.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So at an academic,
health point of view,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
we actually talk
about EFT or tapping

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
being a psycho-physiological
technique.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have this psychology
element of this cognitive--

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:90%
the words that we say.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's really quite mindful.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.443 align:middle line:84%
So when we get into
tapping, it appears

00:03:03.443 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
as though we're tapping on the
negative a lot of the time.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
saying our problem,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
which is really counterintuitive
to a lot of psychology

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
techniques, when
you think about it.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not a positive
mindset, reframe.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not that type
of affirmation.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's more about,
what is my problem?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
state it out loud.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we stay
really present and mindful.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
The ingredient here
that's really important

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is we actually have to tap
on the acupressure points.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So tapping on the
pressure points

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
while we state what's
happening for us sends

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
a signal back to the part of the
brain sending out that stress

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.353 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we know
through research calms down.

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:10%
So if we walked through
the process now,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:10%
we would typically
only do EFT or tapping

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:10%
when we have a problem.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We will talk at
some point about,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
how can I use it
for the positive?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But, really, it's a technique
to reduce stress or distress

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of any level.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So we would actually frame
our problem in a sentence.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to use the
same formula all the time.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the sentence really
goes along the lines of,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
even though I have
this problem, whatever

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
it might be, I accept
that I have this problem.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, the end of that
phrase can be changed.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
It can be whatever it is
that somebody wants to say.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The traditional
way of doing EFT,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
back when it actually
first came about,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
was to say something like, even
though I have this problem,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I deeply and completely
love and accept myself.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And many people might
be familiar with that.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if that feels
comfortable to a lot of people,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:90%
you can absolutely say that.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But all it really is
about stating the problem

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and accepting, I have
this problem right now.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
The tapping is the part
that does something

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
about that problem, which
is what we're all after.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.948 align:middle line:10%
So it's really about,
I have this problem,

00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:10%
I accept I have it,
but I'm now going

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:10%
to do something with that.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So as we state our
sentence, we tend

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to tack on the side of
the hand point here.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time, we
tap with our dominant hand

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and with two fingers.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would tap on the
side of the hand point

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.232 align:middle line:90%
as we state our sentence.

00:04:57.232 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, that
sentence, if I just

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
for a moment focus on something
like, "I feel overwhelmed,"

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say, "even though I
feel overwhelmed right now,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way."

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We tend to say it
three times just

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
to get in that present moment.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:10%
So even though I feel
overwhelmed at the moment,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:10%
I accept I feel this way.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel
overwhelmed at the moment,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.702 align:middle line:10%
And then after we've
set that statement up,

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:10%
we come to the very first
pressure point, which

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:10%
is the start of the eyebrow.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So we actually tap there
with the two fingers.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we would say
is a shortened version.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to be
focused on the feeling,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:90%
this overwhelmed feeling.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So I would just say a short
word out of my sentence.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
The next point is the side of
the eye where it does dip in.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And we would say,
"this overwhelm."

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The next point is under
the eye, on the bone.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And again, we would tap there
and say, "this overwhelm."

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The next point is
actually under the nose.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:90%
This overwhelm.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:10%
So you can see I'm
repeating and staying

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:10%
present with how I feel.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The next point is on the chin,
the crease there, tapping.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I feel overwhelmed.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:10%
The next point is
under the collarbone.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.143 align:middle line:84%
So if you come to the
ends of the collarbone

00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and come down about an inch,
you can tap on one side.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Some people like to tap
on both with both fingers.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We tap there and say,
"this overwhelm."

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:90%
The next point is under the arm.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's about four inches
down from the armpit.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to measure
down, it's about there.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We tap there and say,
"this overwhelm."

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And the last point is the
dead center of the head.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So we would tap
in the dead center

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%
there and say, "this overwhelm."

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call a
cycle or a round of tapping.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's a single round.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
We ask people to take a breath
at that point and just tune in.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
If it was something physically
that you were tapping on

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.413 align:middle line:84%
that you could feel,
even if it was emotional,

00:06:51.413 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
you could tune into that
to see, how does that

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:90%
feel at the moment?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we work
out that it's actually

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
having any shift or impact is
to give it a number out of 10.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So 10 represents the most
distress you would ever feel.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And 0 represents, I'm
completely calm and relaxed,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:90%
this is not a problem.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the
time, you can guess.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
If I guessed what my
level was out of 10,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
a number might
just come to mind.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to question it.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just
think, how does it

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
feel if 10 was the
worst and 0 was calm?

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So as we tap through
each round, we

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
would come back in and check,
how do I feel at the moment?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So what number would I give
this out of 10 right now?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's not
somewhere near a 0 or a 1,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
we would repeat the round by
coming back to the eyebrow

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
point and tap again.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
So "this overwhelm."

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And we would continue
through all the points

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
until we got back to taking that
breath and checking in again.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Has anything else come to
mind, which sometimes occurs?

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
What number will I
give it out of 10?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as we continue
through that process,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
most people are quite astounded
at how fast it actually

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
works for them to
suddenly be in a space,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
after maybe five rounds
of tapping, which may only

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.130 align:middle line:84%
take five minutes, to
suddenly feel much calmer.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.165 align:middle line:84%
And signs of relaxation
or that number of 0 or a 1

00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:90%
tend to be things like yawning.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So yawning and tapping
is the only time

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
as a therapist we
don't get offended.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Because our clients
aren't bored.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a sign of
a neurological shift.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
So as we're tapping,
if we find we

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:10%
do want to start yawning, and
sometimes, every now and again,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:10%
spontaneous laughter
will be a sign, as well.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But yawning is the
most common one.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
People will start to yawn and
even have a cognitive shift,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
like, I don't know why this
was such a bother to me 5,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes ago.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I
was worried about it.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They might even
also say, it seems

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
like it's much more
distant from me now

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I could
think more clearly

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.395 align:middle line:90%
about that problem.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all of those are
a sign that tapping is actually

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at any
point, if anyone

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
felt they needed any more
professional assistance,

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of course, worldwide, there are
practitioners that can actually

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.197 align:middle line:84%
help people if
they want to use it

00:09:01.197 --> 00:09:02.533 align:middle line:90%
for different types of things.

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we talk
about the research,

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
we will talk about
how, indeed, it

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
can help so many different
psychological conditions as

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:90%
well as physical ones.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
that's self applied.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Children as young as
4 and 5 can actually

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
use this as well,
of course right

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.115 align:middle line:90%
through to 95 years of age.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we've
had lots of people

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
in our clinical
trials over the years

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
be in those age categories
getting the benefit

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.357 align:middle line:90%
from tapping as well.

00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It can be applied to so many
different areas, everything

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
from stress, like
we said, but right

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
through to chronic pain, as
well as psychological disorders.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go through
some of those today.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:90%
