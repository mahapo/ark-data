00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:26.838 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Another way tapping can
actually be used is to change

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.797 align:middle line:10%
lift circumstances.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
So we've talked a
little bit about how

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
to use tapping for
goal setting and things

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:10%
like that, even performance.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But often, people want to
change a life circumstance.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And a really good example
is something like abundance.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, "abundance" means different
things to different people.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
That could mean a state of
well-being for somebody.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But it could mean a financial
position for others.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And often, life circumstances
like that come about

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But tapping can actually
be used to shift them.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So we know that even
behavior patterns that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
might be set up in
younger childhood

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:90%
are still responsive to tapping.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
All it is is about
working out, where

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
did this come from, what
might have contributed,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps, what it
was that I learned,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
even as a younger person,
that may have cemented

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:84%
or confirmed a
belief in my life?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:10%
So Gary Craig, the
originator of EFT,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:10%
said, back in the
beginning, that it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:10%
was like we're all born into
a palace of possibilities.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're born into
this enormous palace.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:90%
And every room is open to us.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But because we're in such
a hypnotic brainwave state

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for that first 10 or
so years of our life,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
we take on other
people's messages.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So we definitely
adopt, very easily

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and without questioning,
repetitive messages.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And often, in a life area such
as wealth, money, abundance,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
we will naturally adopt,
just by being there,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that our primary
people around us believe.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Often, what we believe we say--

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
so the words we say--
are our thoughts.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
And if they're repetitive
enough, we adopt them.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is an area that a
lot of people want to change

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
but don't realize that
EFT can be part of that.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So Gary said, we start to
write all these sayings,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
family sayings, maybe
about wealth and abundance,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
on the walls in the palace.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And they become a
bit too overwhelming.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So by the time we get
to being an adult,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
all these rooms have
got all these family

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.008 align:middle line:90%
sayings written all over them.

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to go
into those rooms anymore.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.088 align:middle line:84%
And we end up living in a palace
in this tiny little room that

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
hasn't gotten anything written
in it because we're too scared

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to go out there.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So family sayings were a
really good place to start.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not
a blame exercise.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Our parents only
do what they knew.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:10%
We only do, as a
parent, what we know.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we only teach what
we know to our children.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way of finding
out, what did I grow up with?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So if he did want to change,
let's say, for example,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the amount of money that
comes into your life

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.793 align:middle line:90%
on a monthly basis--

00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
so you could write
down right now,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
if you knew or could
guess, what that amount

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
that comes into my life?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason, if you
wanted that to increase,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
you've just got to work out,
what are the reasons it can't?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So we talked in our
goal-setting video

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
that, often, we have this
committee in our head

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that tells us all
these one liners.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same
with family sayings.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.147 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to set a goal,
you'll work some of those out.

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll hear
that voice saying,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:84%
you can't have that
goal come true.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to do
the same thing around,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
well, what if I wanted to
double the amount of money that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
comes into my life on a monthly
basis, that currently does,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:90%
what would that do for me?

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, people will
say, that's a positive thing.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
What is the reason that,
perhaps, you can't, or that you

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
don't currently?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
What messages did you grow
up with about money, wealth,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that type of thing
in the family?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And write them all down.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:10%
So typically, in a
workshop situation,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:10%
we will ask everybody's
ideas around this.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of things we
hear go along these lines.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with the message that
money doesn't grow on trees.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Other messages, who do you
think I am, Rockefeller?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Other things like,
the rich get richer,

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:90%
and the poor get poorer.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
Concepts about
money, how money's

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
described, that money's
dirty, and after you've

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
touched coins or notes, you
need to go and wash your hands.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, those messages
might be about hygiene

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
for the mom and the dad.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But what messages might they
become for somebody else,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps "dirty
money" becomes a concept

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
in somebody else's life.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, wanting
more of it doesn't

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:90%
make you a better person.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It might make you
a worse person.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What are the messages,
perhaps, if we

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
thought about that area
of wealth creation,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
abundance, in your own life,
that maybe you grew up with?

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So Gary Craig said
tapping is the eraser.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the paint to go into
the other rooms of the palace

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and paint them over
or rub them out.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So tapping is about
working out, OK,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
what is it here that
I've grown up with?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Going and visiting
family, if you're able to,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
is always a really
lovely experiment

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that they don't know about.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you get to hear
what people talk about.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, if
any of those beliefs

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
are often still being
held in yourself,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear your
mother, or your father,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.828 align:middle line:84%
or your siblings reflect them
back in their conversation.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
anything that you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.908 align:middle line:84%
do here is an opportunity
for you to go, hmm,

00:05:34.908 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
there's another one I
could write down on my list

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:90%
to take home and tap on today.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So if, for the purpose
of this exercise,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
we were just to think about--

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
let's just think about
something as simple as money.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
If we were to
almost write a goal

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
or just have a bit of a thought
at the moment about doubling

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:84%
your income, your
monthly income,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
so whatever it currently is,
where does that feel for you?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Is there a level of discomfort
about whether or not

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
that can happen for you?

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And what might be
the family sayings

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
about that particular
area, that life

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
circumstance of just how much
money you have in your life?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's about the car
that you set a goal around,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.222 align:middle line:84%
the house that you would like
to live in, that type of thing.

00:06:21.222 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to think
about that and just tune

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
in for a moment about,
if I was to think

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
about just doubling
my monthly income,

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
how does that make me feel?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it makes you
feel fine, and you

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
think that's
perfectly achievable,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:90%
triple the amount of money.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We want to reach a point
here where, at some level,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel,
that's not possible.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what we do
we our tapping on.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a small
exercise to work out.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But remember, sometimes, it's
just the tip of the iceberg .

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We might think of
things as we go along.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's do some tapping
just to get this going

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and maybe just to start
some of these thoughts.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So just repeating after me.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm
thinking about doubling

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
my income on a monthly basis,
I'm not sure I could do that.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do that.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though, when I think
about doubling my income,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I feel uncomfortable,
I'm definitely

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
hearing someone else's
voice in my head.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have this
level of uncomfortableness,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe this can't
happen, I know there's

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:90%
family beliefs about this.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm open to changing today.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Up to the eyebrow.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:10%
This level of discomfort, this
is not a comfortable feeling.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I definitely know there's
family sayings here.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
My beliefs about money,
this uncomfortable feeling,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:90%
these beliefs about money--

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
under the arm-- all of
these beliefs and feelings,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm open to learning
where they came from.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
And just take a deep breath.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And maybe just check in.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever feeling that you
may have been focusing on,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
whether you feel it
physically in your body

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
or you just know there's
something that's not quite

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
right there, if you were to
give it a number out of 10,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:90%
where is that?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
What's the number?

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:90%
What's coming to mind?

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
In tapping around these
kind of life areas,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
we really are looking
for things that you

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:90%
may have heard growing up.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
We are looking for beliefs.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And beliefs adapt
with tapping as easily

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
as a feeling or a
sensation in the body does.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Just about focusing what it is.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a belief now that
perhaps it's not possible.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you can relate
that to anything

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that you heard growing up,
think of that specifically.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So up to the eyebrow point.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
this is possible.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:90%
My beliefs about this.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
This belief that
it's not possible.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Under the noise.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:90%
My beliefs about money.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:90%
On the chin point.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
These beliefs that I have.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Collarbone.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:90%
These beliefs about money.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:90%
All of these beliefs.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
This uncomfortable feeling
and all of my beliefs.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And just check where
that feels at the moment.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And take note.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Write them down if you need to.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Take note of what
else is coming up.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as the
amygdala gets calmer,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
the hippocampus opens
up our memory center.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, as we tap
on these types of ideas,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
we do start to
think about things.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And even if it was
5 years ago or 15,

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
make a note of what they are.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And we can come back to them.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But let's do one more round
of tapping where we just start

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to notice the
connection, perhaps,

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
to what we learnt growing up
so that we can actually detach

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
from that.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Back to the eyebrow point.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe these beliefs aren't mine.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:10%
I was taught to think this way.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:10%
Under the eye.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:10%
But maybe I could let it go.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
These beliefs that
I was taught--

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:90%
on the chin point--

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:90%
that's all they knew.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Collarbone.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they're
not my beliefs.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps I could be open
to letting them go.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.510 align:middle line:84%
These beliefs that were taught
to me, that I wish to let

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:90%
go of.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, just giving
yourself permission

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:10%
to let go of a family pattern,
a family theme, a family way

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:10%
of being, is all that we need.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is, just
remember the family sayings

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and the writings on your wall.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And tapping could become the
tool to actually erase those.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:90%
