[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:10%
>> So we're going to talk
about, how could tapping be used

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:10%
for something as common
as sleeping issues?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
We do know that insomnia is
quite prevalent across lots

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:90%
of different ages.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So it could be around stressful,
transient times in life.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, I know children
going from primary school

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:90%
to high school.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And they actually have sort
of sleep disturbed there.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, new job changes
or changes in life.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And then as we say
hormone changes

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that occur for older adults, we
see insomnia as side effects.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of those reasons don't
mean that we can't use tapping.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, there have
been a few published research

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
trials on insomnia and
how it can be used.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I might share with
you some common reasons that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
contribute to primary
insomnia and how

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:90%
we could actually use that.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, you'll
probably do this in bed.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So it is one of the
nice times that you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
could do tapping in bed.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
If you found that you were
disturbing somebody else,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:84%
you may want to get out
of bed and go and sit

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.012 align:middle line:84%
in a chair somewhere
in a private room.

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it is
something that you

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
would do if you woke up in
the middle of the night.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
common contributors

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to primary insomnia, where we
are talking, even though it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
is a clinical issue,
it doesn't have

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
any secondary issues
attached to it,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:84%
EG, medical conditions
that might be contributing.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So primary insomnia
typically might be

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:90%
due to things like racing mind.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:90%
So people go to bed.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
certainly can relate

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to this, that you've had a
busy day, lots that's happened,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
lots of family, lots of
work, lots to commitments.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when you get your
downtime and your quiet time

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
at night, that's when your
brain takes its opportunity

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to start to do some processing,
which might not ideally

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
fit with the sleep that you're
trying to get for the next day

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to start again.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So definitely racing
mind, anxious thoughts,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.058 align:middle line:84%
worry thoughts even,
those types of things.

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So we can use tapping
for that, which

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
we'll have a look at today.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It can certainly
be used for things

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
like getting to sleep, even
if there's no racing mind,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that you just find you
lie there rolling around

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps have
become in a bad habit

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of not going to sleep till
midnight, that type of thing.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Or even early morning
wakening, so a lot of people

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:90%
will fall asleep quite easily.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But then something perhaps wakes
them around 2:00 or 3:00 AM.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It's too early to get up.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they don't
want to start their day.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
go back to sleep

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:90%
to get a full sleep cycle.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, tapping
can be used there.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So several different ways.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
People that have
chronic pain also

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
have insomnia many, many
times and will often

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
use tapping to
actually, if they are

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
awakened by pain, to
put themselves back

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to sleep as well.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a
non-medication-based,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
but a self-soothing,
technique that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
will reduce stress and
just help you relax

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
to be able to go back to sleep.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.488 align:middle line:84%
So I thought today we might have
a go at just some general ways

00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that we can use tapping and
some words that we can say.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Of course, remember,
specific words

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
relevant to your situation
are always the best.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So anything that I'm saying
that doesn't quite hit the mark,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
feel free to substitute
that for the word

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%
that best describes you.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.625 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you were
in the moment,

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps you
were there, we'll

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.387 align:middle line:90%
talk racing mind to start with.

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And you were having worrying
thoughts, or anxious,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
or you were just planning
the next day ahead,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
you could give that
a rating out of 10.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.555 align:middle line:84%
So you could definitely
say, how much is this

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:90%
bothering me at the moment?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.295 align:middle line:84%
How much am I bothered that
I'm not going to sleep?

00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not watching the clock.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.725 align:middle line:90%
And time's ticking on.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Give it a rating out of 10.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.392 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you could start.

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a typical
set-up statement

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that might relate to having
worrying, anxious, racing

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:90%
thoughts.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So something like this as
you're sitting or lying

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
in bed at night.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm trying to
get to sleep, my mind is racing.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I just can't relax.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Even though my mind is racing,
I have so much to think about.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And I can't get to sleep.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Even though my mind is racing
with all of these thoughts,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm choosing to
do something about it.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So up to the eyebrow
point and tapping there.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
These racing thoughts--
side of the eye--

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I can't get to sleep.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:10%
These racing
thoughts in my mind.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Under the nose.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:10%
I can't get to sleep.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:10%
On the chin point.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:10%
My racing, anxious mind.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:10%
Collarbone.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:10%
I can't get to sleep.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
These racing, anxious thoughts.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't get to sleep.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So take in your deep breath.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you
would be there at night

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and just checking
in with yourself

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:90%
to see what's happening.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Is there a particular
thought that's bothering you?

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
If there is, that's where
you could take your tapping.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
If there was a particular
worry that was bothering you,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
that's where you
should focus your mind,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
rather than, I
can't get to sleep.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
If there isn't
anything specifically,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
you may just want to continue
your tapping by focusing on,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't relax, I
can't get to sleep,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't quiet my mind
enough to get to sleep.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.213 align:middle line:84%
So let's do one round of tapping
on that particular topic.

00:05:52.213 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But remember, if there was
something particularly worrying

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
you, that's where
the words should go.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:10%
So back to the eyebrow point.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:90%
I can't quiet my mind.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:90%
My mind is too busy.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I can't relax to go to sleep.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:10%
My racing mind.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:10%
On the chin point.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:10%
I can't get to sleep.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:10%
Under the collarbone point.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:10%
This racing mind of mine.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't relax to go to sleep.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Top of the head.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
This racing mind of mine.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath in.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you would check
in, see how that feels,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
give your relaxation
level a rating out of 10

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
as you're lying there
at night to see,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
how close am I here
to be able to let go

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and drift off to sleep?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
We'll do one more random
tapping for this particular area

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:90%
of insomnia.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Because after a
few tapping rounds,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
you can start to be suggestive
to your mind of what

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:90%
you would like it to do.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you do find you're
starting to let go

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're relaxing, you
could introduce some words

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:90%
to give your mind the idea.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And we would err on
the side of calling

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
this more positive
tapping, where

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
you can give your
mind the idea of what

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:90%
it is that you're after.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So back to the
eyebrow point here.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to relax.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I could easily drift off.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to relax.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:10%
I could have a restful night.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Chin point.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to relax.

00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Collarbone.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting go.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for a restful sleep.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm ready to drift off.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
If you got that
far, you may have

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.385 align:middle line:84%
found that you've fallen
asleep before you get there.

00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But of course, a
couple of rounds

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
of being suggestive
to the brain,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
too, particularly as
we're drifting off

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
into some of those nice theta,
delta-theta brainwave states

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that are leading us
into that sleep cycle,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
you can actually incorporate
into some of those final rounds

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of tapping.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So definitely addressing the
sleep issue to begin with.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:90%
What's the worry?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:90%
What's the stress?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.408 align:middle line:84%
What's the reason that you
actually aren't asleep?

00:08:31.408 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a couple of
rounds of the body starting

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to relax, start to
introduce some ideas there

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.653 align:middle line:84%
of what it is that you
would like to achieve.

00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, if
you were to wake

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night for
a noise or a different reason,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.350 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even to
use the bathroom,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.293 align:middle line:84%
and then you find you can't
get back to sleep, of course,

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you can use tapping for
that type of thing, as well.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.585 align:middle line:84%
So many different applications
that we can actually

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:90%
use tapping for.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is such a
common area that even

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
children could be
taught how to use

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
tapping to put
themselves back to sleep

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:90%
