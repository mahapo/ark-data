00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:10%
>> One of my most favorite ways
to actually use tapping these

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
days in my life--

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:10%
and it's still a way
of uncovering whatever

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
I need to do my tapping on--

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:10%
is to actually use
it to set goals.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.455 align:middle line:84%
So lots of the
time, particularly

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
at the start of a
new year, people

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.073 align:middle line:84%
will often have an intention
for the year or a goal

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that they would
like to come true.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call
them resolutions.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Often, we know we
will sabotage those.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Again, it can be unconsciously.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere, within enough
time, maybe a month or two down

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
the track, we'd slip back
to our old way of being,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
because that is
what's normal for us.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
That's our habitual
way of being.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So often, we might find a
perfectly legitimate excuse

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
for why the goal
didn't come true.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And more often than not,
that's to reassure ourselves

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that we're not a failure,
that type of thing.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Or we don't tell
anybody about a goal,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, that we set,
because it didn't come true.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So tapping is a
really lovely way

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to find out what is getting
in the road here of a goal,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:90%
can I clear that with tapping--

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk
about that today--

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course, give
myself the best possible chance

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
in my life for that to actually
come to fruition or eventuate.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really lovely way to
introduce tapping to teenagers

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps think you're a
little bit strange, wanting

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
them to tap on pressure
points on their face,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
because lots of teens will often
have something that they wish

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
would come true.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a wish,
a goal, an intention,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
What it does in this
process, though,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
is it reveals to us
any limiting beliefs

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that we may have left
over or that we're still

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:90%
storing from our childhood.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in that first
10 to 12 years of our life,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
we're in quite a
hypnotic brainwave state.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
We are very open
to all the messages

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
that we are hearing
around us that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
might come from our primary
caregivers, our educators,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
anyone that's influential
in those first dozen years.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
That is purely physiological.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
So whatever messages we hear--

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and often, they're
not on purpose--

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but the negative ones that
might get installed or implanted

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
have just come from what
our parents or our teachers

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
have learned themselves.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So they pass on
exactly the same thing.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%
What it is, though,
is an opportunity

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of what they are
and, in our own goal-setting,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:90%
use tapping to clear those.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So if I asked you right now just
to have a think about something

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that you would
like to come true,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
just to actually
have a think about.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.267 align:middle line:84%
And often a way that you
could write it down--

00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
writing goals down has been
shown to actually make them

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
more concrete and make them
more specific for you--

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.967 align:middle line:84%
is to often write
them in present tense.

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to think
about it like this--

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
you were to write your
goal like, it is now--

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and pick a date.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
You can guess a
date, pick a date.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the end of the
goal is what happened--

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
"And I," and then
whatever it is.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.365 align:middle line:84%
So you're writing it as though
it already has come true.

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can make yourself
uncomfortable here

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.167 align:middle line:84%
by writing a goal that
you absolutely think

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:90%
is not going to come true.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's all right to write one
that stretches you a little bit.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And it does work
better with tapping

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:90%
if you pick one of those goals.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
There's two things
we can do here

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
for tapping with
goals, is one, we

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:90%
can tap on our level of doubt.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So often, if we have a
goal, we've written it down,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and we say it out
loud to ourselves.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
It is now the 30th
of November, 2021,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm walking along
the beach in Hawaii,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm staying at
a six-star hotel.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Do I have any doubt
that might come true?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, I give it
a number out of 10.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So 0 is no doubt, and
10 is the most doubt.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
If I sort of have a
doubt level of about 7,

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:90%
I can purely tap on doubt.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So I can just tap
on, even though I

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
have this doubt about that
goal with Hawaii coming true,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
there's no way I'm going to
stay in a five-star hotel.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can tap on
my doubt, my doubt.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the doubt will
start to decrease,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
because when doubt becomes
really low, and, for you,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
it feels like no, I
don't have any doubt,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of any reasons
that can't come true,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
then you know that you're much
more aligned with that goal,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.005 align:middle line:84%
and you're removing
any obstacles.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So we call them roadblocks.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.172 align:middle line:90%
What are your roadblocks?

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:90%
So doubt is a roadblock.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So doubt is one
that we can tap on.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The second one that we can do
is read the goal out loud again,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
read it out loud, but then
just go quiet for a moment

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the internal
voices in your head.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, often, we have this little
committee of voices in our head

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that we've gathered
over the years.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And the committee could
be family members.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It could be friends
that are well-meaning.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It could be people
from the past.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.345 align:middle line:90%
It could be current people.

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're the people
that are well-meaning,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
but they're the
voices in our head

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that tell us something
can't come true.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And normally, that's
to try and protect us,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's something different
and outside our comfort zone.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So if I go back
to my Hawaii goal,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
it is now the 30th
of November, 2021,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm walking along
the beach in Hawaii,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm staying in a
beautiful six-star hotel.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, if I go
quiet, and I listen,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
what thoughts might come
to mind that tell me

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:90%
it can't come true?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I need a piece of
paper at this point,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
because I might have a few.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
If there was anything like,
how are you possibly going

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to afford that, I would write
that down on my piece of paper.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I might have another little
voice inside me that says,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
no one in the family has
ever traveled overseas.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't even have a passport.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
These are all my
roadblocks that are

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
my little voices inside my head
that these are the things that

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
actually act as the sabotage
that we try to consciously use

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
willpower to move beyond
them, but within time,

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.208 align:middle line:84%
your activating system
there in the brain

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:90%
will just bring you back.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.292 align:middle line:84%
It'll wait patiently until you
kind of run out of willpower.

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And it'll bring you back
to the way things are,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which is that goal
doesn't come true for you.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So however many-- and
there might be only three.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
There might be half a dozen.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
There could be 25
different-- and they're often

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
little one-liners.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to afford that?

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
No one in the family's
ever traveled?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
We write them all down.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is, we
actually tap on each of those

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
separately.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So we come back to
our set-up statement,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and we say the sentence
of what we wrote down

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:90%
in the set-up statement.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So it might be, even though
I don't think this goal

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
will come true because
no one in my family

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
has ever traveled overseas,
who do I think I am?

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And so what we would
tap on is any feeling

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.867 align:middle line:84%
associated with that, that
no one has ever done this.

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:90%
No one has ever done this.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Who do I think I am?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we keep tapping on
those until we read that,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's no charge, or
there's no number out of 10,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like it's a
neutral statement to us then.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we move on to the
next one and the next one.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And that process might
take a little bit of time.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You might find you don't have
to actually tap on all of them.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Tapping tends to have a
generalization effect, where

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
when we tap on the ones that
are the strongest to start with,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
all of them are related
that we've written down,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.738 align:middle line:84%
so we tend not to have
to tap on all the others

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
because they do
collapse along the way.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's always good to sort
of start with the ones that

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
are really the strongest.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So you might find that
tapping on five of those

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
gets you to a point where
you're like, no, I do--

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I think this is possible for me.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:90%
How could this not happen?

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.965 align:middle line:90%
I've got no doubt.

00:07:33.965 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
little committee

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:90%
in my head telling me anything.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It's actually gone all quiet.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I actually feel like
this is a possibility.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, to be in that
state means you

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.282 align:middle line:84%
will be in a very
different thought

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
state, a very different
emotional state, a very

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.803 align:middle line:90%
different energetic state.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then what
happens in your life,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
we have to wait to see.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, people
come back to us and say,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
you won't believe it,
but my goal came true.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I do believe
it, because you did.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:90%
And it comes down to belief.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.072 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.072 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:10%
So what I thought
we might do today

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.310 align:middle line:10%
is at least start the
process by tapping on doubt.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So I do have a goal that I'm
thinking of in my own mind.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm tapping on
doubt about that.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So if all of you were to
think now about something

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:90%
you would like to come true--

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
pick something that at least
has some level of doubt for you,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.118 align:middle line:90%
at least a 5 out of 10.

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
If you had no doubt, and you
know it's absolutely going

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to come true, change the date.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Make the date much
closer in time,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
because that will often
create a bit of discomfort.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Make it next month instead
of a year down the track.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:90%
How could that come true?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:84%
So let's just tap on
doubt for the moment.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
You can repeat this
process by writing down

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
all of your little committee
ideas on your piece of paper

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and tap through those
after we're finished.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So we always start with
our set-up statement.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have this doubt
about my goal coming true,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have this doubt
that this could possibly

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
come true, especially in
the time frame I want,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though I've got
this significant doubt--

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
how could this possibly
come true for me--

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I accept myself anyway.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:10%
Up to the eyebrow point,
this doubt in my body;

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:10%
side of the eye, this
doubt in my mind;

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:40.840 align:middle line:10%
under the eye, this amount of
doubt I have; under the nose,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:10%
this doubt about my
goal; on the chin point,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:10%
this doubt about this coming
true; under the collarbone,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:10%
all of this doubt; under the
arm, this doubt that I have;

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:10%
top of the head, this
doubt about my goal.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a deep
breath, and just see

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:90%
how that feels for a moment.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It's always really good to
read the goal that you've

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
written down out loud to
yourself at this point

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and check, where's my level
of doubt as I read it out now.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
If you become aware of
any of those committee

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
little voices or any
of the one-liners,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.528 align:middle line:84%
we're writing those
down to the side.

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to check,
what's that number out of 10?

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Where's my doubt at the moment?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Has it increased?

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Have I really tuned in here, and
it was higher than I thought?

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Start from that point.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Or have I had a little bit
of a shift here out of 10?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it dropping a little bit?

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It means we're clearing
it out to allow

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.838 align:middle line:90%
this to come into your life.

00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back to the eyebrow
and do a little bit more

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
on doubt.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:10%
This doubt about my
goal coming true;

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:10%
side of the eye, maybe this
goal's too big; under the eye,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:10%
this doubt that I'm carrying
around; under the nose,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:10%
this doubt that's getting in the
road; on the chin, all of this

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:10%
doubt; under the
collarbone, this

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:10%
doubt about my goal coming
true; under the arm,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:10%
this doubt might sabotage me;
top of the head, all of this

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:10%
doubt.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And read your goal
out loud to yourself.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
See where it feels
at the moment.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:90%
What else is coming up?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there any other ideas
you want to write down?

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:84%
How's it feeling as far as doubt
level, but then maybe belief as

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:90%
well?

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
If you were to guess
your belief level,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
belief often increases
as doubt decreases.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So often, we can check in with
that level of belief as well.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%
So continue tapping on doubt.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
We say clear the
elephant out of the room.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's get rid of doubt
so it's potentially not

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:90%
there as something to sabotage.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same
time, anything else that

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
might be coming to mind,
any of the roadblocks

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
that might be there that might
just want to get in the road,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:90%
we can apply tapping to as well.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So good luck with the goals,
one of my most favorite ways

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
to actually use
tapping, and certainly

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to teach lots of people out
there to allow everything

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever wanted
to come into your life,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
we just have to clean the
space and make the path clear

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:90%
so it actually can get to you.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
