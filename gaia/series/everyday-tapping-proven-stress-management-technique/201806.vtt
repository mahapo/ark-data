00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:26.341 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the most common
ways tapping probably is used

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:10%
is for stress.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about what a
profound impact tapping can

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
actually have on the
stress hormone, cortisol,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and not only
things like DNA changes,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:90%
but certainly mood changes.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
We know stress is
prevalent worldwide,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
so not only in our well-being
studies in Australia,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:90%
but the US and the UK.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Consistently, what
shows up is people

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
have stress in lots of
areas and domains of life,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
financial stress being one
of the highest, followed

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:90%
by relationship stress.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
What's probably
even more concerning

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is teenage studies
that have actually

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
been done across the world
showing that teenagers are

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
becoming younger and expressing
really high percentages of how

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
much stress they're
coping with in their life,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and not, perhaps, the
typical things like,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
my parents want me to get
a good grade academically,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
but things like
social media stress

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and being available
24 hours a day.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
By being connected through
what we have perceived

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
as fabulous technology, it's
having such an impact on them

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that their cortisol levels are
indeed high 24 hours a day.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So to have a tool
that's self applied,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
such as tapping, for
something as simple as stress,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.715 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, any of that type
of thing, is fabulous.

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into it.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a tapping
session now on stress.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first thing we
would do is typically

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
think about, either currently
in your life at the moment,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:90%
do you have any stress?

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you
feel stressed about?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a different word
to describe that for you.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It could be a feeling
of worry or anxiousness.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
If there isn't
something currently,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
do you have something
recently in your life

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that you could ponder
and think about that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:90%
did cause you stress?

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So either way works,
in the present moment,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
or, indeed, thinking
back to that time.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Normally, what we would
do is ask you to tune in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can
feel it physically

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in your body.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
If you do, you can focus
on that as we tap as well.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, if you
don't, it's just a thought.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all right as well.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Before we start with
our set-up statement,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
we would always give
it a number out of 10.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So that subjective unit
of stress rating scale

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
allows us to work
out, is this shifting,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is this actually
having an improvement?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
0 represents, I'm completely
calm, I don't have any stress.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But 10 would represent,
this is the most distress

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I've ever felt in my life.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can guess
the number out

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:10%
of 10 thinking about
your current moment

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:10%
in life that causes you
stress or the previous one

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:10%
that you're thinking
about recently.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So how much stress did
you feel back then?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.555 align:middle line:84%
So giving that a
number out of 10

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.453 align:middle line:90%
and guessing that internally.

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course, then, we would start
with our set-up statement.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And feel free to
tap along with me.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I will use generic words.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But, really, tapping works best
with your specific description.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So if the word
"stressed" isn't quite

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
right to describe
how you feel, or even

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
a sensation in
your body, you are

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
absolutely free to
change that to what it is

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
that describes it best for you.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But let's go,
repeating after me.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel really
stressed about what

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
happened, I accept
this is how I felt.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though I still feel
stressed about what happened,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have this
stress in my mind and body

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.245 align:middle line:84%
about what happened,
I accept how I feel.

00:03:58.245 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's come
up to the eyebrow

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:10%
point there and just
say one or two words

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:10%
that best describe how you feel.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:90%
This stress about that time.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:90%
This stress about what happened.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.554 align:middle line:90%
My stress.

00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:10%
Under the nose.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:10%
This stress I still feel.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.365 align:middle line:10%
On the chin.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.165 align:middle line:10%
This stress.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:10%


00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Under the collarbone point.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:10%
This stressed feeling.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
My stressed feeling.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And top of the head.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:10%
This feeling of stress.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a deep breath
just for a moment.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
being quite mindful,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
the best way to test
that tapping is working

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
is to think about, what is
it that I was worried about?

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Where's my stress feeling now?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can give it a
number out of 10 now.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And it is a good opportunity
for me to remind you that,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
if, sometimes, when we
first guessed our number out

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of 10, after the first
round of tapping,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:90%
it appears to increase.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, people may
guess a 7 to begin with.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But then after one round or two
rounds of tapping, it's an 8,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
often, what that
will indicate is

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that was your true
rating in the beginning.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you kind of
undercut it a little bit.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So all it means is,
tapping's working.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:90%
You've actually tuned in.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Use that as your starting point.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:90%
So has it stayed the same?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Has it increased?

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Or has it decreased?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:90%
What number?

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Just guess a number out of 10.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel it in your body?

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Is anything different
happening there?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there any other word
other than "stress" that you

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.758 align:middle line:90%
could use to describe it.

00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Let's come back to
the eyebrow and do

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:10%
another round of tapping.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:10%
This stressed feeling
about what happened.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
My stressed feeling.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:10%
I felt really stressed.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Under the nose.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:10%
I felt sorry stressed.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:10%
On the chin.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:10%
This stressed
feeling in my body.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:10%
Under the collarbone.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:10%
This stressed feeling.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
This stress and overwhelm.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And top of the head.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:10%
This feeling of stress.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, take a deep breath.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Check in physically.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
If you were feeling it
anywhere in your body,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:84%
perhaps there was some level
of tension or tightness,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:90%
is there a difference there?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking about
a recent or current time,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel about it now?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything happening
at a cognitive level?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Are you thinking slightly
differently about that?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Is anything else coming to mind?

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
If you do find a different
feeling presents itself,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you're free to move to
that feeling instead.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, emotions are
stacked as layers within us.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we tap
on the first one,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
we become aware
of the second one.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK to start again
and tap on that next feeling.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.023 align:middle line:84%
So for example, someone
may feel stressed,

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
but then, after a couple
of rounds of tapping,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:90%
start to feel some anger.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
They would just
turn their attention

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to tapping on the anger
feeling instead, again,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
checking in with wherever
it is or whatever

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
it is that's causing that
feeling for you at the moment.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's do one more
round of tapping

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
where we start to give
our mind the idea that we

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
might be able to let this go.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So back to our eyebrow
point and tapping.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:90%
This stress that I had--

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:90%
side of the eye--

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:90%
it's decreasing now.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:90%
This stress that I had--

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
under the nose-- is
starting to dissipate.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:90%
On the chin point.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%
This stress that I had--

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
on the collarbone--
is going down.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:90%
This stress about that time--

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:90%
top of the head--

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:90%
is leaving me now.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And then let it go.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:90%
And just see how that feels now.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Give it a number out of 10.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, if you were
not down near a 0 or a 1,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
you would repeat this process.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You can see tapping doesn't
take very long, only

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
a minute or two per round.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And it is just about
acknowledging, where am I at,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
where's my body at,
what's happening?

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Any other feelings that
present themselves as you go,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
of course, can be
substituted for the words

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:90%
that you're saying.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
here is to be specific.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:90%
Use your exact words.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
Substitute those for
anything that I'm

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
saying so that you get the
full benefit of how that feels

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and know that, even
though an hour of tapping

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
shows a 43% reduction in
cortisol, 5 minutes of tapping,

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
just as a daily
habit, can have such

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
a profound and roll-on
effect that, of course,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.425 align:middle line:84%
your cortisol levels, and
your DNA, and your physiology

00:08:58.425 --> 00:08:59.225 align:middle line:90%
will be affected.

00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
We do like to suggest to
people that perhaps you tie

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
your tapping once a day to
something you already do.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And brushing teeth
always comes to mind.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So if brushing teeth every
day, morning or night,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
also becomes tapping
time, then you'll

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
get an extra five minutes of
tapping it in there every day

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that will, over time, have
a profound effect on lots

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and lots of different
areas in your life.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
So happy tapping, everybody.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Keep it going.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I hope those stress
levels keep declining.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:90%
