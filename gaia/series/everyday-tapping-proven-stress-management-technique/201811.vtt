00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.996 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.996 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:10%
>> So a common question that we
are asked is why do we appear

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.720 align:middle line:10%
to tap with the negative?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:10%
So when we use our
words in tapping,

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:10%
it appears as though we are
tapping with negative words.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
What we are actually
doing is saying the words

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.012 align:middle line:84%
that describe our
present moment,

00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
whether that's
happening right now,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.803 align:middle line:84%
or it was something we're
thinking about from a week ago

00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:49.045 align:middle line:90%
that's still bothering us.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
about it, we're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
actually stating
the truth, the truth

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening for us.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But this does seem
counterintuitive

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of self-help
movements and a lot

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of positive affirmations
that are out there,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that, often, what
we're trying to do

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is to try to think
more positively

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or reframe, or think more
different about something.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
That's difficult to
do sometimes when

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
we're still in that state of
having a negative emotion.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So what tapping
does, even though it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
appears to look like we're
stating the negative,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
just remember that you're being
really mindful and present

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
in actually acknowledging
what's happening for you.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the first time,
people that come to tapping

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:84%
will often find they've
never done that before.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
They're so used to trying
to change their mind or just

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
layer over the top some
positive affirmation.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But underneath what is
there is perhaps still

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
the distressed feeling
or even a belief

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
that matches, that
they're actually

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
used to soldiering through
and trying to just think more

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
positively, when tapping is
a tool that could actually

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:84%
clear that out for you and then
allow the positive to come in.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, people
do ask, does it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
matter what hand
I use when I tap?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Most people will tend to tap
with their dominant hand.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfectly OK.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
With children, we say,
use your waving hand.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%
So the hand that you wave with.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:90%
But no, it doesn't matter.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Can you tap with both hands?

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So you may well see, if you
were to do a Google of tapping,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes, people tap
with both hands, both sides

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of the face.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's
perfectly OK as well.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Does it speed up?

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes,
that question pops up.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
If I tap with both,
will it make it faster?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Not that we know of.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So the answer there really
is not that we know of.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do things like
cross-over tapping, as well.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can tap on
the opposite side.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Carrol Look who's an EFT
master in New York in the USA,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
teaches crossover tapping.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It often can help
those two hemispheres

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
with the message
or a pattern that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
might be lifelong that's
being held in the brain

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:90%
neurologically.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It can help weaken those
links if you actually

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
tap on the other side
of the face as well.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's a range of different
things you can actually tap.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:10%
So with children,
we tend not to need

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:10%
to say the set-up statement and
tap on the side of the hand.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:84%
As we have someone coming
to teenage years, of course,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
we would teach the full process.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But, really from the age
of 11, 10, and younger,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.472 align:middle line:90%
we can forget about doing that.

00:03:16.472 --> 00:03:18.222 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the
time, they come to you

00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
when tapping might
be appropriate,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
is they're in the
emotional state.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're either cranky,
or angry, or sad or worried.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So they're already in
touch with the feeling.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We use four points
only for children.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't tend to need
the eight points.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And it works much
faster for them.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We encourage them to
use both hands just

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
so both hands are occupied.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So they will tap at the
start of the eyebrow and just

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
say their worry
or whatever it is.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
So it could be, I feel angry.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The next point for
children is under the eyes.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:90%
So I feel angry.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The next point for children is
to do closed fist and Tarzan.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So on both collarbone
points, and they

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:90%
could alternate, so Tarzan.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And the next one is open
hands, hug yourself.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.718 align:middle line:84%
So we're still getting the
underarm point that adults use.

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:90%
But they're hugging themselves.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So start of the eyebrow, under
the eye, Tarzan, hug yourself.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
For young children,
the number out of 10,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that subjective units
of distress rating

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about, tends not
to make a lot of sense to them.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:90%
Older children understand that.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But they'll use their
hands to show you.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:90%
So how big is this worry?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.725 align:middle line:90%
It's this big.

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we
do each round, we

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.433 align:middle line:90%
might, how big is the worry now?

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:90%
It's this big.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, their worry
comes down to, there's no worry.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
by they get to that,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.027 align:middle line:84%
they're either
laughing, yawning,

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and skipping out the door.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my
work is done here.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We always encourage people
to obviously self apply it

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to do
it, you're finding

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
yourself kind of having
an increase in your stress

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You might be in a work
meeting or a situation

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.203 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps you don't
want to actively, openly tap

00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
because that will just draw
more attention to what's

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
happening, is, there are
discrete ways of tapping.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably really useful
for us to talk about these.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we do teach them,
if, in a public place, you do

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
want to calm yourself
down, but you don't really

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.702 align:middle line:90%
want to have people notice you.

00:05:09.702 --> 00:05:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
two different ways

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:90%
that you can actually do that.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So one is to actually what
we call touch and breathe

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
where, it is discrete, and
really, nobody actually

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
notices, that we still
activate the pressure

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
point by touching it, and
maybe with a couple of fingers.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But as we sort of rub
there, and most people

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
would be quite used to rubbing a
temple, if they had a headache,

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
is, as you, in your own mind,
touch, and rub, and take

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.323 align:middle line:84%
a breath, you
would just focus in

00:05:36.323 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
on what the distress was
that was happening for you.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:90%
And really, nobody notices.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually
even skip a point or two

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
or just sort of sit
with your hands.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's not an active tapping.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's activating
the point by touch.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So touch and breathe
and just thinking

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
inside your own mind
of what's happening

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:84%
will still actually
have that effect

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:90%
of reducing the distress.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.967 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not make you
that aware of what else

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is happening around you
at that moment if somebody

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:90%
spoke to you.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But, certainly if you're
a public transport,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
or in a public place
where you didn't really

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
want to be noticed, it's
absolutely the best way

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.843 align:middle line:84%
And we teach teenagers
to do that as well.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
The other way that we teach--
and it used to be part

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
of the original
recipe of tapping--

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is to actually teach
the fingernail points.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the original,
longer process of EFT,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
when it first originated,
there are pressure points

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%
on each side of the nail bed.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%
So on each side of the nail bed.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And anyone that is a
nail biter will actually

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
tell you that biting
their nails reduces

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
whatever anxiety
or distress they're

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.893 align:middle line:84%
in at the moment, which is why
they tend to bite their nails.

00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:10%
So here's the alternative to
nail biting, as well as being

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:10%
able to tap discreetly, is
to squeeze the nail beds

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:10%
on each side of the finger.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:90%
So you can use--

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and you can do this with
your hands in your lap.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.928 align:middle line:84%
Again, what you need to do
is keep the mind engaged,

00:06:52.928 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:90%
so whatever is happening.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.303 align:middle line:84%
So say, in the moment, you're
feeling a bit overwhelmed.

00:06:56.303 --> 00:06:59.667 align:middle line:84%
You would sit with your hands
in your lap and squeeze.

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:90%
And you can do both hands.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze each side
of the nail bed.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So those finger points
can be done in the lap

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and discretely out
in public places,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.368 align:middle line:84%
and so can touch, and
hold, and breathe.

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
As long as, again,
you keep your mind

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
active with what it is
that you're focusing on,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:90%
you'll get a reduction.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:90%
