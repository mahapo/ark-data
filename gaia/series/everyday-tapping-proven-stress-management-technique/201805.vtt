00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
>> So we now have in the EFT
tapping world over a decade,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:10%
even longer, of clinical
trials that have actually been

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:10%
published.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Now in the research terms,
a randomized clinical trial

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:90%
is the pinnacle of research.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of beyond
a case study or somebody

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%
giving their experience.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
scientific process

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
where people are randomly
allocated to a condition.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't get any choice,
it removes all that bias.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And often people involved in
the running of those research

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
trials are often
blind to knowing what

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
the outcomes are going to be.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:90%
So again, we minimize bias.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we have in the
EFT world, over 50

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
of those randomized
clinical trials that

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
exist across a range of
different conditions.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, there's
another 50 to 60 single case

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
studies, pre and post
studies and things like that.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, above that,
we even have something

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
called a meta analysis,
which we'll get into today.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But the science and the
research behind tapping,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
what it's actually
showing is we've

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
come well beyond
understanding how EFT works.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, learning
more about the impact

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it has not only at
an emotional level,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so people will tell
you they feel better

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
at the end of tapping,
but they actually,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
we now know through physiology
studies, have a different body.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So actually have
a different brain.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So the research
initially started

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:84%
very much in the post-traumatic
stress disorder area,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
because it is such an
area in the returning war

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
vets communities that there was
a lot of research done there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And that has continued.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:10%
But really what has
come out of that

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:10%
is the first DNA study of EFT,
where there were war vets who

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.898 align:middle line:10%
had returned from war that
was still meeting criteria

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:10%
for post-traumatic stress
disorder, which we know

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most debilitating
mental diseases, disorders

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:10%
that people can suffer from.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And certainly meeting
criteria means

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
you have a whole
range of symptoms.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So that could be everything
from depression and anxiety

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to hyper vigilance to
insomnia to certainly things

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
like drug and alcohol use
and abusiveness and anger.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So a range of things that
really impacts people's lives.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Now the very first study in
physiology of DNA with EFT

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:90%
actually was done in a war vet.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So it actually showed
that after 10 weeks, so

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
one hour in a week,
10 weeks of EFT,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
tapping on all those things,
the DNA in those war vets,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and their partners were
involved, was changed.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So there were six
genes responsible

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.987 align:middle line:84%
for the stress response
that were actually

00:02:56.987 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
presenting themselves
as what we call,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:90%
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Now those six genes, what
we called down regulated.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So when a gene stops
expressing itself,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:90%
we no longer have a symptom.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
That can obviously have
roll on effects and things

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
like improved immunity and
suppression of cancer cells

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So six months later, those
genes in those war vets

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
still had not started
to express themselves.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So we know that DNA
changes can actually

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:90%
occur and stay changed.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Another study looked
at a single hour

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
of tapping for stress
and things like that.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And just in one hour, 72 genes
changed their expression.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Now they were related to
things like immunity and cancer

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
suppression and things like
cortisol, the stress hormone.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now 72 genes changing
after one hour of tapping

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
tells us it's not just
a feel good technique

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that makes you feel
calmer at the end, which

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:90%
is a bonus anyway.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.875 align:middle line:84%
We physically have something
different, very different

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:90%
that's going on here.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.067 align:middle line:84%
So we've a range of different
studies that have actually

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
looked at not only things like
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.037 align:middle line:84%
but phobias, so some of
those psychological issues

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that people do suffer
from and again, can be

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:90%
really debilitating, phobias.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
We've had chronic pain
studies that have come out,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and we've done some of
those here in Australia,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
where a four-hour intensive
tapping session for people

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
with chronic pain showed an
absolute significant decrease,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
which statistically means
it's not due to chance.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Significant decrease
in the level of pain.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So the severity
and the intensity

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
of pain, that six
months later had not

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
represented itself to
any of those patients.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So to have EFT included
in chronic pain programs

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.975 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, we believe
is an absolute must,

00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
because of the
impact that it can

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
have not only on
things like pain,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
but depression and
anxiety and different mood

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
conditions that go with it.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So here in Australia, we
have done about 15 years

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
worth of research
now, particularly

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
in the area for obesity
and overweight adults

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:90%
of looking at weight loss.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So we were really curious to see
whether or not the daily foods

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that people do eat that
perhaps aren't great

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
for them, if we could
eliminate those with tapping,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
reduce the desire, would
that have a long term

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:90%
effect on their weight loss.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it does.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:10%
So whilst we might run
an eight-week treatment

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:10%
program for two hours a week
where we tap on food cravings,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:10%
and there is a video
that you can actually

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:10%
watch to actually work
through a food craving,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:10%
we found that the impact
of not having desire

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:10%
for any single food, of
course would last over time.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And we do have a
two-year follow-up

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
showing that people don't
actually have their food

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:90%
cravings return.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
What that looks like in your
life is within time, of course

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
not eating those foods, you
actually then lose weight.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You of course, can use tapping
for things like increasing

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
your motivation to exercise,
drinking more water,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things as well.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we have found
time and time again,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it is
a surprise to people,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is that whilst people will
come to clinical trials

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
or go and see a
practitioner to learn

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to use tapping for things like
weight loss or food cravings,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is they sometimes don't realize
it may not be about the food.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The food really for us, is
the pinnacle of the iceberg.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
That it really is just the
way that someone copes.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Now that food could
be substituted

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
for a different type
of addictive behavior.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
That could be a legal or
illegal drug or medication.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
like exercise.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be work
for some people.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But any type of addiction
that becomes obsessive

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or a self-soothing activity
as the only go-to thing

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have, of course,
can become problematic.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But what it really does
tell us, is that it really

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:90%
is just a symptom.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes tapping
can work remarkably fast.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that does often
find tapping videos online

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and taps along with them
might quite quickly feel

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
like tapping's not
working, because they

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
feel more distressed.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
What's actually happening,
is tapping is working.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
But of course, not
knowing that, sitting

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the screen when

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
you might be tapping about
bringing more wealth and more

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
money into your life,
but you suddenly

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
think of something
from your childhood,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
can be quite distressing
for somebody, and of course,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
shut the video down and walk
away with a really highly

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:90%
distressed state.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Just remember, it does actually
mean tapping's working,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually peeled
that layer off quite quickly.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So it does happen in the food
space and the weight area

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
That people will often
tap on a food craving

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and start to lose the
desire, but then suddenly,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere, have
a thought or a memory.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
from five years ago

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:84%
or it could be
from 35 years ago.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And often not knowing,
will dismiss that thought.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually
happening in tapping,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is as the amygdala, that stress
center of the brain which

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
sends out the craving,
starts to become quiet,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
it allows the hippocampus,
which is the next door neighbor

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
organ in the brain, which
is your memory center.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So as your amygdala quiets
down, the hippocampus

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:90%
is allowed to open up.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the reason
people get random thoughts

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and memories when
they start tapping

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:90%
and they start to calm down.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Now not knowing that, you'll
dismiss that thought and go,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I was tapping on my chocolate.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:90%
What's that got to do with it?

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.893 align:middle line:10%
And why am I thinking
of that teacher that's

00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:19.580 align:middle line:10%
humiliating me in front of
the class when I was five,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:10%
and dismiss it.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But what it actually is,
is your hippocampus saying,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that's what's linked to
your current food craving.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Now in tapping, we
do have processes

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond our basic
tapping on ourselves,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
where we can actually process
different memories that

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
are quite significant for people
through a certain process.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And they are best done in
the hands of somebody that's

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:90%
skilled and a practitioner.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Certainly we can arrange
that access for anybody.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways
that we can go back

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and process what is still stuck.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So what we have found
in 15 years of research

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in the food and weight
area, is there are sometimes

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:90%
traumas in the background.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now a trauma is a
personal definition

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
of when you felt
abandoned or isolated

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
or without a skill set,
that you couldn't cope.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So we do look at something
that's dramatic and unexpected

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.858 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
any skills to cope.

00:09:10.858 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you could have been 15 when
something like that happened,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:90%
but you could have been five.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
People have those
moments when they're 30.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever that
definition is for you.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.213 align:middle line:84%
But often, what it is that's
the symptom in the day-to-day,

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and that could be the soothing
of the food or the drinking

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of the alcohol or the taking
of the prescription medication.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That is the soother
to try and make

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that feeling go away
that doesn't make sense

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.420 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.123 align:middle line:84%
Traumas in the brain when
we're too young to cope

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:39.920 align:middle line:90%
are book-ended.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We talk about that they're
put into a capsule.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So I say there's a
bookend when it started

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:90%
and a bookend when it ended.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it becomes put
in this little memory pod

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that people bury in the
ground for future generations.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's in your mind.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And that capsule
stays protected.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain
doesn't have a way

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.278 align:middle line:84%
to process that at
whatever age you were.

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it does to cope.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's very clever when
you think about it.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:84%
What happens as we're adults
though, is lots of things

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
happen to us in life,
and sometimes something

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:84%
can trigger that
capsule to open up.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
thing is tapping.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you're tapping
for the first time alone

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're learning it at
home or through a video

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and inadvertently
and unconsciously

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that capsule starts
to open up, that

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is when people will start to
remember memories, and not

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
realize sometimes
that it's connected

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:90%
to the current symptom.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
things that are there.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Tapping to me, though, as a
fourth wave therapy approach,

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.135 align:middle line:84%
really is one of the fastest and
one of the safest when you work

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who actually
knows what they're doing

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and can support you through
that process, one of the fastest

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:84%
ways to actually process
this, and process it for good.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So the research
is fast spreading,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and it really has gone in
so many different areas.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a lot
here in Australia,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
but in America and the UK, it's
just been growing and growing.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that not only the DNA,
but cortisol has been measured,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and we've done
that here as well.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The original one hour of
tapping study on cortisol

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:90%
measured it through saliva.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's the easiest way
to measure cortisol.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And that original study had
a 24% reduction in cortisol

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in one hour of tapping,
which was fantastic.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
They compared that to reading
a magazine and relaxing,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and they only got
a 12% reduction.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And they also compared it to
a psychoeducation group that

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
learnt about the stress
and things like that.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:90%
They only got a 12% reduction.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the one hour, tapping
got double the reduction

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
in cortisol.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Now at Bond University, we
repeated that trial in 2019.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We replicated it
exactly to see if we

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
would get the same
outcomes, which

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.237 align:middle line:84%
is important in
the research world

00:11:41.237 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
to see that it's
due to the technique

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and not the people involved or
delivering the interventions.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So we did exactly
the same thing.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And our particular trial,
our reading group got worse.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They had an increase in
their cortisol of 2%.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.273 align:middle line:84%
So their cortisol levels
actually increased.

00:11:58.273 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps sitting around
reading a magazine when

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
you know you've got to go
and do other things actually

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't a relaxing
activity for everybody.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:10%
So they actually
got an increase.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Our group that did the
psychoeducation and learnt

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:84%
about stress and
what it did to them,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and maybe how to
think differently,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
had a 19 and 1/2% reduction,
so it's similar to the 14% that

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the original trial had
received, just one hour.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But our EFT tapping group had
a 43% reduction in cortisol

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
in one hour.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So we doubled the effect.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So five years down the track
with more understanding

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and more knowledge of what
we teach, one hour of tapping

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.133 align:middle line:84%
was able to result in a
43% reduction of cortisol.

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol, of
course, is linked

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to so many things, such
as inflammation and body

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
weight and pain and lots
of different conditions.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to actually
physiologically do something

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
about that is profound.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Now the end of the research,
evidence science sort of area,

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.235 align:middle line:84%
is something that's
called meta analysis.

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that
actually means, is

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
when there's enough studies in
one single area, say depression

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety or post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we're able to analyze all
of the data in one group.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
What that allows
us to do, is truly

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
see, is the outcomes
due to chance or are

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:84%
they Indeed, being
influenced by other things,

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
such as the facilitator,
who's warm and encouraging

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:90%
and listening to you?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Or the environment
that you're in

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:90%
is lovely, that type of thing.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Or the group support
that's around you.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So a meta analysis, when
you've got enough studies,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
allows that.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the meta analysis that
exists so far for EFT,

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
have actually been done
by independent people

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in the field, which
is even better.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're not people that
perhaps are EFT researchers,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:90%
but they're outside the field.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:90%
So again, bias is limited.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So the normal way that we look
at effect size and what effect

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that it has, is by giving
it a number at a 0.1.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:90%
So we go from 0 to a 0.1.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And normally, it's
a decimal point.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So a 0.2 effect size means
look, something is happening,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but really there's
probably things

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
there to explain it other
than the intervention.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So the effect size of 0.2,
close to 0.0, is quite small.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:84%
A medium effect size, 0.5,
sitting in the middle there,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
look, something's happening,
and probably some of the outcome

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is due to the intervention,
but some of it's probably not.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Now medication trials
typically have an effect size

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.383 align:middle line:84%
of about 0.05, 0.06,
meaning, yes, the outcomes

00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you're getting are
due to that, but they

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
may be due to other things
too, like the authority you've

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
given to the doctor, who's
prescribed that, or placebo

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:90%
effect even.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Anything up around 0.8,
0.9 is a large effect size,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and it really is saying the
outcomes you're seeing here

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
are actually due to the
intervention, whatever

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
that might be.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, there's not
much at all, 0.1, that

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
would be responsible for that.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Now let me swing back
to EFT and the meta

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:90%
analysis that have been done.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So the meta analysis for
depression and anxiety

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
have actually been
completed separately.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And these are over 15
odd trials that get

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.340 align:middle line:90%
investigated in one big hit.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So the effect size
for anxiety is 1.23.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.425 align:middle line:84%
Now what that means, is
a very large effect size.

00:15:12.425 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So normally when you
look to that number 0.1,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
but to have an effect
size over the 0.1

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
actually means
there is no way you

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
could argue anything other
than the tapping intervention

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:84%
has resulted in that lack of
diagnosis or lack of symptoms.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Depression has had over 15
studies looked at it as well.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And the effect size for
depression was about 1.27,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:90%
so it was even slightly higher.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.057 align:middle line:84%
We've run several depression
trials here of major depression

00:15:38.057 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
in Australia as well,
and had the same types

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
of outcomes, where people
don't meet diagnosis

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:90%
after their intervention.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Now the PTSD meta analysis
that has been done, the effect

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
size of all of those
studies, looking at again,

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
an absence of
diagnosis and symptoms,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and of course, improved
quality of life.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.680 align:middle line:90%
The effect size was 2.96.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's say that again.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
2.96.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Meaning normally we look at a
0.1, and that's really large,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and we have an
effect size here that

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
shows there is absolutely
nothing else that

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
could be responsible
for the outcomes we're

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.068 align:middle line:84%
seeing here, except for
the intervention itself.

00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
such a large area

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that's been investigated,
that we know that time

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and time again, not only
at DNA and cortisol levels,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
but of course, lack of
diagnosis down the track.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We've had another meta
analysis that's actually

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
looked at what we call,
dismantling or comparison

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
studies, where we have actually,
and the question sometimes

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind, is it actually
the tapping on the pressure

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
points that has anything here?

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it the words that we say?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that the deep breath that we
take at the end of every round?

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's responsible?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So lots of studies have
actually pulled apart,

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
if you like, those
different aspects.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's been about
six studies now, again,

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
run independently by
people outside the field.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Where perhaps one group
just learns the words,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:90%
but don't do any tapping.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.903 align:middle line:84%
Another group that just taps on
acupressure points, but perhaps

00:17:00.903 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:90%
doesn't say the words.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
Another group that perhaps does
diaphragmatic breathing as they

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.172 align:middle line:84%
walk through the statements,
but doesn't do any tapping.

00:17:08.172 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
what we call,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
sham tapping, where
Harvard University has

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
done the research to show
that all of the acupuncture

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
points that are used in
traditional acupuncture

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:90%
have been mapped in the body.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So we actually know
where they are.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
not everywhere.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
under part of your arm

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't have any
pressure points.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So the best dismantling
study that's been done

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
has been done with an open palm
there as a sham point, where

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
there are no active
pressure points there,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and there are none
on the palm either.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Now several of the
dismantling studies

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
did make the mistake of
using the finger points,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
because of course, we
have pressure points

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%
on each side of a fingernail.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So by tapping on a
traditional pressure point,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:84%
we've also activating
these ones on the fingers.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:10%
So to use these
ones on a sham point

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:10%
inadvertently
activate these ones.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes these things
need to be cleaned up

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.518 align:middle line:90%
as we go along.

00:18:00.518 --> 00:18:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
studies have actually

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.315 align:middle line:90%
been looked at in one big group.

00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
what they've found

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
is the active ingredient
in EFT is the tapping

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:90%
on a true accupoint.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when we're
in the state of a feeling

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and we can't quite think
of the word to say,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
just the act of tapping
while staying tuned in

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
will still have the
outcome that you are after.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't physically
have to say the word

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
if you're tuned in
with the distress

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
feeling in the body or
certainly a somatic sensation.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So it is actually the,
and it is important to tap

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
on the right pressure
points as we go along,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
so that you are
actually hitting it,

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
because that meta
analysis has Indeed

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
shown that it is an
active ingredient

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:90%
in the tapping process.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe we're
at a tipping point.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I have talked in the past
about tapping perhaps

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:90%
being part of a fourth wave.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth wave that's
coming through in psychotherapy

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
is very much coming back
to body-based approaches.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So somatic processing, EMDR,
the eye movement desensitization

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
reprocessing therapies,
those are all

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
represented in this fourth wave.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And EFT is firmly
in there as well,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
where we're actually
shifting out of,

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and the first three
waves included

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.322 align:middle line:84%
the basic psychodynamic,
so Sigmund Freud,

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
coming into the
behavioralists, where we looked

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:90%
at classical conditioning.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the third wave was our
cognitive behavioral therapies,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
which did include
mindfulness and hybrids,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
such as acceptance and
commitment therapy.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But really where
we've come is now,

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe, into a fourth
wave, with the research

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
behind these
body-based therapies,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
EFT included, is demonstrating
not only the speed

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
at which they can work, but the
long-term neurological changes

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.755 align:middle line:84%
that occur and seem
to stay permanent.

00:19:46.755 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course, what
most people are looking

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
for when they walk
through that door

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and want to have therapy
or a consultation,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
is they want to know how
to remove this problem

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and feel better
and feel happier.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So Harvard University
was one of the first.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And they did a
10-year study where

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
they looked at through MRI
imaging, where acupuncture

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
points were in the body.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So they were the first
to really document

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have all these
acupressure points all

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
over the body.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Now in Chinese medicine and
those schools of thought,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
we of course, talk about
things like meridians

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and the energy system that
runs through the body.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And originally, back
in the early days

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
of even EFT research,
there was an understanding

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps what we were
doing was energetically

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
affecting the body's
meridian system, which

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:84%
certainly has been around
for hundreds of years.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
What we now know though, with
the Harvard University study,

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
but also Korean researchers,
is they've actually

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
shown that this meridian
energetic system

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or what was once
thought of as that,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is actually now a
physical system.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
That there are imagery slides
showing that the meridian

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
system is smaller than
a capillary, which

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is our smallest vessel
known at this stage.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So these capillaries and
then an even smaller version

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
is actually a physical system.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So coupled with the
information that came out

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
of Harvard University,
we now believe

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that the tapping on these
pressure points of course,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
is not only impacting how
somebody feels emotionally,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
but also the body's
physiology system.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So certainly if we have studies
that show cortisol is reduced,

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
DNA changes occur after an hour,
if not 10 sessions of tapping,

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
we have things like heart rate
variability, blood pressure,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
all those types of
studies have actually all

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
been included with EFT,
we see all those changes.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
It starts to make a little bit
more sense that we are actually

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
having an impact here then on
the body's physical system.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We know through other
studies, MRI studies,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that when we actually stimulate
pressure points, whether it's

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
through true
acupuncture or tapping,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
the stress center in the brain,
the amygdala, which normally

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
lights up to send out that fight
or flight response when you're

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
feeling distressed or that
emotional response, actually

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:90%
becomes quieter.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
We know through other studies,
that doesn't necessarily

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But with lots of the body-based
ones and mindfulness meditation

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
included, the amygdala
does quieten down.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases,
long-term versions

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
of tapping or
meditation show that

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that material, that can
actually become smaller.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now the opposite
can happen as well.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.713 align:middle line:84%
That if we stay in a high stress
state for a very long period

00:22:25.713 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of time, the
amygdala can actually

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
grow bigger, which
means it doesn't take

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:90%
as much to set it off anymore.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So the EFT research
is showing not only

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:84%
does tapping on the pressure
points send that signal back,

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but that this is
lasting over time,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and what you may once
have got upset about,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
no longer affects you
when it happens again.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Which answers the question,
do I have to keep tapping.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So if I tap on my
phobia of a cockroach

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and I see a cockroach
in the future,

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.947 align:middle line:84%
will I have the same response
and have to tap again?

00:22:54.947 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And the answer tends to be no.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain has
actually changed its pathway.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we know through
the body-based areas

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
in somatic psychology
and things like that,

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that touch has always had a
comforting, soothing thing.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
We touch children,
we hug children.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We might intuitively as a
mom when we hold an infant,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:90%
rub up and down on their back.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:90%
And might be patting as well.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
We know through lots
of trauma research

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that all of those
types of activities

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
regulate the brain
as it's actually

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:90%
growing and developing.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there's
acupressure points

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
all down the spine.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Not only of babies and
humans, but of dogs

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and cats and horses.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So then we have a lot of equine
therapists that use EFT now,

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and vets who are actually
using EFT in waiting rooms

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and teaching there, which
is wonderful to see.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But what it shows again, is it's
not just the words that we say,

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
but of course, we're
mindful when we do EFT,

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's also the
somatic element.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the touch of
those pressure points

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that really is having
such an impact.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And that meta
analysis has actually

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:90%
shown it's an active ingredient.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
That physicalness, which is
why when it's self-applied,

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.812 align:middle line:84%
we're literally doing
our own self soothing.

00:24:08.812 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
no greater gift

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
than to have the
ability, when you're

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
in any emotional
distress, to know

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that you have something that
can actually calm that down.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:90%
