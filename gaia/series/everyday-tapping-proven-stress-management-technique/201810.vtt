00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.097 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most researched
areas in EFT, tapping,

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:10%
has been in the area
of food cravings.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:10%
So we have run a lot of
that here in Australia.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
What it has shown us is
that you can apply things

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
like tapping to food cravings,
to any type of thing that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
actually probably gives you
some sort of addictive response.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So whilst today we'll have
a look at food cravings,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you could actually use
this technique for anything

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps you
find hard to resist.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So that could be
alcohol included.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:90%
It could even be cigarettes.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
We have also done a cigarette
smoking trial here in Australia

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So all of these are published,
and everybody can actually

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
get access to them and read
what came out of those results.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.748 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I can tell
you that all of them work.

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll have a
look at a food craving,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but you can imagine
applying this to anything

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps you find hard
to resist, like I said.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So if it is perhaps that
wine at the end of the day,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps taking the
Panadol, that type of thing,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%
you could do anything.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
If you found that perhaps you
worked a little bit too much,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that maybe some people kind
of called you a workaholic,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
we could put that
in the category

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
as well because anything that's
sort of obsessive or drives us

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and we feel like we don't have
much intervention in that,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
or we find it really hard
to pull back, of course,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:90%
you could try tapping with that.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So today, let me talk to you
about how to actually apply

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.547 align:middle line:90%
to a standard food craving.

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time we
ask people to have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:90%
the food in front of them.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So if for whatever reason you
did want to do this in action

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
today, absolutely go and
get whatever the food is.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, that could be
a drink as well,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes people might
choose something like alcohol.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
If you did want to do
that type of thing,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
we would always recommend do
the video at the time of day

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that you would typically
have the strongest response.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So if for whatever reason, it
was first thing in the morning

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and you did want to actually
tap on a glass of wine,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
but that's not a time that
you typically drink it,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.598 align:middle line:84%
we would say delay the
video until that 5:00

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
when the cheese and biscuits
come out and perhaps

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:90%
the wine as well.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It's always best at
that exact time of day

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps that
craving is strongest.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you
how to use this today.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a packet of chocolate
biscuits with us here today.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
it is really good

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to have the food
in front of you.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:84%
What it does is allows us to
sort of go into an exposure

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
mode where we can really pay
attention to what's happening.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes for some people,
packaging is really important.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the sight of
packaging on a food

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is the very first
thing that they

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
become aware of that
gives them a response.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
If that was the reason and
that actually happened for you,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
the very first
thing I would say is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
tap on what the
packaging does to you.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes a bag of crisps,
unopened, but just the sight

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of it starts someone's
mouth salivating.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
We call all those
things aspects.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of emotion
or body sensation

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.443 align:middle line:84%
or feeling or a thought is an
aspect that makes something up.

00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, in a food
craving we have a lot of them.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's often the sight
of it, the smell of it,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
the taste of it, the feeling
in my body, in my mouth,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.817 align:middle line:84%
and we one by one systematically
work through those.

00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing to
do then is to actually

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
have the food in front of you.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So if I take one of
these chocolate biscuits

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
out and have it
with me here, what

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for
with a food craving

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
are obviously all the things
I really love about it.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So it is a little bit
different when we do

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:90%
tapping on this type of thing.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.203 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
about it, we're still

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:51.893 align:middle line:84%
being really honest about
exactly what's going on for us.

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just with a
food craving, you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
tend to be really in
love with the food.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to do
is take that 10 out of 10

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:90%
desire level down to a 0.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So it is different
in terms of we're

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:84%
tapping on what
we love about it.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's still
true to the tapping process

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
where we're being 100% honest
with exactly what's going on

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's lots of
aspects, like I mentioned,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:90%
with things that we tap on.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
with food cravings,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
think of them as
characteristics.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll be
about the smell.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to smell our food
craving-- and in this instance,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I could
smell what that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:84%
smells like-- what
I would be looking

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
for the descriptions,
the characteristics that

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
really stand out to
me, that appeal to me.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm going
to tap on to start with.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:84%
After we do smell,
we'll move onto taste.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So it is always really
good to actually smell

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:90%
what it is first.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.808 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a cup
of steaming coffee

00:04:44.808 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you
want to do, it'll

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
still be about the
smell to start with.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to smell this right
now, what's standing out to me

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
is sweet.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's a word that just
comes to mind, and chocolatey.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:90%
The smell to me is chocolatey.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So the smell then I
would rate out of 10.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:90%
So how strong is it for me?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And the chocolate
smell is quite strong

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
because if my smell
aspect is high,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
my desire is going to be high
to want to eat it as well.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So the smell here is probably
a 9 out of 10 for me.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.583 align:middle line:84%
So chocolatey and sweet,
they're the things

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
that are standing out.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, I can't
smell anything else,

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
but let's start with those.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.057 align:middle line:84%
So if you have your
own food that you're

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
working with at home, just go on
the main smell characteristics

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So let me put that down and
start with our side of the hand

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So even though this biscuit
smells so chocolatey and sweet,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Even though this smells
so chocolatey and sweet,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
it's a 9 out of 10, I
accept I feel this way.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Even though this chocolate
smell is sweet, it's so strong,

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I accept I feel this way.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And up to the start
of the eyebrow

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
here, this chocolate
smell, the side of the eye,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:90%
it's really strong.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:10%
Under the eye, this
chocolate smell,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:10%
under the nose,
this sweet smell,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:10%
on the chin, this
chocolate smell,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:10%
collarbone,
chocolatey sweetness.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:10%
Under the arm, this chocolate
smell, and top of the head,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:10%
this smell inside the Oreo.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:10%
Now take a deep breath.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.063 align:middle line:84%
And our aim here
is to keep checking

00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
with the food, which is what's
really handy if you have it

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Is to then, as we guess
that number out of 10,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
actually give it a
smell and see what might

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.723 align:middle line:90%
be happening at this point.

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that's
sort of standing out to me?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything different?

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will smell
something slightly different.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:84%
The sweet smell for me
has actually diminished

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:90%
or dropped off.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I am left with is
some sort of chocolatey scent,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:84%
but the sweetness to me
has actually shifted.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I might do is one
more round on the smell

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.675 align:middle line:90%
and then move into taste.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So if I guessed a
number at the moment,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:90%
it's probably about a 6.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'll come back to my
eyebrow point, and I'll say,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
the chocolate smell
is standing out.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Side of the eye, this
chocolate smell, under the eye,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.380 align:middle line:90%
the chocolate Oreo.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Under the nose, this
chocolate smell, chin point,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty strong still.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Collarbone, chocolate
smell, under the arm,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
this chocolate Oreo,
top of the head,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:90%
this chocolate Oreo smell.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Taking a deep breath at
this point, and, of course,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
checking in with the food
that you're working with.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So to smell now, I can still
smell the chocolate smell.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
for me at this moment

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
is anything enticing about
it isn't sort of there

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes smell
will elicit salivation.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And what people might
find is after a few rounds

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of tapping, I can
still smell it but it's

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:84%
almost distant from
them, so it's not

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.348 align:middle line:84%
creating any physiological
response, which seems to be

00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:90%
happening for me at the moment.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:90%
So check yours.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
If you need to do
a few more rounds,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:84%
if smell is quite a strong
aspect, then maybe a few more

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
rounds on that before you move
to the next stage is useful.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The next point, though, is if
smell has disappeared a bit,

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
it's changed, maybe
sometimes foods

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
start to smell a
bit more chemical.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
People start to recognize
different scents in there.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not as appealing as well--

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is to actually try and
taste it, so to actually

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
have a bite because sometimes
the action of eating something

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and the sensations in the mouth
and then the feelings that

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
go with it are different
to what smell did.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So the point here is to
have a bite of whatever food

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating and
tell me what happens.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So here I go.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:90%
What am I aware of?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first thing that
stood out to me was crunch.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So crunch for
something like this

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
quite a satisfying feeling.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It dissolved pretty
quickly after that for me

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and then almost became a bit
of a creaminess in there.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So that is my next two
things that I'm going

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:90%
to look at as characteristics.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So working through,
kind of going,

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
the crunch was
satisfying, and then there

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:84%
was a creaminess that sort
of came in afterwards.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So back to side of the
hand, brand new aspect.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:10%
Even though this Oreo is
crunchy and then it's creamy,

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:10%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Even though this Oreo is crunchy
and creamy, quite satisfying

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
in my mouth, I
accept how I feel.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Even though this Oreo is creamy
and crunchy and satisfying,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I accept how I feel.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:10%
Up to your eyebrow,
crunchy feeling,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:10%
side of the eye, in my
mouth, under the eye,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.915 align:middle line:10%
this crunchy feeling, under
the nose, creamy and crunchy.

00:10:35.915 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:10%


00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:10%
On the chin, this
creamy, crunchy Oreo.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:10%
Collarbone, this creamy,
crunchy chocolate.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.685 align:middle line:84%
Under the arm, this
chocolatey, creamy, crunchy.

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:10%
Top of the head, this
crunchy Oreo, so satisfying.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.922 align:middle line:10%
Take a deep breath.

00:11:01.922 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, it appears as
I was saying all

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
these wonderful positive
words at this point.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But what it's really
about is being honest.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Tapping is all about
the truth, what

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:90%
is happening for you right now.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is about.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.913 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to remember.

00:11:15.913 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment, my next step
is to actually have a bite,

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and actually not feeling very
into my Oreo at the moment.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, like the smell
is disappearing a little bit.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I almost have to put
it closer to my nose

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to get it to have a smell.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I go with it and
try and have another bite,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll see how my crunchy
creamy is going.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's no
creamy anymore.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So even though there
is a filling in it,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.208 align:middle line:84%
the initial bite sort of
dissolved into a creamy for me.

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of not there.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit gritty now.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm becoming aware of
is something different in there.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
It's actually tasting to
me a little bit sweet.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So after a couple of
rounds of tapping,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I haven't tapped on
sweetness, but it's

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
starting to kind of have
that effect now where

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not pleasant, which
is where I want to go.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the
point where I'm like,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually want
to eat this anymore.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.937 align:middle line:84%
So let's do another round
of tapping just so that we

00:12:15.937 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
can get this to shift again.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:10%
So back to our eyebrow point,
the crunchiness is still there.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Side of the eye,
creaminess is gone.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye, crunchiness
is still there.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Under the nose,
creaminess is gone.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Chin point, it's
a bit too sweet.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:10%
Collarbone, the
crunchiness is a bit sweet.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Under the arm, this
crunchy sweetness.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:10%
Top of the head, I
can still taste it.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit sweet now.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
and let that go.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we get to
a point sometimes when

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we're doing food cravings
but we don't actually

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
feel like we want to
have another taste of it.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you do find
you get to that point

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
where it's not enticing you
enough, that's perfectly OK.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:90%
That is where we want to get to.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to give it a rating
out of 10 as to my desire level

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to want to eat this at the
moment, it's about a 1.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So whilst there is
nothing to stop me,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:84%
no free choice has
been taken away here,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
the desire, if I'm honest
with myself, is not there.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like you could take it or
leave it, that type of thing.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is where the
ultimate power comes from when

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
we do tapping with food issues.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:10%
So if something doesn't
have power over you anymore,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:10%
then, of course, it
doesn't bother you,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:10%
and you're free to walk
away or have choice and only

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:10%
have it once a month, or however
frequent you would like it.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to
taste it at the moment.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I have reached that
point where I'm like,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually want
to eat it anymore.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I almost have to put it up
my nose to get the smell now.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Something has shifted
there with it.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't anything in me
that wants to actually continue

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%
with that, which is good.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
If for whatever
reason there was,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:84%
you would continue working
through the different

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:90%
characteristics or the aspects.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't really talk
about any feeling or sensation

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:90%
in my mouth or my body.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.188 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes foods do give us
that relaxation feeling.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if that was
prominent with whatever food

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
you're working on, absolutely
tap on that feeling.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that we do know can

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
happen with food
in particular is,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:84%
as you're tapping away
on all these nice little

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
characteristics and getting
them down in their number,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
is you may well become
aware of a memory.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
You may well have something
that comes into your mind,

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and that is that memory
center letting you

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
know that perhaps there's
something else linked to this.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
We do know that anything
like a food craving--

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, medications,
illegal drugs--

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
if any of them are used as
a self-soothing in order

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
to make another feeling
go away, then there

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
may well be origins back in
earlier years, even childhood,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.437 align:middle line:84%
that need to be addressed and
tapping can be used for that.

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So keep that in the
back of your mind,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that if you did become
aware of anything

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to just
pop into your mind

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
as a past event or a memory,
that that is something

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
you can explore with tapping
and perhaps even with somebody

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.782 align:middle line:90%
that's highly skilled.

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's one more
step that we always

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
do with the food cravings.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:10%
Some of our original
research looked

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:10%
at food diaries of
everybody in our trial,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:10%
so we were actually
asking them daily

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:10%
to fill out what foods
they were eating,

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:10%
was it a craving, was it
for a different reason.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we coded
all of the reasons

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that they actually
were eating everything

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, which was
fantastic to actually look

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.820 align:middle line:90%
at as really rich data.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:10%
But what it showed us was there
were only three main reasons

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:10%
people would eat a food,
any food, in their lives.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It was mainly women that
filled out our food diaries

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
for this particular-- and most
of them were in the age group

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
50 to 65 years of age, so they
were the women in our trials.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And the number one reason that
they were eating was wastage.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
What that meant was they
were eating the food

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:90%
to not waste it.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We also realized that at this
point, that age generation

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:90%
of women in our trials--

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and we've since replicated
it with other trials--

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
have come out of having
mothers and grandmothers that

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
were in the Depression in the
1920s and the Second World War,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
where food and scarcity
was a real issue.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But those messages
have been passed down

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:90%
through generations.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And even in a world now that is
abundant with food and choice,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
the messages in a lot of women
in our trials in particular

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
have been around,
I can't waste food.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.753 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:16:41.753 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
We get to the point
where somebody

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
has an Oreo, a
bucket of ice cream,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.275 align:middle line:84%
a chocolate,
whatever it might be,

00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and they sit there
and tell us, I

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
don't have any desire
for this anymore.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
We then ask them, OK, so
you don't want to eat it.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It is junk food.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what we all tap on.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Can you throw it in the bin?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.356 align:middle line:84%
And most of the people
will say [GASP],,

00:17:06.356 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and they want to then kill
us for suggesting the idea.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've introduced this idea
into all food craving tapping,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:90%
but there's a second layer.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If you quite freely
can go, yeah, well,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want
to eat any of these,

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
and I actually can throw
the whole packet in the bin

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's junk
anyway, if you're

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:90%
OK to do that, fantastic.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The best test is to walk to the
bin, the rubbish bin, slowly

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
with your food, and see what
feelings come up as you walk.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
If at any point during that
process of walking to the bin

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to throw out a complete packet
of biscuits anything comes up--

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
a thought about it's
bad choice food, ,

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:84%
a feeling the most
common one is guilt,

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel guilty throwing it
out, any belief or thought,

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I could give this
to somebody else.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
There are starving
children in Africa.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:90%
I could send it to them.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Anything that might come out of
families or anything like that,

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
stop and don't
throw the food out.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Come back and do
some tapping on that.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best test is
to walk slowly to the bin

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
with your food to see whether
you can discard it but feel OK.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:10%
At no point do we want
people to not feel OK.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
What we want you to
do is do tapping.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, tapping at this angle
might be just on I feel guilty.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a feeling.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:90%
It might be on something else.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
There could be messages
there from the family.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
this does relate

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
to what you've been taught, and
you can use that in your words.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's, for the sake of
just doing this and seeing

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.170 align:middle line:84%
it roll out, do one or two
rounds on the whole idea

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
about food wastage is bad so
that we can actually move this.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
What we've found is
somebody could have no food

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
craving for the
Oreo but override

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that to avoid the guilt
feeling with wasting food.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So they'll actually
override no desire in order

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
not to throw it out.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
our setup statement.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Even I can't possibly
throw this food out--

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that would be wasting
it, I would feel so bad--

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
I accept how I feel.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Even though I can't
possibly throw this out,

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.635 align:middle line:90%
I feel too guilty.

00:19:23.635 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I learnt this message.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Even though I can't
possibly throw this out,

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:90%
it makes me feel too bad.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Someone else could have it.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the message
I was taught.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I accept this is how I feel.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Up to the eyebrow
point, I feel bad.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Side of the eye, I feel
bad throwing this food out.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye, someone
taught me this.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Under the nose, I
don't want to feel bad.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
On the chin, it would
be better to eat it.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Collarbone, I feel guilty.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Under the arm, other
people are going without.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Top of the head, I
don't want to waste it.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath and just see
what is coming to mind for you.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
It might be about
those family sayings

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about
in one of the past videos,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes we're just taught
what was relevant at the time.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
If there was a family
saying, particularly the one

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.365 align:middle line:84%
about eating everything
on your plate

00:20:45.365 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
because they're
starving children

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the
world going without,

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
teaches us sometimes to
override our natural satiation

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
points of when we want
to stop eating in order

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:90%
to not feel bad or guilty.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
If any of those words have
more resonance for you,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones to stick
with in your tapping.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:84%
We absolutely
recommend that if you

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:84%
were to tap on
any food cravings,

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
this must be included in it.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
What we're noticing is
at a generational level,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:90%
this is not shifting.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The message about food wastage
is actually continuing through,

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:90%
when maybe it's not relevant.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I can promise you what happens,
when there's no desire for food

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:84%
anymore, you don't
tend to buy it.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So the food wastage
issue actually

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
doesn't become your reality
because you don't end up

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
buying the food when there's
no desire for you to have

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.422 align:middle line:90%
to waste it.

00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's just in the first
stage that you really

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:84%
do need to address it in
order for it to become

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
a non-issue because you will
find, within time, that when

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
you do your groceries, you
only buy what you need.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, your food choices
may change as part of that.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So enjoy tapping on
the food cravings.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty out there that
we could all do at any point.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget the
food wastage angle.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:90%
