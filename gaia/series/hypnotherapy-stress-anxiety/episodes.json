So, anxiety is often problem solving and worrying about something that might not even happen. Anxiety is a response in your body to make you alert, prepared and ready to act for your benefit. But sometimes it doesn’t work for your benefit as your anxious thoughts can overwhelm you making you feel out of control and fearful.  In our session we will teach you some breathing exercises to help you remain calm and in control and replace those feelings of anxiety with feelings of calmness.  We recommend that you listen to our session at least four times so you can really compound the positive messaging, override the old beliefs and help your mind create new neural pathways so you feel much more in control and less anxious.","teaser":"This Anxiety Release guided meditation & hypnotherapy session is aimed at people who might be feeing anxious, overwhelmed, out of control or fearful.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/4dcae7e7-4612-426d-a8e9-92ecd7612223/202895_HFSAA_s01e02_Anxiety_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/ebfb6986-3d3b-4d42-a328-adcac682c0be/202895_HFSAA_s01e02_Anxiety_16x9_clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/ebfb6986-3d3b-4d42-a328-adcac682c0be/202895_HFSAA_s01e02_Anxiety_16x9_clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/ebfb6986-3d3b-4d42-a328-adcac682c0be/202895_HFSAA_s01e02_Anxiety_16x9_clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":202876,"seriesTitle":"Hypnotherapy for Stress & Anxiety","seriesPath":"series/hypnotherapy-stress-anxiety","seriesVoteDownCount":36,"seriesVoteUpCount":340,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2021-02-15","episode":3,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/51413f34-84bf-4265-bce9-e8808d4ab6bd/202896_HFSAA_s01e03_Depression_hero-clean.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/depression-3","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":1,"title":"Depression","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":7,"voteUpCount":74,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":7,"seasonCount":1,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":1451,"mediaId":202870,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":202870,"isFree":false},"id":202896,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"This meditation & hypnotherapy session is aimed at people suffering from mild depression. \r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have listened to our introduction video at the start of this series to help understand how guided meditation and hypnotherapy works and all the benefits it can bring.
