00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm Sophie from the
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.910 align:middle line:10%
All of our audios are slightly
different to just meditation

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:10%
alone because we use powerful
therapeutic tools, including

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:10%
cognitive behavioral therapy,
neurolinguistic therapy,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.150 align:middle line:10%
visualization, and, of
course, hypnotherapy.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
combination that makes

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
our audio so powerful and
hugely effective at helping

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:84%
you to change any of those
unwanted beliefs, behaviors,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
old habits, or negative
thinking patterns.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.185 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation.

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the state that's
really familiar to you.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the stage of relaxation you
fall into just before you fall

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:90%
asleep and just as you wake up.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.577 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really natural
feeling, and it's very safe.

00:00:40.577 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
that relaxed state,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
you're in the theta
brainwave state,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
which allows us to talk
to your subconscious mind.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all your
beliefs, habits, memories live.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's hard to change
things on a conscious level

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
as those behaviors,
thoughts, and beliefs don't

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.177 align:middle line:90%
live in your conscious mind.

00:00:55.177 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They live in your
subconscious mind.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
hypnotherapy can really

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
help to change any of those
unwanted fears, phobias,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:10%
behaviors, negative thinking
patterns, or limiting beliefs,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:10%
by talking to the
subconscious mind

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:10%
to retrain, reframe,
and rewire your mind

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:10%
with new positive,
empowering suggestions.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
at least four times
so you can really

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
compound those
positive messages,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and override those old
beliefs, and help your mind

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.523 align:middle line:90%
to create new neural pathways.

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Soon, you'll see the changes
in the way you think and feel

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:90%
about an issue.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And we suggest you
follow your instincts

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:10%
and listen to the audios
as often or as little

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:10%
as you want to.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to the audios at
any time of the day or night,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but we suggest
you listen to them

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.557 align:middle line:84%
when you're not too
tired because if you

00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
fall asleep and don't
awaken when we ask you to,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.688 align:middle line:90%
you've gone into a deep sleep.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's when your
subconscious mind just

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:90%
isn't listening.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't remember a
word we said and you wake up

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
at the time we ask you to,
then that's absolutely fine.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind has
been listening all along.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And it will have taken in all
of that positive messaging.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So please make sure you
listen to our audios

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.175 align:middle line:84%
when you're free from
any interruptions.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And don't listen to them
when you're actively

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
doing something.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:84%
So, driving or
operating machinery.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
If there's an
emergency and you need

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to come out of hypnosis
before we awaken you,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely fine.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind
will alert until you easily

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
come out of hypnosis,
just like waking up

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:90%
from a nap or a deep sleep.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So for now, please
click on any audio

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
you want to listen
to in the series.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable
position where

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you can really relax and let
go, maybe on a bed or a chair.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then close
your eyes to begin.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:90%
