[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the "Worry
Less" hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.910 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.053 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.416 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:84%
For right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go and really enjoy

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
all those peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.005 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.345 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you, now,
to take in a deep breath.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.945 align:middle line:84%
And you're bare
foot as you walk.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush,
green grass underfoot.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you get
nearer, you can smell

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:90%
their beautiful, fragrant scent.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And now taking another
long, deep breath.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich fragrant scent,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.895 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has golden sand, like
a fine powder underfoot.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one after
the other, gentle, rhythmic

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with a warm sea air

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.045 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.025 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
you walk back up the beach,
and there's a lovely deck chair

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
waiting just for you on
the sand under an umbrella,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.735 align:middle line:84%
offering just the
right amount of shade.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat and
you relax deeply now.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath and take

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.025 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:18.135 align:middle line:84%
And you notice the sky, a clear,
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
with polished, ornate
banister running down

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep,
rich carpet that

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.975 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:10.975 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that,
the deeper down you go,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.961 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to one.

00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.649 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Nine, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Eight, more and
more relaxed now,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
sinking even further
into relaxation.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Seven, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Six.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Five, even further into your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Four, allowing
your mind and body

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to fully relax as you sink
further into deep relaxation.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Three, comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Two, almost at the bottom now.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Just one more step to go.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And one, going deeper
and deeper down now

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
the ordinary, everyday world

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
as you sit deeply into the
comfortable, relaxing state

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious mind

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:90%
still fully alert and aware.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, every
day and every way,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel
more in control,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
more confident and assured
that everything will work out

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.965 align:middle line:90%
just as it should.

00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
You no longer worry about
something that might or might

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:84%
not happen in the
future, instead

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
choosing to focus on
the present, day by day,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
controlling what you can
control in the moment,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.032 align:middle line:84%
thinking positively and
recognizing that you are not

00:12:44.032 --> 00:12:44.865 align:middle line:90%
your inner thoughts.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
These thoughts are
merely thinking

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
patterns that have been
repeated over and over again

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in your mind until they
formed a habit or belief.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So you learn to replace
those old, unwanted worries

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
with new, positive,
empowering ones.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The key to controlling
your inner thoughts

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is to watch and observe
them, recognizing that they

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
belong to a third person.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now, to give these
worrying thoughts a character,

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:90%
maybe a name or a personality.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you choose
to spend less time

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
with the negative
character and you

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
increase the time you spend
with the positive one.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
You value the advice they give,
their wise words of wisdom,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and the confidence they have
in you and your achievements.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you
name the characters

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're instantly drawn
to the more positive one that

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
builds you up and gives
you hope and strength,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
listening to their words and
spending more time with them,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
ultimately drawing you towards
more positive thinking,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
fueling your mind
with positivity,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.415 align:middle line:84%
rewiring those
thinking patterns.

00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And as the little worries
seem to just float away,

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
you start to build more
resilience for the bigger

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
worries and stress
that you may overcome,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:84%
for we all have some problems
in life, some obstacles

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:90%
and some challenges.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But the key is how
you handle them,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.745 align:middle line:84%
how you think about them,
how you bounce back and cope.

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You no longer choose to
dwell on the negative.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You focus on the positive.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
You're realistic, but you
focus on the positive.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You accept that the
worries are there,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
but you decide now not to give
them your attention either.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You redirect your focus
from your internal thoughts

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
to the world around you.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
You distract yourself to help
change your thinking patterns

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:84%
from a negative thought
to a positive one.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.525 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you call a friend,
watch your favorite TV program,

00:15:28.525 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
read a book, and you
give this distraction

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
your full attention,
immersing yourself

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:84%
in something that you
enjoy doing, stopping

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
any worries mid
track, immediately

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:84%
retraining those thinking
patterns to go away

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
from negativity, straight
on to positivity.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
You start to realize
how effective this is,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and you learn the act of
distraction more and more.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you are
resilient, strong, confident,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
calm, and relaxed, letting
any stress or anxiety or worry

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
just bounce off you as if
you have a protective shield

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of steel around you.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine, now,
a situation that may worry you.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:90%
See that situation now.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Hear it.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But now I'd like you to
imagine that a gold shield is

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:90%
all around your body.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The shield is protecting
you from worries.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Any worries that come
to you will simply

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
bounce off your
shield and float away.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can step outside
the shield at any time,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
walk in or out, but it's always
there, an invisible shield

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:90%
that only you know exists.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Only you can benefit
from this shield

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
as you start to feel
more calm and relaxed

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
and in control more
and more each day.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:90%
No more dwelling now.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
No more forecasting,
catastrophizing

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
about the future, focusing day
by day now, fueling your mind,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.810 align:middle line:84%
filling your mind
with positivity,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
retraining those
thinking patterns.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And with practice,
your mind will get out

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of the routine of dwelling
and focusing solely on worry.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:84%
You're now undoing
negative thinking patterns

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to think
in the present, calmly

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and with clarity, thinking
much more positively, now

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.085 align:middle line:84%
achieving what you
want to in life.

00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are firmly
embedded in your subconscious

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:84%
mind and grow stronger
and stronger day by day.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
They grow stronger by the
day, stronger by the hour,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.735 align:middle line:90%
and stronger by the minute.

00:18:32.735 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'll count
from one to five to awaken you.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you now all

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:90%
the wonderful new feelings.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:90%
