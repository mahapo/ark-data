00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-being.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
releasing stress Mindtalk

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
In a moment the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
aimed to help you reach

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:90%
will alert you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go, and really
enjoy the peaceful feelings

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and benefits that come with it.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate, manicured lawns.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's a cool breeze.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.015 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:01:57.015 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:90%
You're calm and relaxed here.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And you feel safe and secure.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.875 align:middle line:90%
And you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you get
nearer, you can smell

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.705 align:middle line:90%
their beautiful, fragrant scent.

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And now take in another
long, deep breath.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich fragrant scent,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale, gently now.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.145 align:middle line:84%
And you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And it has a golden sound,
like a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one after
the other, gentle, rhythmic

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently
shines down on you,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
with a warm sea air
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.955 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.695 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's warm and inviting.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you let your toes test
the water with every wave that

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:90%
rolls in and back out again.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
you walk back up the beach.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lovely deck
chair waiting just for you

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
on the sand under an
umbrella, offering

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.675 align:middle line:90%
just the right amount of shade.

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:90%
You take a seat.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And you relax deeply now.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You take a deep breath and take
in your beautiful surroundings

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:90%
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.265 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again.

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:24.085 align:middle line:84%
And you notice the sky, a clear
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
with polished, ornate
banister running down

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep,
rich carpet that

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.765 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.925 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.375 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
In a moment I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.935 align:middle line:84%
And I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you will become.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.902 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to 1.

00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:22.598 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.598 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:90%
10.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
8.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
More and more relaxed
now, sinking even further

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:90%
7.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Deeply comfortable, feeling
every muscle release

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.516 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:05.316 align:middle line:90%
6.

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
5.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Even further into your deep
state of relaxation now.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:90%
4.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your mind and body to
fully relax as you sink further

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.010 align:middle line:90%
into deep relaxation.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
3.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Almost at the bottom now.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Just one more step to go.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Going deeper and deeper
down into hypnosis.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
All the way down to that
deeper, healthier level of mind,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:90%
deeper than you've ever been.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the bottom
of the staircase letting

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
go of the banister, you let
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
that ordinary, everyday world

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
As you sit deeply into the
comfortable, relaxing state

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
mind still fully
alert and aware.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in this
deeply relaxed state,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to think
about the stress

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%
that you've been experiencing.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
you've been experiencing

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
a whole range of
conflicting emotions

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and this imbalance
in your life has

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:90%
been difficult to cope with.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But you've now decided it's
time to deal with these emotions

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and to create emotional calmness
and, perhaps, find a better

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:90%
way to manage stress levels.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Having made that decision, you
are already well on your way

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to achieving your
goal because you

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
know that there are much better
ways of experiencing life,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
ways that are far more
productive, far more

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to you.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You know that where
one person may

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
be able to handle a
situation perfectly well,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:84%
another person may encounter
that exact same situation

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and find it
incredibly stressful.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
As I'm sure you're
already aware,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
it all depends on
you and the thoughts

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that you allow to dwell in
your mind and the meaning

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:84%
you attribute to your
thoughts, your environment

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and your experiences.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts influence
the way that you feel.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
you feel determines

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:90%
how you perceive your world.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:90%
But you are not your thoughts.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And these are mainly
thinking patterns

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that have been repeated
over and over in your head

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to form
a belief or habit.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So you recognize that you can
now replace your thoughts,

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
control them

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
so you can cope with situations
in a much more stress-free way.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's because you really want
to enjoy your life to the full

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that you've decided now to only
entertain positive thoughts

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The negative ones
that have made you

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
feel angry, upset
or sad or anxious

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
are just not important
to you anymore.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And you've decided now is
the time to let them go.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
You no longer want them.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You no longer need them.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Your mind rejects any and all
unpleasant, negative thoughts.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you're
going to reframe

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
the way you think about those
old stressful situations.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that you can
soon change the way you feel.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like all living entities,
we're creatures of habit.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And this can be good, and
sometimes not so good,

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
depending on the habit that's
been allowed to develop.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions went through
a similar habitual pattern.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
At first there was
the event, which

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
created a stressful
thought in your mind.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And the thought, in turn,
created an emotion, which

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:90%
then resulted in a reaction.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And you've learned to repeat
that thinking pattern again

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
From now on, in any situation
that makes you feel stressed,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%
you now replace that thought.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
You replace it with one
that fulfills your needs,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:90%
your desires, your wants.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And you work towards your goals.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
You ensure you say something
positive to yourself

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
with energy and
meaning behind it,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
breaking those negative
thinking patterns,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
learning how to manage
the stress in life.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to have a
think about your main cause

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
of stress.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Have a think about what's
causing you the most

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
stress in your daily life.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It may be your workload,
your financial situation,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
perhaps an argument with
a family member or friend,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
or maybe an endless list of
things to do, remembering now

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that where one person manages
a situation perfectly well,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
another person feels an
overwhelming sense of stress.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
being one person

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
allows it to affect them.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And the other ensures
stress bounces off them.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you ensure
that stress bounces off you.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Your mind can do this.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's simply practice.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Switching negative thinking to
positive over and over again

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
will retrain your thinking
pattern to do that.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd like now to imagine
a stressful situation.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine something that's
caused you stress in the past.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:90%
So feel it.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Immerse yourself
in that situation,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you're
perfectly safe right now.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
visualizing, it I'd

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
like you to take
some deep breaths

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself relaxing
and calmly handling

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the situation, all
the time feeling

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
confident and in control.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You are thinking
positive thoughts

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you'll handle the
situation just as you want to.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:90%
You're rational and in control.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You allow yourself
time to decompress,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
time to allow your
mind to unwind, time

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that you
don't have to be perfect.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do everything
at once, preferring now

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to take one day at a time,
helping you to feel calm

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed each and every day.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to gather
up your stress, worries,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and anxieties from the
past and, one by one,

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:90%
place them in a wooden box.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to hold on
to those thoughts and concerns

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:84%
as there's no looking
back and dwelling now.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
See yourself placing that
wooden box into a fire.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Feel the heat.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.555 align:middle line:90%
See the glow of the fire.

00:19:57.555 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't get too
close, but you watch

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
as the box and all your
worries and stresses simply

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:84%
disintegrate, never
to be ignited again.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment now to watch
the box and all of your stress

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety disappear.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You have taken control back.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready
to embrace tomorrow

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
with a fresh, positive mind,
feeling calm and relaxed,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
taking each day one by one,
recognizing that stress

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:90%
no longer serves you.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Now whenever you need to
feel calm and relaxed,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
you immediately start deep
breathing long breaths

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
in and out to help
regulate your heartbeat.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
To help regulate your oxygen
levels and your hormones,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
you breathe in for
four, hold for four,

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:90%
and simply exhale for six.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So do it with me now.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:90%
In for 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Hold for 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:24.915 align:middle line:84%
And slowly out for
1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:21:24.915 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And over time, finding the
pace that's right for you

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.960 align:middle line:84%
but knowing that you can trust
in this breathing technique.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
In for four, hold for
four, and out for six.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what you once
saw as a stressful situation

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
you now see as a challenge
you can overcome as you now

00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
have the resilience you need
to get through this, taking

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
each day one at a time, feeling
more and more resilient,

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
having the ability now to bounce
back, to pick yourself up,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and succeed.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
As you believe in
yourself, you believe

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that you will tackle a new day
with new energy and optimism.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:90%
You're now striving in life.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.015 align:middle line:84%
You feel powerful,
confident, relaxed, and calm

00:22:34.015 --> 00:22:34.815 align:middle line:90%
and in control.

00:22:34.815 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't allow any
more negative thinking

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:84%
as you know this is
toxic to your behavior.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your thinking
is filled with positivity.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm in control.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to manage
this situation.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I am strong, feeling calm and
relaxed more and more each

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and every day.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And they'll become
more and more powerful

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from one up to five

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:90%
