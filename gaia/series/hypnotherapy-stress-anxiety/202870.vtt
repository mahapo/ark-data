00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-Being.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
Depression Mind Talk audio.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.158 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax and let go,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%
as comfortable as possible.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And listen to the
sound of my voice.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And you make the most of it.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.425 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.255 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:00.255 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And, again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.385 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
to normal, gentle
breaths in and out,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
returning to your normal,
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful,
tropical beach.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.189 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose, and mouth, and your brow.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
feel loose, and limp, and
comfortable as your shoulders

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
sink into the
frame of your body.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.825 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the
light from the sun

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
down your right arm
from the shoulders

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the
nerves, and bones,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you move the sun over

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
to your left arm and guide the
light from the sun down and up

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
your left arm, from the
top of your shoulders,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
tips of your fingers.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.475 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.081 align:middle line:84%
And relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:26.787 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.787 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy down

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
into your hips, and your
thighs, over to your right leg.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up and down
from the top of the hips

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
as the right leg relaxes

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:90%
and you let go.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg from the top of the hips

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now
totally and completely relaxed

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is thoroughly relaxed.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But you stay focused
on these words.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and gentle breeze
in the air making you feel

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
pleasantly relaxed and calm.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see trees,
and plants, and an array

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.815 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.745 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself, you're

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
going into a very special
place, a place where you're

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:84%
going to create some
positive, wonderful,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.865 align:middle line:90%
long-lasting changes.

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.855 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.385 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:54.385 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:20.005 align:middle line:84%
10, 9-- deeper
and deeper still--

00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
8, 7-- all the way down
to relaxation now--

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4-- drifting off
peacefully and easily--

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
3, 2-- all the way
down, deeply relaxed--

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and 1.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable,
padded chair,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.715 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine or to become aware

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:11.885 align:middle line:84%
of a black mass
inside your stomach.

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And this black mass is
the depression, which

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:90%
you've had for some time now.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm now going to give
you a way of removing

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
these feelings of
depression, a way that you

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
can use any time
you feel the need to

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
both now and in the future.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take in a
long, comfortable breath.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe in, I want
you to imagine drawing up

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:90%
some of this black depression.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Draw it up from your stomach.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe
outwards, I want

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
you to see, or
sense, or simply be

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.815 align:middle line:84%
aware of this blackness flowing
out into the air as you exhale.

00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
You can watch as it's engulfed
by the positive energy that's

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:90%
flowing around you.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The blackness that
you've just exhaled

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
has now turned into a positive
energy, as once again,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:84%
you take a deep,
comfortable, inward breath,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
drawing up more of that black
depressive mass from within,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and then breathing
it out once again

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to become part of the wonderful,
positive, universal energy

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.785 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine now
that the energy takes

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
a form of a healing white
light that shimmers, and glows,

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.351 align:middle line:84%
and sparkles, and
radiates around you.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You may notice now that even
after this very short time,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
how you're feeling
brighter, and happier,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps a little
lighter as though any

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
weights have been lifted
from your shoulders.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And once again, take in
a deep inward breath.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And breathe out
depression, the blackness

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:90%
exhaling as you breathe out.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's surrounded
by and overwhelmed by all

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:90%
the positive energy around you.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to continue drawing up

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
this blackness from within
and breathing it out

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as you exhale into the air
to become positive energy.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And do this a few times, as I'm
quiet now for a few moments.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:17:02.775 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to begin to imagine

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or to become aware of a
small ball of white light

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:90%
inside your stomach.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And this ball of light is
only the size of a golf ball.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's a healing white light.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And this healing white light
begins to glow brighter.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming slightly
warm and comfortable

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:90%
inside your body.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
notice it increasing

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to the size of a tennis ball.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Notice now how the light
seems to radiate outwards.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
As the healing warmth
begins to spread and radiate

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:84%
throughout your
body and your mind,

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
you begin to feel so
calm and peaceful.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.005 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.005 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful,
warm, healing light

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
now grows and spreads
throughout your entire body.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Feel the warmth and energy
flowing through you,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
filling you with feelings
of peace and calm.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.516 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And this healing
white light is now

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
reaching through every
fiber of your being,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.525 align:middle line:84%
radiating and soothing every
area in which it's needed.

00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're so relaxed
and comfortable now

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
as this healing, white
shimmering light spreads

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%
throughout your entire body.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel happy and able to
deal with any difficulty

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because you now know that
you can deal effectively

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
with anyone and everything,
whatever comes your way.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And you find that those
little things that in the past

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
would previously upset you, they
now just calm and relax you.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And as you continue to
feel the warmth and energy,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:84%
this healing, white light
begins to reduce in size,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.044 align:middle line:84%
reducing now back to
the size of a golf ball.

00:19:24.044 --> 00:19:26.726 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're continuing to
feel the positive effects

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
of this wonderful energy
and well-being within you

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
from this healing, white light.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And this healing, white
light is within you

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
always for whenever
you feel it's needed.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And any time in future should
you notice those old feelings

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
of depression
returning, all you need

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to do is begin to take some
slow, comfortable, deep breaths

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and begin to exhale
that black depression

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and watch as it transforms
into your own positive, healing

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
energy, that energy white
light that belongs to you

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and you alone.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
You can then call upon
your healing, white light

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to increase your energy
levels and restore

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
your feelings of peace and
well-being wherever you are,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're doing,
and whenever you wish to.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%
All aspects of yourself benefit
from your healing, white light.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
feel and continue

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to feel the calm
sense of inner peace

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that's developing within you.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And you start to realize
that in any situation,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
there are so many ways
to view the situation.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Instead of continually
convincing yourself

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
hopeless, you now

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
consider all the other
options available to you,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
helping you to think of a plan
B. You keep yourself busy,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
lifting up the phone to
hear friendly voices,

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
organizing things to
do and people to meet.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You no longer have any
desire to hide away,

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
ensuring that your new
positive mindset is always

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:90%
keeping you active and busy.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you cut down on your
internet and social media

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
allowance twofold, as
it may only serve you

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.405 align:middle line:90%
for now with limited means.

00:21:47.405 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And as your inner
critic quietens

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and a new positive, internal
dialogue is replaced,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
you start to remind
yourself more regularly

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of all the things
that you're good at,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
of all the things that
people love about you,

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
perhaps occasionally
writing down

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
all of your wonderful
attributes as you

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.155 align:middle line:84%
keep repeating them when that
toxic will of self-hating talk

00:22:17.155 --> 00:22:17.955 align:middle line:90%
begins.

00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
visualize yourself

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.915 align:middle line:90%
thinking of a happy memory.

00:22:24.915 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Picture the memory
in your mind now

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and then take yourself
back to this happy time

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and feel the emotions
that you felt that time.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment now to enjoy
and soak up this happy time.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
From now on, whenever you
feel any dark feeling starting

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
to overwhelm you, you think
back to your happy place

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and relive that
wonderful experience

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to quickly shift your
mood and get you back

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
into a positive,
happy place, breaking

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
those negative thinking patterns
and teaching new pathways

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.075 align:middle line:84%
within your mind to resolve back
to a positive thinking pattern.

00:23:21.075 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And soon your mind
will stop immediately

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
going into a deep, dark place
as you're training your mind

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to become happier, and calmer,
and much more positive.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.205 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:23:46.205 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you all

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
the wonderful, new feelings.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
So coming back now.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:90%
