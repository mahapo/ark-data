00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to "House
of Well-Being."

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the anxiety
release hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
that aim to help you reach

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.825 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you driving or operating

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.865 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
all those peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.695 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.515 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you'll make the most of it.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to take
a deep breath, filling

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:90%
your lungs as much as you can.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.775 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in
and out, returning

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.955 align:middle line:84%
to your normal gentle
breathing pace.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.715 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
on a boat, which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
are, as long as it feels good
to you and it's a beautiful day.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth, and your brow.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.970 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.322 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And do you direct the
light from the sun

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
down your right arm
from the shoulders

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Your right arm begins
to relax and let go,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of the right arm.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you move the sun over

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to your left arm and guide the
light from the sun down and up

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
your left arm from the top of
your shoulders all the way down

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy and down

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:84%
A light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up and down
from the top of the hips

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
as the right leg relaxes

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and you let go.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move a light

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg from the top of the hips

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
and your left leg relaxes,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
releasing tension,
letting go now completely.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now
totally and completely relaxed

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to notice
that the sun is setting, going

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
down now, deeper
and deeper down,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed, but you

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day, and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.295 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.255 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:26.255 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.735 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:41.735 --> 00:10:42.535 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with a beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.285 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long-lasting changes.

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.725 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.285 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge
feeling more and more

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
10, nine, deeper and
deeper still, eight, seven,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to relaxation now,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
six, five, and four, drifting
off peacefully and easily,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
three, two, all the way down,
deeply relaxed, and one.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat
ready to embrace

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You may be feeling particularly
anxious at the moment.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're having feelings
of being out of control

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:90%
or overwhelmed or fearful.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps events seem too
difficult to manage,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even too many
different things or too

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
many different
people to deal with.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that anxiety
is healthy and normal,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and it happens to all
of us some of the time.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is a
response in your body

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to make you alert, prepared,
and ready to act when it's

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:90%
necessary for your benefit.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But for now, you've
allowed your anxiety

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
to become too
alert, too fearful,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's now time to allow
your anxiety some time

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to refocus, review,
to do its job better,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
return to helping you, and we're
going to do that right now.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're conscious of the
gentle beating of your heart

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and the steady rhythm
of each breath,

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
breathing gently and
slowly, slowly and evenly.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to
realize that you're

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
in control of your
thoughts as your beliefs

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
are just thoughts that have
been thought out time and time

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been thinking
too much that you're not

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:84%
good enough, or you've been
worrying about something out

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:90%
of your control or a situation.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.335 align:middle line:84%
Fear or phobia has
been holding you back.

00:16:05.335 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We can simply replace those
old unwanted thoughts now

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
with new empowering
positive ones.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's time now to stop imagining
the worst is about to happen

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:90%
when good things await you.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
As we free ourselves
now of panic or anxiety

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
or whichever symptoms have
been generated in the past,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we replace them with
feelings of calmness,

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
feelings of confidence, control,
and optimism for the future.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And every time you discharge one
of those symptoms of anxiety,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
you will replace
them with a feeling

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of being calm,
relaxed, optimistic,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:90%
and confident for things ahead.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You know that anxiety and
fear are very different.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Fear is what you feel in the
moment, when you're watching

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:90%
a scary film, for example.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And fear makes a lot of sense.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But anxiety is about the
anticipation of an event.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is your brain asking
what if too many times

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and coming up with a lot
of answers it doesn't like.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know the future.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
That what-if may
not even happen.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So anxiety is often
problem-solving

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.225 align:middle line:90%
but without the solving part.

00:17:54.225 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you no
longer worry about things

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that may happen in the
future, things that might

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:90%
make you feel out of control.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And you learn to live much
more in the moment day

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:84%
by day as you take
each day at a time,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:90%
being present and mindful.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And you release the
tension of worrying

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
about things in the future
that you can't control.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
You take each day at a time.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
You remember that the body can't
feel two conflicting emotions

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you feel
yourself tensing,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
anxiety rising, all you
need to do is slow down.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in and breathe out
and allow your body to relax.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have your
breathing under control,

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
gentle breaths in and
out, your body and mind

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
will have no choice but to
slow down, to ground yourself.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Your thinking will slow.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Your heartbeat returns
to its normal pace.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Those feelings of
anxiety will be

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
replaced with calm and
stillness, gentle breaths

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
in and out again.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a breathing
technique now.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to breathe
in for four seconds,

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
hold for four seconds,
and breathe out for six.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Starting now, breathe in
for one, two, three, four.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Hold for one, two, three, four.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And release for one, two,
three, four, five, and six.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And you find a pace
that's right for you

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
but using that
technique to calm you,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to ground you when your
thoughts and your mind

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:90%
seem out of control.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.935 align:middle line:84%
In for four, hold for
four, and out for six.

00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you feel
anxious now, you simply

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
use that breathing
technique to flip the body

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:84%
from feeling anxious into a
state of calm and relaxation.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You feel yourself free, such
a relief, such a release,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
taking every day as it comes,
taking back control, feeling

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
more and more in control
each and every day.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You take a couple of
deep refreshing breaths

00:20:53.450 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in and out, perhaps imagining
breathing in calm, pure air,

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
remembering anxiety is simply
an old primitive response,

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:90%
which needs help to escape.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, you're
exhaling any feelings

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.355 align:middle line:90%
of anxiety, stress, and panic.

00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can relax your body
if ever those old feelings

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
of panic return breathing
deeply and calmly,

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
retraining your mind to slow
down instead of speed up,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
rewiring those
thinking patterns,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body
and mind to relax

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:90%
as you regain control now.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:84%
When you inhale in
this way, your breath

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
pushes deep into
abdomen, deep, deep down.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You take slow deep breaths
to regulate your breathing

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and slowly let it go.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
All at the same time,
telling yourself

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to feel calm and relaxed.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I am calm.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I am confident.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I am strong.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:90%
I am calm.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I am confident.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I am strong.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.345 align:middle line:84%
You immediately feel much
calmer and much more relaxed.

00:22:22.345 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
You realize now that you
are not your thoughts.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are
merely old habits,

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
beliefs that have been formed
as they've been repeated

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
in your mind again and again.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So you decide to think
new positive thoughts now,

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:84%
empowering thoughts,
confident thoughts that

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:84%
will equip you to stay calm and
relaxed throughout your day.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you think these
positive thoughts more often,

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
you slowly compound and
replace the old beliefs

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of feeling anxious to
feeling calm and relaxed,

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:84%
rewiring those
thinking patterns now.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you find yourself
thinking negatively,

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
you immediately replace I am
feeling calm and confident,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
thinking more
positively day by day.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Your mind commands,
and your body obeys.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell yourself
that you're calm and relaxed,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
you instantly
experience that calm

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
relaxed feeling in your
body, taking back control.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever feel any of
that old anxiety creeping up

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
on you, all you need to do
is those breathing exercises

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible,
reminding yourself

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:90%
you can regulate your breathing.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:90%
You can relax your whole body.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You can and you do,
immediately grounding yourself.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You remember to check
your body for tension,

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:90%
and you release it.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Check your shoulders and neck,
letting your shoulders droop

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.405 align:middle line:90%
and relax.

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You check your
jaw, and you allow

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
it to hang loosely,
your forehead becoming

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:90%
smooth and relaxed.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:84%
You check your abdomen, letting
each breath relax your stomach,

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and each deep breath relaxes
your stomach more and more

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
deeply.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You relax any part of your
body that feels the tension,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:90%
letting it go.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
You always remember
that you are in charge.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability, the
tools, and the knowledge

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.765 align:middle line:84%
to let go of all of that
old unnecessary anxiety.

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident,
calm, and relaxed.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you find yourself
feeling much calmer and much

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
more relaxed and so
much more confident

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
as those old anxieties begin to
diminish because you know now

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:90%
exactly how to deal with them.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And after a few times of
practicing these techniques,

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:84%
those old unwanted
responses will

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:84%
change as a new response
pattern sets in,

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
a pattern of coping,
taking control, and feeling

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
wonderfully relaxed and at ease.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they're
even changing now

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
as you listen to me for you
instinctively know that you can

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:90%
do this, you can take control.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You can be in charge of
your mind, your body,

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and your health.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to think of a
situation that would previously

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
have caused you to
feel anxious, that is

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
before you learned these
new coping strategies.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Picture yourself at a future
date in a similar situation.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself in the
situation, what you can hear,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:90%
see, and smell.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Notice that you're behaving
differently this time.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:90%
You're much more in control.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Your body is calm and relaxed.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're speaking
calmly and confidently.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Your anxiety is so faint
you can barely perceive it.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself now
coping brilliantly.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself taking that
long, slow, deep breath,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
filling your mind
with positivity,

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
telling yourself you
are calm and relaxed.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And notice how you
instantly respond

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in a positive, healthy way,
feeling wonderfully calm,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.155 align:middle line:90%
relaxed, and in control.

00:27:29.155 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know instinctively that
this works for you, that you

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
can feel good, you
can be relaxed,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
free from any unwanted
feelings, replacing

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
them easily and effortlessly
with calm and confident

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
feelings, and you're excited
now to put these new feelings

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
into practice.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.622 align:middle line:84%
embedded into your
subconscious mind,

00:28:05.622 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:90%
all the wonderful new feelings.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So one, two, three,
four, and five.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
