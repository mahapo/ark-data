00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.925 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
"Negative Thoughts Release Mind

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Talk Audio."

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that aim to cause

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.695 align:middle line:90%
a deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go, and enjoy
all those peaceful feelings

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take
in a very deep breath,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
slowly inhaling, filling
your lower and upper lungs

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done
that, I'd like you

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
once again to take in a deep
breath, filling your lungs.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, allow
that breath to slowly release,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:84%
as you exhale, gently
and powerfully.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal, your normal
breathing pace, gentle breaths

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
in and out, as you
normally would.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%
as I refer to it in turn.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.755 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.215 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you allow those
muscles to relax and release,

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
every nerve, every
fiber in your hands,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
your wrists and fingers,
arms, allow that tension

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to flow away now, to drain down,
allowing the muscles to rest

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and release,
lengthen and loosen.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.974 align:middle line:84%
aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of the
tension to fade away now,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
as you drift deeper into
relaxation, muscles loosening

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and lengthening as the
muscles relax and release now.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Legs feeling heavy as
you release completely.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower back muscles,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
loosening and lengthening,
as each muscle releases

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%
as you sink into relaxation.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles
in your neck and scalp,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
aware of the tension
here, and now

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
you can release that tension
as every muscle in this part

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
of your body becomes
more and more

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
relaxed so that you can
feel each and every muscle

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in your body now loose and limp,
as that comfortable heaviness

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:90%
continues now.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud, so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number 3, you can

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So 1, your entire
body completely

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
released now, every
muscle, every nerve,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and every fiber relaxed and
at ease, your entire body,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
feeling completely relaxed
and comfortably heavy now.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And 2, your head
feeling so heavy now.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and you feel safe and
secure, and you're

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
enjoying this state
of deep relaxation

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.355 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And you are now deeper
than you've ever

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
been, so deeply relaxed that
every word I utter to you

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're
deeply relaxed, you'll

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
notice that your
thoughts can slow down

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and your mind can continue
to slow down, too.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Just let the relaxation
of mind and body

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
continue for a short
while in their own way,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.045 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and relaxing.

00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this,
the more familiar

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
the comfort in all parts of
mind and body will become,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
your body and mind recognizing
that this calmness and comfort

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
has a positive effect not
only in your body and mind,

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
but on your emotions, too.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And the more you practice
listening to this audio,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:84%
the more you're learning
to release your mind

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and body and also emotions.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
You are in full control
of your emotions,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're now going to focus
on your negative thinking

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you no longer
allow negative emotions

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
to build or develop and
to restrict your ability

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.195 align:middle line:84%
for positive thoughts, feelings,
and general well-being.

00:09:58.195 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Just as your body relaxes, so
too can your negative feelings.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be difficult
or made complicated in any way

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the first steps towards
changing your negative thinking

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
patterns is
understanding exactly how

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:90%
you think right now.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you tend to view
yourself as a complete success

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or a complete failure
in every situation.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
If so, are you were engaging
in black and white thinking.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Other negative thinking patterns
include jumping to conclusions,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
catastrophizing, and
overgeneralization.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
category you fall into,

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
we're working today to change
those negative thinking

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
patterns once and for all.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You will now learn to
put things in perspective

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and to help resolve and solve
issues worries, concerns,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
life issues, and occasions.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So in this comfortable
and calm state,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
be aware that a
thought, any thought,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
is simply a tiny part of
what's going on in your mind.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts have to
share mental time and space

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
with many other thoughts,
and these thoughts

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.952 align:middle line:84%
are only as big as the energy
we put into developing them.

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:40.724 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you
recognize that you

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
are in full control
of your thoughts,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.126 align:middle line:84%
and you decide how big
the thought becomes.

00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You decide how much
emotional energy

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
you put into that thought,
and you now control the energy

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
it consumes from you and if
it overpowers your thinking

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
and behavior.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Unhelpful thinking patterns
differ in subtle ways,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
but they all involve distortions
of reality and irrational ways

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
of looking at
situations and people.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, you recognize
that your thinking has

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
been negative, and
you ready to become

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
much more rational, positive,
and calm in your thought

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you're now in control
of those thought processes,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
you're excited to change your
negative thinking patterns

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
into much more positive ones.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It can be easy to allow our
negative thoughts to almost run

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
away with us, to forecast
and catastrophize,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
leading to more worries
and anxieties clouding

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%
your rational thinking.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, you're going to
reduce those negative thoughts,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
diffuse them, and
learn to manage them

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
as simply as the way you control
the tensions in your body.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do this
by reprogramming your mind

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to reduce those
negative thoughts

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and focus on solving the
problem instead of dwelling

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:90%
on the negativity around you.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, when you
feel yourself dwelling

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
on negative thoughts, you're
going to immediately place

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
more energy into replacing
them with a positive thought

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:90%
or solving a problem.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you think I'm not

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
going to be very good
at doing something,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.110 align:middle line:84%
you immediately replace
that thought with,

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
my best, and I'm

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:90%
confident I will do really well.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, you
may choose to identify

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
your negative thoughts,
evaluate them for accuracy,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and then place all your
energy into solving the issue,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
again replacing your
thoughts with positive ones.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Although it may seem difficult
to switch your thinking

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:84%
at first, over time
and with practice,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
positive and rational thoughts
will come much more naturally.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You now replace old negative
thoughts with positive ones,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:84%
as your self-esteem,
confidence, and optimism

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.895 align:middle line:84%
grows, feeling in full control
of your thinking process.

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
think about a scenario

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that you find yourself
thinking negatively about.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Now concentrate on what could
be done to solve the issue

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
or replacing your mind
instantly with positivity.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You constantly change
your negative thoughts

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to positive ones
and teach your mind

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the habit
of thinking so negatively.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Instead, remember,
you constantly allow

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
new positive thoughts
to fill your mind.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
You redirect your negative
thoughts, and by doing this,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
you're retraining your
thinking patterns.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And this process
feels more and more

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:49.610 align:middle line:84%
natural to each and every day,
replacing old negative thoughts

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
for positive ones as your
self-esteem confidence

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and optimism grows, feeling in
full control of your thinking

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to take in
a long, slow deep breath,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
inhaling calmness
and positivity.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale,
you allow yourself

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to breathe out and release any
of the issues you're carrying.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Feel the negative energy
seeping out of you now.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.095 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to begin this
new positive way of thinking.

00:16:27.095 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
You feel calm and
at peace as you now

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
replace those old negative
thoughts for much more

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
positive ones, as your
self-esteem, confidence,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and optimism grows, feeling in
full control of your thinking

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're creating inner
calmness and comfort,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
and return to a peaceful mind,
a feeling of being unburdened,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
a welcome return to
positive thoughts,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.419 align:middle line:90%
feelings, and emotions.

00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And while this may take a little
while to feel familiar again,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
it will bring with it positive
thoughts and feelings,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
a growing realization
that you are

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
in control of your thoughts,
and the level of that control

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:84%
determines how much
energy you allow

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to be used in managing
issues in your life.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But from now on in,
you always remember

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
you have the control of your
mind, body, and emotion,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're determined
to fill your mind

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and body with positivity.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And it feels right
and it feels good.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And each time you
listen to this audio,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
you bring not only more calmness
and comfort to your mind, body,

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, but also more
control, a greater familiarity

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
of the new positive
thought patterns,

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of being unburdened,
of calmness and comfort

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
at the deepest level.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And you may notice that
your confidence and calmness

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
develops in many
areas of your life.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
You can relax much more quickly,
enjoying life and feeling

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:84%
stronger mind and
body and emotion.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
You're now on a journey
of gentle positive change,

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and you know deep down
at a deepest level

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that each and every
time you listen

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to this audio you can continue
this gentle process further,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
allowing your
internal energy to be

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
placed into positive solutions
and positive thinking patterns.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax
in this way, you

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
bring calm and
control to your mind,

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:84%
much more positivity, allowing
greater well-being in your mind

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and body, greater self-control,
greater confidence,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:90%
and increased self-esteem.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So coming back now,
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
eyes open when you're ready.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:90%
