00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Positive Thinking Mind Talk

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.630 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.450 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Do remember to listen
to this Mind Talk audio

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
several times to
get the most impact

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
from the hypnotherapy
session, and please

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
don't forget to rate how
you feel after each session.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
relax, and let go,
and really enjoy

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
these peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take
in a very deep breath,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
slowly inhaling, filling
your lower and upper lungs,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done that,
I'd like you, once again,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
to take a deep breath,
filling your lungs.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release as you
exhale gently and powerfully.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal, your
normal breathing pace--

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
gentle breaths in and out,
as you normally would.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.505 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:90%
as I refer to it in turn.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.735 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you allow those
muscles to relax and release,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
every nerve, every fiber
in your hands, your wrists,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and fingers, arms, allow that
tension to flow away now,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to drain down, allowing
the muscles to rest

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and release,
lengthen, and loosen.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of the tension
to fade away now as you

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:90%
drift deeper into relaxation.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Muscles are loosening
and lengthening

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
as the muscles relax
and release now--

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
legs feeling heavy as
you release completely.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower-back muscles,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back, and upper chest,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
loosening and lengthening,
as each muscle releases

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:52.010 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:84%
as you sink into relaxation, all
the little muscles in your neck

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and scalp, aware of
the tension here.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can
release that tension

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
as every muscle in
this part of your body

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more
relaxed so that you can feel

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
each and every muscle in
your body now loose and limp,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
as that comfortable
heaviness continues now.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.525 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:48.525 --> 00:06:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been--

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
so 1, your entire body
completely released now,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
every muscle, every nerve,
and every fiber relaxed

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and at ease, your entire body
feeling completely relaxed

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and comfortably heavy
now, and to your head,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:90%
feeling so heavy now.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and you feel safe and
secure, and you're

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
enjoying this state
of deep relaxation

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And you are now deeper than
you've ever been, so deeply

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that every
word I utter to you

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
You are now deeply relaxed,
and your subconscious mind

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is open and receptive
to the suggestions

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
you will be listening to during
this hypnotic experience.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
In the past, you may have found
yourself expecting the worst

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And notice how I
say, in the past.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
That's because that old
way of thinking no longer

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:90%
applies to you.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that you
are listening to me today

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
confirms that your outlook
is already changing,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and you are ready to accept
what is rightfully yours--

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.135 align:middle line:84%
a happy and positive
frame of mind.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
You have made up your mind
that from now on, your thoughts

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:90%
will mostly be positive ones.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You have made up your
mind, you have decided,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and that decision was
yours and yours alone.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:84%
You already know that
when things go wrong,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
we cannot change other
people unless, of course,

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:90%
they want to be changed.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And you also know
that what you can do,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
what you can and you will
do, is to change yourself

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
and your way of thinking.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And these changes are
already taking place

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.485 align:middle line:90%
at a much deeper level of mind.

00:10:25.485 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
That is your wonderful
subconscious mind,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
the part of you that governs
your thought processes

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and all automatic
actions and reactions

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that have developed as
part of your personality

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
since the moment you were born.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you
are aware of is

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that there will be times when
your positive thinking doesn't

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
seem to pay off,
for example, when

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
you approach a challenge
to do something

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
you are not skilled in.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
You won't suddenly become
a champion overnight.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
But-- and this is a very
important but because you are

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%
approaching these challenges--

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
those skills will
build up, and you

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
will find yourself able to do
so much more than you previously

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:90%
gave yourself credit for.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You will also find
your self-confidence

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and your sense of self-worth
is increasing day by day.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
No longer do little
setbacks etch away

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.685 align:middle line:90%
at your belief in yourself.

00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
For when you set
your mind to succeed,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
you find that more often
than not, you do succeed.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.580 align:middle line:84%
If you were formerly plagued
by worries and fears of things

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that were outside
your control, you

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
will find those worries
and fears fade away

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:90%
as your confidence flows in.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You are thinking
positive thoughts

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.475 align:middle line:90%
and expecting the best outcome.

00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You now do this
automatically and because you

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
expect good things to happen,
8 or 9 times out of 10,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
they do happen.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
In order to use your
positive thinking

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to its maximum capacity, we
are going to plan how to get

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:84%
This means evaluating your
life and identifying areas

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
where you would previously
have reacted in a negative way.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So here, in the
safety of hypnosis,

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to bring to
mind three situations that you

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
will be approaching
differently from now on.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
These should be situations
where, in the past,

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%
you have experienced yourself
anticipating the worst,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
when, in reality, the outcome
was much better than you

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:90%
originally thought it would be.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I will be quiet
for a moment or two

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
as you allow
yourself to do this.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.572 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.572 --> 00:13:35.057 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And I now would like you to
create a blank, white screen

00:13:51.305 --> 00:13:52.105 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:13:52.105 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you to project
each situation, one at a time,

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
onto the screen, starting
from the end, where you

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
found that it turned out well.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you found yourself

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
thinking negative thoughts
about something bad happening

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to someone else, but
it later turned out

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were
absolutely fine, I

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
would like you to project
the memory of you discovering

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that all was fine
and run it back

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
like a film in slow motion, back
to the negative thoughts you

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
had, back to the beginning
of the experience,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.595 align:middle line:84%
and those particular
worries about that person.

00:14:39.595 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you're at the
beginning to the time

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
when you first had
those negative thoughts,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
zoom into your mind

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
to the image of yourself
worrying needlessly.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that vision
of yourself worrying

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
appears on the screen, I want
you to immediately replace

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that image and any
negative thoughts that

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
were attached to it with
your new, positive image

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It says though the
positive thoughts are

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:90%
overwriting the negative ones.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The two opposites merge into one
strong, positive, happy image

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of yourself with these new,
confident positive thoughts.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:84%
After all, you know you
were worrying for nothing.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you've been
through the first situation

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious
brought up in your mind,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to very quickly
open and close your eyes once

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
again, and we'll
repeat the procedure

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.972 align:middle line:90%
with the next two situations.

00:15:52.972 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So again, here in the
safety of hypnosis,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to bring to
mind another situation that you

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
will be approaching
differently from now

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
on, a situation
where, in the past,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
you have experienced yourself
anticipating the worst.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And again, create a blank
white screen in your mind,

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and project the
situation, starting

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
from the end where you
found out that all was well,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to the
beginning to the time when you

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
first had negative thoughts,
and again, zoom into your mind

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to the image of yourself
worrying needlessly.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that vision
of yourself worrying

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
appears on the screen, I want
you to immediately replace

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that image and any
negative thoughts that

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
were attached to it with
your new positive image

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts, positive thoughts
overwriting the negative ones,

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
two opposites merging, and one
strong, positive, happy image

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:90%
of yourself appearing now.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
for the last time,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:84%
imagine another
scenario where you

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
were thinking negative
thoughts about something,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
but actually, all
was fine in the end.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Start from the end and work
backwards to the beginning.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.815 align:middle line:90%
See yourself up on the screen.

00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:84%
See that vision of yourself
worrying on the screen,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
and immediately replace it.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
See yourself a new,
positive image,

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
your new positive thoughts--

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts replaced
with positive, happy thoughts,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
a happy image of yourself,
confident and positive

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
thoughts.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You know that your old,
negative thoughts were a waste

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:90%
of your mental energy and time.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
You know you are
worrying for nothing.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you no longer
entertain negative thinking.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
You prefer to use
positive thoughts.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You no longer assume
the worst scenario

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:90%
is about to take place.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I would like you now to use
your creative imagination

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and imagine yourself
in an attic looking

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
through a very old
chest or trunk that

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
contains lots of your
previous negative thoughts

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You're lifting the
heavy wooden lid.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
into the chest, you

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
realize it's time
to declutter, time

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of that
old way of thinking

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
that was holding you back.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have a bin bag
ready to throw out

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.695 align:middle line:90%
all of those negative thoughts.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you may see those
thoughts as symbols,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, small, heavy,
black containers,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
amidst a host of positive,
brightly colored thought

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:90%
containers.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you might see them
for what they are--

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts that
you are about to eliminate

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
from your life and your mind.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Take them all out, and place
the black heavier containers

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
into the bin bag, ready to
be put out for collection

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
after this session.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
You can dust the nice, brightly
colored positive-thought

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.880 align:middle line:90%
containers now if you wish.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
These are the happy
and confident thoughts

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
you have experienced
in the past,

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's nice to keep them.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be quiet for a moment
or two as you empty the chest

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and place all of this negative
thoughts into the bag.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of those negative
thoughts are in a black bag.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Tie the top hands
into a firm knot,

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and look inside the
chest to make sure

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
all your brightly
colored ones are there.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And before you bring down
the lid of the chest,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
take one more peek
into the chest

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
because there is
something you didn't see.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
There, right at the
bottom of the chest,

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is a very dusty
ancient-looking book

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:90%
with your name on the cover.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Take it out, dust it
down, and open it up.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And inside, you'll
find affirmations

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
about things that
are relevant to you

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and your circumstances in life.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.508 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.508 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what these
are because they're

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
personal to you, but I
can guess at some of them,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sure I'll be right.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The book contains short phrases,
for example, I can do it,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
everything will turn
out right in the end,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm worth it, give me a problem
and I will find a solution.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:90%
And there are many, many more.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
about this book

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there's plenty
of room to add more as

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and when you meet them,
or whenever you wish.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:84%
This is your book, and the
affirmations in this book

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
represent the positive thoughts
that you now entertain.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself
actively thinking

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
these new, positive thoughts
in so many situations

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you always look
on the bright side of life.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You are a much happier
and more confident person.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And as this confidence spreads,
you feel absolutely wonderful,

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and good things start
happening to you because you

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
are better company and
so much more relaxed,

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and other people
want to be with you.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are firmly
embedded into your subconscious

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:84%
mind and grow stronger
and stronger day by day.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:84%
They grow stronger by the
day, stronger by the hour,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and stronger by the minute.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I will count
the numbers from one to five,

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and at the count of five,
you'll be wide awake, fully

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
alert and refreshed, and ready
to allow these suggestions

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to work for you.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, coming slowly back; 4,
eyelids beginning to flutter;

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and 5, eyes open, wide
awake, mind and body

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
returning to normal,
conscious awareness.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
