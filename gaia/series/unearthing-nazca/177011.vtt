00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle line:10%
Last year, Gaia documented
several humanoid mummies

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:10%
discovered in the
Nazca region of Peru.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.110 align:middle line:10%
DNA samples were extracted
from the body, feet, and hands

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:10%
of the mummy named Maria.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:10%
The DNA was tested to determine
if it matched any known DNA.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
The results are in.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%

an unidentified organism.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:10%

>> It will be difficult to
imagine how someone 1,000 years

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm Melissa Tittl, one
of the producers at Gaia

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:10%
who went down to Peru in 2017
to document the first discovery

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:10%
of several mummies.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:10%
For the past year, our team has
been reporting on these bodies,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:10%
and today we have some
results regarding Maria

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:10%
and another body named Wawita.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's recap what we have
discovered thus far.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We took samples from four
areas in the body, the fingers,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the toes, the lower region of
the pelvis, and under the arm.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:10%
The CAT scans and
X-rays revealed

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:10%
that Maria seemed
to have what looked

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:10%
like a complete human
skeletal composition.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:10%
Carbon dating we
commissioned suggested

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:10%
that she was somewhere
around 1,700 years old.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:10%
We also tested the white
powder that covered her body,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:10%
and this test revealed it
was diatomaceous earth.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
In the same area, a
baby named Wawita.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
The carbon dating suggested
this body was 670 years old

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
but looks similar.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:10%
With all of this
information, we decided

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
to get DNA tests to
get more clarity,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:10%
and after being denied by
various experts in universities

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:10%
in America, we sent the
samples to various labs

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:10%
in other countries, and the
experts of the Russian Academy

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:10%
of Sciences at St. Petersburg
University delivered

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:10%
the first results.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:10%
After many months of
waiting for DNA sequencing,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:10%
our report was
generated by the team

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:10%
and this is what it revealed
about Wawita and Maria.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:10%
>> The sequencing process
itself is run on a device called

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:10%
the Genome Sequencer.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:10%
In our case, we
use two sequences,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:10%
one for the primary
analysis, MiSeq sequencer,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:10%
and HiSeq sequencer for
comparative analysis

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.625 align:middle line:10%
of the genomic DNA.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
A great amount of data is
generated after sequencing.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:10%
This data is generated
in the machine.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:10%
After this data
has been generated,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:10%
they are transferred
to a computer,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:10%
and then our colleague,
Alexi, a bioinformatician,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:10%
used them to analyze the data.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we process the
deciphered sequence.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
We remove, in the first
place, various impurities,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and after that, we compare it
with an available sequence.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
He found out that there were
actually ancient samples

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and we could yield the
ancient DNA, and we have it.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:10%
The fact that this
ancient DNA has

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:10%
a lot of variations that are
alternative to the standard

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:10%
genome is quite interesting.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it tells
us that we actually

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
have unique and new data, so we
have not added anything to it.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:10%
>> When we were in process
of genetic analysis,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:10%
up to the very end it was
unclear would it be possible

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:10%
to make some conclusions or not.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:10%
So the most important
finding from our DNA analysis

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:10%
at the moment was that
in population analysis,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:10%
it was absolutely clear that
the DNA of both Maria and Wawita

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:10%
doesn't belong to any
of modern human DNA.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:10%
That's the most important.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Second important
component, that they

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:10%
belong to the same type
of humans or species.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:10%
It's second conclusion.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.475 align:middle line:10%
And third conclusion is
that they are not relatives.

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:10%
They are not mother
and daughter,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:10%
but they are different.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>> So what does
this mean exactly?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:10%
According to the
report, it suggests

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:10%
that out of the
DNA samples taken

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:10%
from several areas
of the body, they

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:10%
were able to get 25.6%
of Wawita, 23.8% of Maria

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:10%
to read as human-like DNA.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:10%
That 23%, 25% of
readable DNA, none of it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:10%
was matched to modern human DNA.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:10%
>> My name is William Brown
and my official position,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:10%
a research scientist
and biophysicist.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm trained, though,
in my academic career--

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:10%
10 years at the university--
in cellular molecular biology.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:10%
I've got a master's in applied
recombinant DNA technology

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:10%
from New York University.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I've done extensive
DNA analysis results

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
which have been published
in peer reviewed journals.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:10%
However, I'm only analyzing
or interpreting the data

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:10%
as presented in the report.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:10%
I would say that the beings from
which the samples were taken,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:10%
from which the DNA
was analyzed, are not

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:10%
of any known terrestrial origin.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:10%
They don't appear to match
any species on Earth.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:10%
I first saw the Nazca mummies--

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:10%
most likely it's fake,
that was what I thought.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:10%
Although that was my initial
reaction to seeing it,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:10%
when I saw CT scans,
imaging of the bone

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:10%
underneath by individuals
who are trained

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:10%
in this kind of
practice, this kind

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:10%
of study-- so of the
DNA that was isolated,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:10%
only 25% of the total
matched any known human gene.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:10%
This is pretty rigorous because
there's like the 1,000 Human

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:10%
Genome Project where they
have done whole genome

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:10%
sequencing of over
2,000 individuals

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:10%
from every continent
on Earth and compiled

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:10%
kind of like a average
human reference genome.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:10%
And so you take these sequences
isolated from the sample

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:10%
with this being and you
go and you compare them

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:10%
to that human
reference genome data.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:10%
That's astounding.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:10%
>> You may be curious like we
are as to why does this data

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:10%
seem so different than some
of the other data out there.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, as complex as DNA
is, the more complexity

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:10%
lies in the question asked
by the scientists doing

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:10%
the sequencing.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, once you figure
out your question,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
you spend months or
even years trying

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
to figure out that one answer.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the question
our team asked was,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
could this DNA match
any modern human DNA?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:10%
Our answer came out as, no.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:10%
In another lab they might
ask a different question

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:10%
of the similar sample.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:10%
All of these questions lead to
answers in the same direction.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:10%
We verify this approach with
a professor of biotechnology

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Harrisburg.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm Dr. Doug Taylor.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm a professor of biotechnology
here at Harrisburg University.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:10%
My background is I have a PhD
in biochemistry and molecular

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:10%
biology.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:10%
When you think about any
parameters associated with

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:10%
or methodologies
for sequencing DNA,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:10%
how is it different from
one place versus another?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I thought that there just
was a set DNA sequencing process

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:10%
across every country,
across every lab,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:10%
but you're saying
that's not the case.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.135 align:middle line:10%
If you could explain DNA
sequencing differences

00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:10%
in other countries.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Start with DNA
sequencing, it's a evolving.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the question
you're trying to ask?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
That'll determine how do
I go about isolating this,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
and it can vary from lab to
lab or country to country.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But also comes to
the next question

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
is, what am I trying to answer?

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And what specific
population of DNA

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:10%
am I trying to look
at where I think is

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:10%
going to give me that answer?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And that may
determine, OK, well,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I need to put in this
intermediate step which

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.192 align:middle line:84%
is going to enhance
that population of DNA,

00:08:15.192 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
which is going to make
it more likely I'm

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
going to get an answer.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> But how was this
report created?

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.215 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
what kind of process

00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:90%
did they use to analyze the DNA?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DNA extraction, no matter
what laboratory does it,

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:10%
is very similar.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:10%
You want to take the sample,
you want to crush it,

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:10%
you want to crush it into
as many small particles as

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:10%
possible so we have
all the DNA particles

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:10%
and cellular components
floating around

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:10%
in some type of solution.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:10%
You then isolate the DNA from
the rest of the solution,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:10%
so then you have
your purified DNA.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
At our laboratory at
Lakehead University,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
we take that DNA extract and we
focus on very small fragments

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
of DNA, whereas Next-Generation
Sequencing, what

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
was written in the report is
they target all different types

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
of DNA on a much larger
scale and then they

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
make some kind of comparison and
draw conclusions based on that.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The DNA extraction process
is similar to the one of modern

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:10%
people, but at the final stage,
we added a magnetic particle

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:10%
separation technique to the
standard method just to remove

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:10%
the contamination that
occurred during mummification.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:10%
We repeated the DNA
extraction seven times,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:10%
and every time we
improved the method

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and improved the
protection of this method

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:10%
against any contamination
that could be brought in,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:10%
even by a laboratory researcher.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:10%
At every stage, we believe
we got a much higher quality

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:10%
sample.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Next-Gen Sequencing is now
the Cadillac of how you do

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:10%
sequencing, where you're
sequencing not the entire

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:10%
genome or the entire chromosome
but fragments that are derived

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:10%
from it.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:10%
And that isn't so simple to do,
especially if you go back now

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:10%
and want to compare
it to a reference.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:10%
Unless my reference is
exactly like the person

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:10%
that I'm looking at, then
it may not match that well.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> But what about the
possibilities of contamination?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:10%
You are probably wondering
about the other 75%.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:10%
And according to the
report, the other 75%

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:10%
could be anything from
bacteria to unknown influences

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:10%
or any life forms we didn't
run tests against yet.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:10%
>> So we have some results now.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:10%
It's very exciting
for all of us,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:10%
but still it's not
the final result

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:10%
because of the
first question, how

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:10%
this DNA of Maria and
Wawita are related

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:10%
to ancient DNA of
Peruvian people.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
important question.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:10%
And at the moment, we were
unable to answer this question

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:10%
because we didn't
have a database

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Peruvian people.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:10%
And then, we'll make next
population analysis comparing

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:10%
the DNA of Wawita and Maria
with ancient DNA of Peruvians,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.637 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll see how they
match together or don't match.

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:10%


00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the reasons that
you might see only 25% is

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
because your hominid being that
you recovered is not related

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:10%
to humans at all or any
known terrestrial species.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
The other possibility
is that there

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
was, for instance, a high degree
of bacterial contamination

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:90%
during the processing.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:10%
This is not the fault
of the individuals doing

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:10%
the extraction of the
material, the individuals doing

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:10%
the isolation and amplification
and sequencing of the material.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Bacterial contamination
is a widespread problem

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:10%
and all Next-Generation
Sequencing technologies,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:10%
it's partly because
life is everywhere.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at the foundation
of life, this information code,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:10%
you get inputs from different
sources that you don't want.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Even in the
best circumstances,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:10%
when you start with ideal
situations where you had

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:10%
everything done perfectly--

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:10%
the DNA was isolated
fresh, you had

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:10%
the appropriate
protective agents

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:10%
to protect the DNA from
degradation-- you're still

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:10%
not going to get 100% match.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:10%
>> What does it
mean, contamination?

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:10%
It was ancient contamination
with ancient bacteria,

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:10%
so it was defined and taken out.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:10%
But they were excavated, people
brought them in their hands,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:10%
even in gloves, but
people were breathing,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:10%
people were carrying it around.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:10%
It would be strange would there
be no modern contamination.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:10%
Then, it would
have been strange.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:10%
So as we have it, it's normal.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.595 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:10%
>> The DNA results would not at
all support the idea that these

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:10%
were human remains
that were altered.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:10%
There's no support to
conclude that it's a hoax.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:10%
Individuals who are not
basing that off of data,

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:10%
they're basing that off of
their opinion and perspective.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, based on my
opinion and perspective,

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:10%
which I feel is
informed by the data,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:10%
I see strong
indications suggest it's

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:10%
an authentic anomalous
remains of unknown origin.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> What does this mean for
our ongoing investigation?

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Scientific data analysis
from this report

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:10%
shows us that the DNA
gathered from Maria and Wawita

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:10%
does not match any
modern human DNA.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:10%
As with most questions, it
reveals another question,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:10%
and we welcome
independent reporters

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:10%
to explore further as we are.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Will further testing
reveal a subspecies,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
DNA that is still unmatchable
to any species known?

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Or will it just bring
up more questions?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:10%
Our scientists have some final
thoughts on the current report

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:10%
and the ongoing investigation.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:10%
>> As a conclusion, I would
say that it took us practically

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:10%
a year to make this
whole analysis,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:10%
and it's not finished yet.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:10%
So we're still in the process,
but it is absolutely clear

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:10%
that we are facing with
a very exciting situation

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:10%
because all data
that we have tells us

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:10%
that it's not human-like.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a simple
mutation, but it's

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:10%
another type of human species.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:10%
We don't know whether it
was some line of humans

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:10%
with elongated
skulls who was living

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:10%
on the earth for
maybe millenniums.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure that it will open up
a new page of human history

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:10%
and a new page of
civilization history.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:10%
>> This report says to me
that the remains of the Nazca

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:10%
mummies are, at this
time, of unknown origin.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:10%
It's a wow.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:10%
It's extremely surprising.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my final thoughts
are this is an incredibly

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
interesting find and it really
needs to be looked into.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is kind
of an exciting time

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that different groups can
apply different expertise.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer these
individual groups anymore.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:90%
You have a global community.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We can bring everyone
together on the global scale

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and provide different
expertise in order

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to answer some of
these questions.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Is it human?

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, what does
it mean for humans as a race?

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.365 align:middle line:84%
>> In our next update, we
have samples in several labs

00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:90%
in several different countries.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We look at the
elemental analysis.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:10%
>> It is an ordinary set of
elements, except for cadmium.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:10%
We have found cadmium
chloride on the surface

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:10%
of these specimens.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Those elements may be created
only by a highly developed

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And what can we learn from
a closer look at bone density?

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It looks like some
cyst encapsulations.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
She was unhealthy and old.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:10%
Here we have the main sinus.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:10%
It is circular.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:10%
In humans, it is
more box-shaped.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Frankly speaking, I have
never seen such round sinuses

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
on any thermogram we
have ever looked at.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:23.019 align:middle line:90%
