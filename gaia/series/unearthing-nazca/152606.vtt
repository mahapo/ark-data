00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.060 align:middle line:84%
[NARRATOR] Early DNA
results from Wawita

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540 align:middle line:84%
have determined
that she is female.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And carbon dating
from the samples

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.290 align:middle line:84%
taken from Maria's finger,
matched the date of her body.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
First, the team examines
new evidence presented

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Konstantin Korotkov.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:10%
In our research with Maria's
body, we had several steps.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Our first step was to
prove that it's real,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that it's not plastic.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not paper.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's ancient.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:90%
So we did carbon dating.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we did
analysis of structural body

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:90%
from CAT scan and from X-ray.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was proven that
it's a real body.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:90%
But how was three fingers?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:90%
How was three toes?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is artificial.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is just
attached somehow.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I was able to get a
sample from a finger

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and from a toe of Maria.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And we made extra
analysis of these samples.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And what is important, it was
proven that the same material.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
It is same chemical composition.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:90%
It's same DNA.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have no doubts, now,
that three fingers, three toes,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:90%
it belongs to this body.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
From the first DNA
analysis, it was proven

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:90%
that it's not chimpanzee.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not a monkey.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
But it's human-like DNA.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
It was proven.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Because we know that
now we have three types

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:10%
of human-like creatures, it
is Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.290 align:middle line:10%
like ourself, and Denisovan.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:10%
With Denisovan men, they
had practically our skull,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:10%
our type of skull.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:90%
No big difference.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was proven that they
have different type of DNA.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
would define this

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
another type of human beings.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the next
level, they have

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
to make much more
detailed analysis and much

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:90%
more complicated analysis.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So they will create
a library of genes.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, they will be able to
compare this library of genes

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
with a database
of human subjects.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, we'll see whether
it is exactly human-like

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.682 align:middle line:90%
or it is a little bit different.

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
[NARRATOR] While
the team anxiously

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
awaits DNA sequencing,
they are encouraged

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
with further examination
of Maria's CAT scans.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
[DR. KOROTKOV] And what's
important from a CAT scan,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
it is clear that all
internal organs was intact.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible
to see the heart.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
see the stomach.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible to see
something left from the brain

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So it is clear that she had the
same type of internal organs

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:90%
that we do.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
[NARRATOR] Peruvian
radiologist, Dr. Raymundo Salas,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:84%
who has been involved
with the investigation

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning,
reviews some of the details

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
found in Maria's CAT scans.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:10%
We are scientifically proving
that this body is a real body

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:10%
that was once alive.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, here, we have
the teeth from the upper arch.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And here are the ones of
the lower arch, the skull

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:90%
with remains of brain mass.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
This part here, shows
the lungs at the side.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the heart with the
bronchus and the great vessels.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Lungs at both sides.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
This is still the heart, and
here are the four cavities

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and the bronchi
that are preserved

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
with the shape of the
respiratory system.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Now we are in the
abdominal cavity.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We have these images.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The lines are part
of the intestines

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and relate to the structures
that build the abdomen.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:90%
It is completely harmonious.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the team focuses

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
on three new bodies
that were discovered

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:90%
in the same location.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:10%
We have come to Peru one more
time because the discovery

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:10%
of new bodies.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Three bodies that are
called, the family,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
because it seems that there are
two adults and one younger one.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:90%
They are very, very similar.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Their face's are different.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The hair is a little
bit different.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But everything else, seems
to be absolutely the same.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
We can see the skin here.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like a reptile
skin, like snake skin.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
We can also see the fingers
with very long nails.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And other characteristics
like the bone

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
in front of the chest,
which is amazing.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
We will make new CAT
scans and X-rays,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and to find out
through the experts,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
the reality of this finding.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And if they can be
proved to be real,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:10%
then we will have now six
bodies of the same kind.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Enough evidence to
consider this case real.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.784 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:10%
This is a scan of one
of the little mummies.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:10%
Each of these small
specimens have been analyzed,

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:10%
and their bone density belongs
to that of a living being.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.580 align:middle line:10%
Its preservation is amazing.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:10%
Really surprising,
especially the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.600 align:middle line:10%
bone part of these
small creatures.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:10%
We see that the
base of the skull

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:10%
has its own characteristics.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:10%
As we can scientifically prove,
the skull of these creatures

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:10%
have a cranial cavity
similar to humans,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:10%
but they have some
strong differences.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:10%
These are the interior,
middle, and posterior fossa.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:10%
If we check these
little holes, we

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:10%
see that the nerves and blood
vessels go through here.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Look, the cranial vault
and part of the brain.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the base of the
skull of this specimen.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the neck
and the backbone.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
These are the collar bones
and the thoracic cavity.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the pelvis and part
of the arms at both sides.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Here, we have another image.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
We can see the soft tissues.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a big surprise
about these small creatures.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they have existed.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:90%
This is not a fake.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:10%
[NARRATOR] X-rays and CAT
scans of these little bodies

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:10%
have proven them to
be unique individuals

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:10%
with similar characteristics.

animators to simulate

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
how these small creatures
may have gotten around.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They have three fingers and toes
and a large cranial capacity,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:90%
but do not appear to be human.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
[JAIME] It proves that we have
two different kinds of beings.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
One that is human
size and very similar,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
except the head and
the hands and the feet.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other, which
is completely different

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and looks more like a
reptile than a human man.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have right
now, two different species.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
[NARRATOR] Coming up, will
DNA sequencing finally reveal

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
the nature of these mummies?

Plus, further study of
the elemental composition

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:10%
from the samples taken.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:90%
There are two or more features.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:90%
One feature, it is cadmium.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.915 align:middle line:90%
And second feature is strontium.

00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But how they get it,
that's the big question.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:90%
