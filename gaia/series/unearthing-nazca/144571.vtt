[NARRATOR] As the investigation
around this mummy continues,

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:08.008 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the team digs deeper
into scientific examination.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.384 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
We're actually
doing it right.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:12.179 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
We have a healthy degree
of distrust of everybody

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.805 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
that's going on around us.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And we know we have to
follow the scientific method

00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:20.229 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to the very bottom
of our investigation.

00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.903 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
We were soon joined by
Professor Korotkov

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.113 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
from St. Petersburg University.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:33.659 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And his expertise is in
bioenergy and forensics.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
And we have a very
important mission here in Peru.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.539 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
I came here because

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.086 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
it was a group of scientists,
professionals, and journalists.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:48.632 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
[JAY] When he brought it out
and pulled it out of the box,

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.802 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
it was a stunned
silence at first.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It was a prepared mummy.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:59.351 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The size of this humanoid
was 168 centimeters.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.812 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
So, it's practically my size.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:05.732 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So, it means that
this was a person

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:11.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
who was walking as we do,
who was able to move hands

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.658 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as we have, with long legs.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:18.078 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So the proportion of the body
was very similar to ours.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.166 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
The mummies are covered
completely in this white dust.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.626 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
But this is not just white dust.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:30.299 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
It is something that is
going to really dry the skin,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the skin will be able to
survive for so many years.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.721 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[DR. KOROTKOV] When I was
able to clean this dust,

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:40.559 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I see dark matter. Very dark.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[JAIME] I got really excited
when I realized that

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.651 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
under the white powder 
was skin, real flesh.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And I knew then that we
had an organic creature.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.573 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:59.619 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
It has a head, neck, rib cage,
pelvic girdle, and limbs.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.164 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Then, inside the limbs,

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:04.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
something that draws
our attention.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The presence of two bones
in the forearm,

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.547 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which would be the radius
and the ulna.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:15.427 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In the leg, it would be
the tibia and the fibula.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[DR. KOROTKOV] We were able 
to see all vertebra.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.646 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And we calculated, 
it was about 25 vertebrae.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Plus, we were able
to see ribs as well.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.943 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So it was a clear 
anatomical structure.

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.487 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.782 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
DNA will allow us to make
a biological correlation

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:41.453 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
of evolution toward 
what species it belongs to

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:45.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
or how much similarity 
it has with the human species.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.252 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
As we continued to do
the full sequencing of DNA,

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.046 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Professor Korotkov 
and his team

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.256 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
have some interesting
first results.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.802 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Our professionals-- 
and it was one of the top level

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.303 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
professionals in Russia--

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.473 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
geneticists from
genetic laboratory,

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they were able to extract DNA.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They confirmed that
this is female.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.606 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Because there was
only X strands.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And this female has
structure of the body,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
practically exactly as the
structure of our human body.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.867 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Professor Korotkov's original
DNA testing determined

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
it was a female.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And once the team discovered
that it was a female,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
they decided to give her a name,

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:27.958 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and they named her Maria.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.252 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:34.923 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
From the DNA samples of
the mummy now known as Maria,

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.844 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
we were able to identify
that this is a woman,

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.138 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as the Y chrome is missing.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.681 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:52.607 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
On tomograms, in the
posterior parts of the skull,

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.152 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
we saw something that was
less dense than the bone.

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It is most likely the dehydrated
remnants of the brain.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.455 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In the chest cavity,
we traced the contours

00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:09.416 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of the heart chambers and
main branches of the lungs.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
In the abdominal cavity,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we saw the contours
of the liver and spleen.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And in the pelvis,

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.971 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
were clearly visible the
contours of the intestines.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.477 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
During the DNA extraction,
Professor Korotkov and his team

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
discovered the presence of
something else in the sample.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
In the process of extracting,
they have to dilute it

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
from a very special liquid.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.989 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And they've told that this
liquid had a very strong smell.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:47.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The type of smell of some herbs.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.917 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So it tells us that in
the process of mummification,

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:58.048 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
this body was mummified with
a type of some herbal liquid.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.717 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[MELISSA] Archaeologists 
like Daniel Merino

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:05.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
relate this kind of herbal smell
or concoction to ancient Egypt.

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:08.183 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.144 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Egyptian mummies also had
this type of embalming process

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:28%
for bodies.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.359 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
What they were doing was trying
to avoid decomposition

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:20.445 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
of the body so they could enter
the afterlife more intact.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.701 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So, they looked for natural
methods like acrylic resin

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with pigmentation 
to be able to maintain the skin,

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:31.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
the organs, et cetera.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So, it is absolutely
clear that those mummies,

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
they were specially prepared.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It was not just
natural modification,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.842 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
it was special preparation.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:47.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And the pose where-- how they
were sitting like this, again,

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
it's one more indication
for all of us.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.727 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
[NARRATOR] Was this special
preparation created

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:54.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
by humans or non-humans?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.317 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Is it possible that this body
was mummified using practices

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.778 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
similar to ancient Egypt?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.906 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Coming up, a
musculoskeletal radiologist

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
notices something interesting.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:28%
The skull--

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.288 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
I don't see any suture lines.

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:14.583 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
There's no bones
that are separate in the skull.

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They all appear fused.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:19.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So, this appears 
to be a solid structure.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.089 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
[NARRATOR] The samples 
are in laboratories

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in five different countries,

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.927 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and full DNA sequencing
is in the process.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
While the team waits
for the results,

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
there are other bodies 
to investigate

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.183 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
from the same location.
