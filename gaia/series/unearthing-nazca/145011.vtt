00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:02.711 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[NARRATOR] A smaller body
has been discovered

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.379 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
this time 
without a head,

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
enabling a view into the body
that experts haven't had before.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A new confirmation of
carbon dating has come in.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.355 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
The first carbon
dating on Maria showed

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
it was from between
245 AD and 410 AD.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A second sample of Maria
was analyzed and came back

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
at virtually the same age, which
was between 249 AD and 411 AD.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
[JAIME] People have 
to understand

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
that these 
kind of bodies

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:45.629 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
have always been in the hands 
of governments and the military.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's the first time
we have this chance,

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.592 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and that's why we
have to take it.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
[NARRATOR] Smaller bodies were
also found at the same tomb

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
as Maria.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But the team was not
allowed to take samples.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.437 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Then they heard word that
another body would soon arrive.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
[JAIME] We will have one body.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.152 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And we will be able to
take samples from that body

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:12.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
because it's very
important to determine

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:18.245 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
how old these little bodies
are and how similar to humans

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.373 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
through the DNA analyses are.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I believe it's even
more important for me,

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:30.173 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I mean, some people think
that the big bodies have

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
more answers for us because
it looks more human.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.349 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
[NARRATOR] The team decide 
to give this body a name

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
without knowing the sex.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And they name it Victoria.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[MELISSA] So the one body 
has arrived.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And it does not have a head.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.402 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
The head was cut off, 
it looks like.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.321 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
This is what Jaime thinks, 
and Edson,

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.073 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
who is our surgeon, 
who is analyzing it right now.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
[NARRATOR] 
At the Inkari Institute,

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Thierry Jamin 
helps a team

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.872 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
set up for an inspection 
of the body.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.584 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
My name is Thierry Jamin.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.793 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I am an investigator.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:11.256 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
We do archaeological
investigations here in Peru.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[NARRATOR] Not only did Victoria
arrive without a head,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.637 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
but it was posed in
the sitting position,

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.848 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
unlike the other
small bodies found.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.186 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
[THIERRY] Why is there powder
in the center here?

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.982 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If it was cut recently,
why is there powder there?

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:35.072 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
No, but not if you realize
that these little fibers

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.491 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
would have powder, too.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.701 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
So there are two things.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The head had been 
superimposed over the joint,

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.707 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or only over those ligaments,

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and it had a function like this.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:51.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And to be able to take
the head completely off,

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they would have had to have cut
the little fibers,

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.386 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
because it seems to me that the
head wasn't completely

00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
attached to what would have
been the spinal column.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But yes, to the ligaments,
tendons, or the rest

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.602 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of the little fibers
that were able to be

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.022 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
inserted into the skull,
that's what it seems like

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.273 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
the most to me.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:18.698 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
If we look really closely,
here, they have exact cuts.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.783 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
You can see here.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:26.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We get to see inside 
of the skeleton of the creature.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.257 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
A lot of the white resin 
that's on the body

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.508 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
has been kind of wiped off.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.676 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
So you get to see the skin.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.636 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it looks kind of
like a lizard skin.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.138 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And we're going to
be taking samples

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in the next few minutes.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[DR. EDSON] 
Oh, look. Look.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.314 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Look at this cool
feature that it has here.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This is a really
important feature.

00:03:53.275 --> 00:03:55.026 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Do we have some tweezers?

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.615 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
No, no, no, no.
I don't want to cut it.

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
But I want you to see this here.

00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:05.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This here comes from the
little tubular fibers.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
And here is another.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It has a 
thick compact fiber,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.171 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
like a packet 
of vascular nerves.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.384 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They fulfill the
anatomical characteristics.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.431 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If this were a fraud
or were it put together,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.684 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
whoever did this definitely
had a very broad knowledge

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:28.685 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
of anatomy.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And at the same time, 
he must have been an artisan

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.357 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
with a unique skill or ability.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:38.528 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
To get this, for example,
these anatomical details

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:43.158 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that I can assess, 
these microfibers here,

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
what would apparently be tendons
or ligaments, you can see them.

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.208 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This right here is the little
fibers, and these two here.

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:53.126 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Here's one, 
and here's the other.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.754 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They're like arteries
or something like that.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This is definitely
an original being.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.812 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[NARRATOR] Once the team
dissected the small body,

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they began to take samples
from the neck and the hip.

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:19.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:26.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Aluminum foil is used to
collect any debris that

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:29.412 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
might fall off of the body
during the sample collecting.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:34.834 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I feel that after we have
actually gotten to dissect this

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
body, that the head not
been there was actually

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:41.591 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
kind of a blessing, because 
wegot to see the tendons

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and what looked like
to be arteries.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.555 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And we got to cut
into the hip bone

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:49.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and really see the
structure inside.

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:56.398 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
I'm completely surprised.

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.149 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I mean, I have to, 
as a journalist, always

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.987 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
be skeptical of what I'm
doing and what we're seeing.

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:06.283 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But I am thoroughly
surprised at what we've

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:08.159 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
gathered for our samples today.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.579 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And I'm very eager to
find out DNA testing--

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
what it is that we gathered.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I mean, clearly, the doctor
thinks that they're arteries

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.002 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and that they are
tendons, especially

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:19.838 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the neck that connected
the head at one point.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And there was a couple in
the hip, which we also took.

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:28.263 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I think all of us here, doctor,
the archaeologist, and Thierry,

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and our crew are
completely surprised.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.225 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So we'll have to
see what happens.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We've just taken the
samples from the bodies.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.942 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
As you can see, the samples
have been marked and documented

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:41.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
from where they came from.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
They're also sealed,
which we're not

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
going to touch them
until they go to the lab.

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:48.742 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And the lab will open them.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[NARRATOR] The samples have been
sent to labs in five different

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:54.456 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
countries for Carbon-14 dating
and DNA tests.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.207 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
It's called a tomogram.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:07:00.378 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Basically, it's a
full-body X-ray of sorts--

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
so, not as detailed as the CT is
in the components of the bone.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But it does give us
a general idea

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.471 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
of what bone-like structures
we have underneath all of this.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So that's what we get up here 
in these corner images.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They're still not
great as far as finding

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
all those small details I think
are critically important when

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
we're trying to figure out, 
is this legitimate?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.402 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Is this actually organic?

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Or is this something that
somebody put together?

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
What's interesting here, we
have spine, which is right here.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.329 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We've got arms.

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.121 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
We've got legs.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But we're still seeing
those three digits

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.293 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
in this specimen as well.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We have sort of this
remnant of a chest cavity.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
But it's just so
incredibly small

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
compared to what you
and I would have.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It's possible for
somebody to make it.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:59.187 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
But they did a really good job.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.814 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
If they did, they did
a really good job,

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because it would be quite
a challenge, I think,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.321 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to make the kind of detail.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But kudos to them if they did.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
[NARRATOR] Carbon dating taken
from the samples of Victoria

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:22.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
indicated that the age was
between 987 AD to 1145 AD,

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:26.172 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
which makes her over 
700 years younger than Maria.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.181 align:middle line:21% position:50% size:56%
[JAY] I want to stress
something here.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
It's a completely
different species,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.228 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
even though they both share
many, many characteristics--

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:45.066 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
three-fingered hands and feet,
and longer legs, longer arms.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.069 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But they do not appear
to be the same species.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.613 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I think it's going to be
a big challenge for science

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:54.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and scientists to really
explain all of this.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And right now,
what we have to do

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:01.958 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is to focus in the incredible
features of these bodies,

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.753 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and then probably try
to relate them,

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and try to probably,
through them,

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
solve some of the big
mysteries of history.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.386 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned 
for more DNA analysis

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:17.348 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and updates on the bodies
found in the tomb.
