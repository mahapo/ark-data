00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:03.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
[MAN] We were 
supposed to see 

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:07.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
one of the most important
discoveries of the 21st century.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:31%
[NARRATOR] 
Nazca, Peru.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.178 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
Home of 
one of the most

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.931 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
mysterious archeological 
sites on Earth.

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:16.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A new mystery has emerged 
from this remote location.

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:22.105 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And it takes us 
from what we see 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
above the ground
to what lies below.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.698 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
We get a lot of leads
here at Gaia,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.701 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
regarding new discoveries 
or investigations,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.412 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
but one particularly
interesting lead came to us

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
from a journalist 
named Jaime Maussan.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:41.708 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
[JAIME] My name 
is Jaime Maussan.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.794 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I am an investigative
journalist,

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.921 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
and I have been working 
as a journalist

00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.257 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
for the last 47 years 
of my life.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
[MELISSA] He got word 
of some mummies in Peru

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.053 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
that didn't look human.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:57.975 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
We decided to go to Peru
and examine and see

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
if these were fake or real, 
or what were they?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.521 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Our crew jumped 
on an airplane

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.232 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and flew from Colorado 
to Lima, Peru

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
with cameras and
everything in tow.

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:10.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Jaime also took 
a camera crew with us.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:11.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
We also took scientists.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
We have a very important 
mission here in Peru.

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:18.287 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:35%
I came here 
because it was

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:22.708 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
a group of scientists,
professionals, journalists.

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Once the scientists arrive, 
the body is revealed,

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.338 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and they get to analyze it 
for the first time.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:29.131 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
[JAY] When he 
brought it out

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:31.133 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
and pulled it 
out of the box,

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
it was a stunned silence 
at first.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.388 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[DR. KOROTKOV] It was 
a prepared mummy.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:40.976 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The size of this humanoid
was 168 centimeters.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.478 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It was practically my size, 
a little bit shorter.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:49.484 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So it means that this was a
person who was walking as we do,

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:56.199 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
who was able to move hands 
as we have, with long legs.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:59.953 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So the proportion of the body
was very similar to ours.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.373 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It is an absolutely
authentic hand

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:07.127 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with three long fingers, 
very long.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.254 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
[DR. BENITEZ] The three fingers
is a characteristic

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
that makes it unique 
and unforgettable,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.176 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and that is what
exactly makes us think

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:17.679 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
that this does not belong
to a human species.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
[DR. KOROTKOV] Then, of course,
very important-- the head.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That, of course, was 
the most amazing.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:30.901 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
It wasn't our rounded skull, but
it was a very protruded skull.

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:36.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Very clear. And on the skull as
well, it was very, very natural.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Very interesting, 
they had eyes and nose

00:02:38.784 --> 00:02:41.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and no ears, 
only little holes.

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:46.458 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
[JAIME] The mummies are covered
completely in this white dust.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.001 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
But it's not just white dust,

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:53.673 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
it's something that is going 
to really dry the skin,

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:57.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and the skin will be able to
survive for so many years.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[JAY] When Konstantin 
pulled out the sample,

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
and we saw 
the gray skin.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then I knew because 
I know that bodies,

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:07.813 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
when they reach that
level of decomposition,

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.856 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
they turn this 
kind of slate gray.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So that, I felt 
really good about.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.568 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[MELISSA] One of the most
important things

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I think that we can do, 
is to take samples.

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.781 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
And the samples
are important

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:18.615 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
for a couple of
reasons,

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Carbon-14 testing 
and DNA testing

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
where we can figure out 
how old the possible creature is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.125 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
and of course what 
the genetic make-up of it is.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
One of the labs that we sent a
sample to, for Carbon-14 dating,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.886 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
came back, and the results were
anywhere from 245 AD to 410 AD.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
One of the coolest things
that we got to do,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is we got to take the body
to get CAT scanned,

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and we are currently getting 
all of the information

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from the CAT scans analyzed.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.357 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Could somebody
have gone in here,

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:56.027 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
and they did something 
with the skull to change it?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.946 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They did something with
the hands to make it

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:58.864 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
have this appearance?

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:05.036 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Based on the images that I'm
seeing here, it seems unlikely.

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
[MELISSA] Professor Korotkov 
and his team in Russia

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.377 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
also analyzed the body, and
they've actually discovered

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.879 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
some very interesting evidence.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.261 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
In layman terms, a mummy 
is when organs are extracted.

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:24.306 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
So this is technically 
not a mummy.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:29.227 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
However in this case, 
the body was mummified

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.062 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
but the organs 
were not removed.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
What was interesting is,
right after we saw the body,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.611 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we began looking 
at some nearby petroglyphs,

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:41.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and we discovered a humanoid
figure in the petroglyphs

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.158 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the mountains 
that had three fingers.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.243 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
[DR. KOROTKOV] 
I've seen many images

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:48.079 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
of South American cultures.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.082 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I would think it's the
imagination of someone...

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:56.379 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
all myths, all religious
beliefs of ancient peoples.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
They are based
on some reality.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[JAY] So we're wondering what
we are really dealing with here.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[MELISSA] Gaia is completely
committed to this story.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We're going to let you know if
it's human, if it's non-human.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.769 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Like I said, our whole mission
is just pure curiosity.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.603 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
What could it be?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And to honestly give a
journalistic approach to that.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.943 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That is our mission. And that's
what we hope to bring to you.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.071 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
This is just the beginning.
This is not the end,

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.824 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
not even with the samples.
There is so much more to comb.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:25.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[KONSTANTIN] 
From my point of view,

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.162 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
there is no way 
that it is some deformity

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the human body.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:35.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It is absolutely a different
structure of all skeletons.

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:39.965 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And it belongs to another
creature, another humanoid.
