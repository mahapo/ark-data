[NARRATOR] Nazca, Peru, home of
one of the most mysterious

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
archaeological sites on Earth.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A new mystery has emerged
from this remote location,

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:14.556 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and it takes us from what
we see above the ground

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.724 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to what lies below.

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Professor Korotkov
and his team have

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:29.655 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
discovered that the
strange creature is female.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:32.783 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
They were able
to extract DNA.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.826 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They confirmed
that this is female

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.746 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because there
was only X strands.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.081 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
[RUSSIAN SPEECH]

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:43.752 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
From the DNA samples of
the mummy now known as Maria,

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:47.589 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
we were able to identify
that this is a woman,

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.591 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
as the Y chromosome is missing.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[NARRATOR] The team also
confirmed in the DNA process

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.556 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a strange herbal smell 
that came from the sample.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.143 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Some experts suggest 
that it came

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.688 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
from the mummification process.

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But the question still
remains, was this creature

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:09.278 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
preserved by humans
or non-humans?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.615 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
As we wait for more
DNA results, the team

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:17.119 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
still ponders the recent
findings of the Carbon-14 data.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The results state
that the body has been

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:23.959 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
dated between 245 and 410 AD.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.546 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
After the team scientifically
dissected the body,

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
they decided to research
the surrounding area to see

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.926 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
if there is anything that they
could find that would link them

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
to these bodies.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:37.347 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
What was interesting is
right after we saw the body,

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we began looking at
some nearby petroglyphs,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.854 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and we discovered a humanoid
figure in the petroglyphs

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:45.689 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in the mountains that
had three fingers.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.276 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So we're wondering what we're
really dealing with here.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:54.489 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
I've seen many images
of South American cultures.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.075 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I would think it's
the imagination of someone.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:02.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
All myths, all religious
beliefs of ancient people,

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.416 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
they are based on some reality.

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:09.963 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
There's a relation between the
presence of these individuals

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.049 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and what the ancient
cultures of Peru drew.

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:18.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Because they had contact, 
they saw them,

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and they represented them.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.976 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
[NARRATOR] Is it possible that
these beings with three fingers

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.146 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
actually interacted with the
ancient civilizations of Nazca?

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.941 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.944 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
The five metacarpals are
merged through three bearings

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.237 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
to three fingers.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:46.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Three fingers have
five to six phalanges,

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
meaning that they are way
longer than human hands.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's not clear for us
how they used these fingers.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:02.766 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But it's clear that it's much
more flexible than our fingers.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.643 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
We can grip.
They can touch.

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They can-- Absolutely.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.273 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But we know from our
technology that we have these

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.234 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
two, three fingers, and
they operate very well.

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:15.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Of course, it's a
human-like creature.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
It is 100% sure.

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:20.367 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It is humanoid-like creature.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, 
back in the United States,

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:27.165 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a musculoskeletal
radiologist, MK Jessie,

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
takes a look at our CAT scans.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:33.463 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
I am very curious to see
what these images look like.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.675 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
I think what I can offer,
looking at the images,

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.802 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
looking at bones 
all day long and having

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:45.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the expertise in bone, the
bones of any mammalian skeleton,

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
they're incredibly complex,
which is a good thing for this,

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
because they're going to be
extremely hard to reproduce.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.694 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So I think we'll be able
to tell if these are truly

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
authentic bones.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Looking at this
skeleton, obviously we

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
have a really
humanoid-looking bone.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:06.997 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We've got the eyes that
are facing forward.

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We've got the mandible
with, you can see,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.295 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
rows of teeth both
above and below.

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The shape of the
skull is interesting.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's very elongated,
an atypical appearance

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:23.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of a human skull
like you and I know.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.099 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Looking at the rest
of the skeleton,

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.144 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we have a thoracic spine 
that's holding the ribs,

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:30.896 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
or your rib cage, or the chest.

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:35.108 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
All of that looks very
humanoid as well--

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
femurs, we have the
tibia and the fibula.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
All of that is pretty typical.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.865 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And then even in
the forearm here,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you have bones called
the radius and the ulna.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.621 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Now, what's 
interesting here is

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.458 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we see there is a
collection of bones here.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is called the
carpus of the wrist.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's a typical appearance,
but as we move outward,

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:04.596 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we're seeing really
three distinct fingers,

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.515 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
which is fascinating.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The skull-- I don't
see any suture lines.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.105 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There's no bones that are
separate in the skull.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They all appear fused.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So this appears to
be a solid structure.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.031 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In the hand, coming
from the carpus,

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:28.119 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
not only do we see three,
and only three, fingers,

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but you have enlargement
of the bones as well.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So we're seeing the same
thing happening in the feet.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.837 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The metacarpals and the
phalanges-- metacarpals

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.466 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
are in the palm of the hand,
phalanges of the fingers.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So if we look at where
the metacarpals would lie,

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.471 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
these are very--
they're very thick bones.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.184 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
They're much thicker than bones
that you would find in my hand

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
or in your hand.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:55.772 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Same thing with the phalanges
as well, or the finger bones

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
are very robust.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I came with hope,
but I wasn't certain.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I came only with hope.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now that I've had the
opportunity to analyze it,

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
see it, have it in my hands,
take x-rays,

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:16.626 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
view radiological studies,
comparison research,

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:20.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and to hear the opinion of other
experts in different fields

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.843 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
sharing their scientific
opinions, which are similar,

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
almost identical--

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:31.683 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we all agreed and came to the
same conclusion and opinion.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.982 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
None of the scientific
studies mention human-like

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.484 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
beings that have three fingers.

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.111 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
There's no mention.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
There's no scientific study.

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.616 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
It is historic.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.659 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
It's going to change
many paradigms.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's going to totally change
many concepts and ideas

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.372 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in science and biology.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[DR. KOROTKOV] With this, we
have tremendous cultural change.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:02.213 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It can change the consciousness
of humanity as a whole.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.801 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Finally, we accept
that what we know--

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that we know that we don't know.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:13.016 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And all our concepts about
history, about development,

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
those are just concepts.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this opens up absolutely
new page of history.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Without physical
evidence, everything else

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.441 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
was just fairy tales.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:25.028 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
Once we have the results,
we need to present this

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.321 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:33%
to the world.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
The world will decide.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.784 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I'm not telling them,
and I'm not telling you.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.036 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But I know that there
is no other creature

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like this creature
anywhere else.

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.753 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If we're not able to
determine with certainty

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:46.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
its origin, we would have to
assume that here on Earth

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:50.053 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we would write in the
anthropology, paleontology,

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.307 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
anthropometry and natural
history books a new species

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:59.145 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that we haven't seen,
that doesn't exist,

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that's not registered, and
we don't have any record

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
of on Earth.

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
From my point of view,
it is no way that it is some

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
deformity of human body.

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:16.204 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
It is absolutely a different
structure of all our skeletons,

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.375 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and it belongs to another
creature, another humanoid.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[NARRATOR] Smaller bodies 
have also been discovered,

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:27.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the team is hoping to gather
DNA from these creatures that

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
were found in the same location.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.595 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A lot of the white resin
that's on the body has been

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.514 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
kind of wiped off, so
you get to see the skin.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.141 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It looks kind of
like a lizard skin.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And we're going to
be taking samples

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
in the next few minutes.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.771 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[NARRATOR] Stay tuned 
for the next update.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.357 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
