[NARRATOR] As the investigation
continues on Maria,

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the team analyzes several
smaller bodies that were

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
discovered in the same tomb.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.761 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It looks like
the entire spine,

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which would be chest cavity 
and the lower spine,

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:19.853 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we're bearing what resembles
ribs almost all the way down.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[NARRATOR] Samples of the
strange white powder

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
covering the mummies 
found in the tomb

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:31.573 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
were sent to a lab 
for identification.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They concluded
that the powder is

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.788 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
most likely a naturally sourced
sample of diatomaceous earth,

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
which contains the
fossilized remains

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.252 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
of tiny aquatic
organisms called diatoms.

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
Their skeletons are made of a
natural substance called silica

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.549 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and contain mineral
grains such as quartz.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:54.054 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Commercial diatomaceous earth
has a wide range of uses,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
such as water filtration, filler
in paints and other coatings,

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.685 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
or as an absorbent,
among others.

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:02.813 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
The team plans further
research into this.

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Meanwhile, back in Cusco--

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.155 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
I came to Peru for
the first time in 1998,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.241 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
nearly 20 years ago.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.535 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
My group and I had
the opportunity

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.079 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
to find dozens of
archeological sites

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.209 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
from the Incan culture in
both Cusco and Madre de Dios.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Thierry got word of these
bodies from a man named Mario.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.344 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mario has helped in discovering
many well-known sites

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
here in Peru
since the 1990s.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So he knows very
well what he does,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.103 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and he knows what he has found.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And what he has found does not
belong to any known culture

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.859 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
in South America.

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.612 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Inside this tomb
in a secret place,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
he found two sarcophagus.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.534 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
In one of them,
just pure objects.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:01.913 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
And in the second one, 
he found two small bodies,

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:07.419 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
or two medium-sized bodies
and many little bodies.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.548 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The big body was
outside the sarcophagus.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:13.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Mario didn't accept to
give us an interview.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And at same time, he didn't
accept to take us to the tomb.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:23.393 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Because he's afraid
that somebody else

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:24.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
is going to find this,

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:26.813 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and he's going to lose
whatever is inside.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:32.277 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Mario has told us that he
thinks that he has only touched

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
10% or maybe even
less of the site.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.951 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
How far do these tunnel
branches and levels go?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
We don't know.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
[NARRATOR] The team joins
Thierry to examine the remains

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that have been sent by Mario.

00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:50.837 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
Here we go.

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:55.217 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
When they first pulled out 
two little bodies,

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:59.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I was I was somewhat surprised
by how real they looked,

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.891 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and how the cranium
was so curved.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.645 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And there were even like,
small features on it

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:09.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that would seem to be
extremely difficult to fake.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:16.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Jaime's forensic doctor
was visibly shook by it.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He came fully prepared
to find nothing,

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.451 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and had his world rocked.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
[JAIME] Too perfect 
to be hoax.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
The pieces are organic.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
He doesn't have any doubt.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.387 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
[NARRATOR] The team
decided to name

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:43.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the couple,
Alberto and Josephina.

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The team takes the bodies 
to get X-rays,

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.938 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
with the help of Dr. Edson.

00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:51.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:54.443 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
First, from
the physical exam,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:58.989 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
we reviewed that in the pelvic
cavity, there was a bump.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.077 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So we are thinking many things,
such as maybe its last meal,

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
or maybe something else.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.123 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Or maybe a gestation.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
We are going to take two X-rays.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:17.007 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
First, a frontal X-ray,
and then a lateral X-ray.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.137 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then we went, and we
saw how the X-rays were taken.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:27.517 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And what we found was that
this creature had eggs inside.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.899 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In the pelvic cavity, we
see the presence of eggs.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.991 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
We were able to see 
that the specimen female

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:47.704 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
has a cloaca fissure like
reptiles in its lower body,

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.207 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
inside and across what
would be its legs.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This indicates, as it would
with reptiles, the possibility

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.422 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that it would deposit the
eggs using the conduit.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.845 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
These oval structures do allow
us to see the part behind them,

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.765 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the consistency,
which determines them

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to be translucent.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:12.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Meaning they consist 
of an organic substance.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It is a species with facial
features and anthropometric

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
characteristics
similar to reptiles,

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but that has a
humanoid appearance.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Definitely, the aspect of
reproduction that we can see

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.998 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
in these beings is important.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Evidently, this tells us
that evolution has not solely

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
occurred in mammal form like us.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[JAY] So we have a humanoid
being walking the planet with us

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
at some point in the past
that was not a mammal.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The female smaller
humanoid that had the eggs

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.523 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
also had a metal
affixed to her chest.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The metal implant is
on top of the thorax.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.573 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It does not penetrate the skin.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:08.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It is very difficult
for this to be fake.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.749 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
There are too many
correct characteristics.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
This is original.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Evidently, it is not human, 
due to many anatomical

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.593 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
characteristics that are not.

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:28.138 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But it keeps a
certain similarity,

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:31.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
due to the anthropomorphic
structure that it has.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:37.355 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
These humanoid reptiles
have human characteristics

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:41.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of the head, cranium,
two eyes, and a mouth.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:45.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But they don't have visible
nostrils or an auditory canal.

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:48.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the structure of its
superior and inferior

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.954 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
extremities is 100%
equivalent to the structure

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.247 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of a known reptile.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:59.044 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
But the structure of the
core, thorax, and abdomen

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
is very similar to
a human structure.

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Its bipedal appearance
suggests that there has been

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
a convergent evolution process.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.305 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This convergent
evolution can explain

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the different biological
nature of these beings

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
in bipedal form.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:17.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:20.398 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The shape of the spinal
column and bone disposition

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:24.194 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
tells us that this specimen was
upright, and that it walked.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.532 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Above all, the interesting
aspect about these bodies is

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.326 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that they are suitable
to be intelligent.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We see great cranial
capacity in them,

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:40.835 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the unique characteristic of
hominids, which we belong to.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:44.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It has, in relationship
to the cranium,

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:52.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
an almost nonexistent jaw, which
measures 2.5 to 3 millimeters.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.687 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This measurement makes it
practically impossible to chew,

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.397 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
but it does allow swallowing.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It doesn't have dental flanges
or a pyramidal nose structure.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:12.992 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But it does have the two
nostrils, same as reptiles.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.495 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And the orbital rims
are too big when

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
compared to the cranium, which
indicates that it has big eyes.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
We can count the vertebrae.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.221 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
11 vertebrae.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Then, in the
bones of the hand,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.479 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we can see what are the
phalanges, three phalanges.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Absence of the
carpal bones,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.026 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
just like the other bones
in the other samples.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:08:49.612 --> 00:08:52.323 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The anatomical
characteristics of this

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
specimen displays only one bone
in the forearm, not like us,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.163 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
with two.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And it's hands and feet
end with three fingers.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Moreover, they only have one
bone that articulates directly

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:08.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
to the feet.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:16.222 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I have seen many cadavers and
many human skeletal structures,

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and they do not appear
like this at all.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
These have very
specific characteristics

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.523 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that make them unique,
and completely different

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.983 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
from a human being.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:31.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
All of them analyzed, and
they said, this is incredible.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
This is amazing.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.282 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
These creatures were organic.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.242 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
These creatures were alive.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.828 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I have never seen a
creature like this in my life.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:43.416 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I am only more and more
intrigued as to what it is,

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.461 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
what are its origins, and
where did it come from?

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:48.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:52.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We face the discovery of
a new species never before

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.803 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
described in
scientific literature.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.681 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
the team was not able

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:00.767 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to take samples 
from these bodies,

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
as Thierry had concerns 
over damaging them.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.523 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So the team felt it
was important

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.068 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to get more opinions
on the CAT scans.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.655 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
The bones of the
arm are atypical.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
So we have this bone,
which is the bone which

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.328 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
would be up by your shoulder,
coming down to your elbow.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:25.917 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
OK, that one could be a variant
of what we know to be normal.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
But the forearm
should have two bones,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and we only have one bone 
in this specimen.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Similarly, as we get
down to the foot,

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.511 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you typically have two bones,
the tibia and the fibula.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.097 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
And we just are seeing one.

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:43.434 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
There's also a slightly
atypical appearance

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:46.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of what we call the femur,
which is your thigh bone,

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:49.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and where we're seeing
some potential growth plates

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.276 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
in the femur.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:58.408 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So this skeleton,
it follows some

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of the normal
developmental patterns

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:05.665 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of a humanoid or
mammalian skeleton.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.626 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But we're seeing 
some variation,

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:10.086 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
namely in the number
of the bones.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And in this one,
I think we do have

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.799 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
a decreased number of the bones
in the hand and in the foot.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And then, also, a
decrease in the number

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:21.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of bones in the forearm
and in the lower leg.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.641 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It looks like the
entire spine,

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.979 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
which would be chest cavity
and the lower spine--

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:33.318 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we're bearing what resembles
ribs almost all the way down,

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.779 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which is more reptilian, 
in a way.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.824 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
If you think about a snake, and
it' s got rib-like structures

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:43.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
all the way down
its entire body.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The other thing
that's interesting

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
is the length of the neck.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It does seem out of proportion
to the rest of the spine.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:54.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The neck, or cervical spine,
contains seven vertebrae

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that are generally smaller.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And the thoracic
spine contains 12.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:03.139 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And I would say that the
length here is pretty similar.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.475 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[MELISSA] So here is another
one of the small bodies.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:10.897 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
[MK JESSE] We have very
similar appearance,

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:12.982 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with the very 
small chest cavity,

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
very small abdominal cavity,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.403 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with what looks like ribs
coming all the way down

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.865 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
to near the pelvis.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You can see the iliac crest,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:25.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and then it looks like there's
a rib at least right above it,

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
if not directly overlying it.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:32.585 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
These densities that
are in the pelvis...

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:40.635 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
we know that they have calcium,
because they're showing up.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:44.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We know that calcium
is more dense.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:53.106 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Typically, when we radiograph
eggs in a bird or in a reptile,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
they appear as very faint.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They have a very faint
rim of calcification,

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
and inside, you
have the yolk,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you have all of the liquid
components that don't really

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
show up on an X-ray.

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:08.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So that would be
my first statement

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about these structures, is
that they are ovoid-shaped,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.797 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but you would not necessarily
anticipate that they

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
would be quite so dense.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.094 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Although we don't really know
how long these have been there.

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:28.933 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We don't really know if maybe
they calcified later on.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.393 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
It's a possibility.

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:34.022 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But we talk about
congruency of joint spaces,

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.231 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
too, as being very important.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.151 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And that means that it looks
like one bone is supposed

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.028 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to fit with another bone.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:43.906 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And just focusing on a
couple of the specimens

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:48.786 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
here in the shoulders, and then
what we can see of the hands,

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
it seems to fit that
congruency, which again,

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:56.586 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I think would be very
difficult to replicate.

00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
[NARRATOR] The CAT scans
were also sent

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.758 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to Dr. Korotkov's team 
in Russia.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:02.717 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
[DR. KOROTKOV] 
Very important

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:08.181 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
was analysis of X-ray 
and CAT scan.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:12.643 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
Because again, it was done by a
group of top-level scientists,

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
researchers, doctors,
medical doctors,

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:20.276 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
who are doing thousands of this
type of analysis for human,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.986 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
for people.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.946 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And of course, they are
top-level specialists.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.656 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.326 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
The skeletons are very
different from the skeletons

00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:29.327 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
of modern humans.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:35.041 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:41.047 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
There are a lot
of differences.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
First, the front of
the skull is different,

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in that we don't see
paranasal sinuses,

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.387 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and can't see the bone
structure of the nose,

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:51.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
such as we are accustomed
to seeing in humans.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The nose looks to be
in the form of cracks.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.021 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Maybe they had some
other way of breathing.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:03.069 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Also very different is the
structure of the lower jaw.

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It is presented in the
form of a thin plate,

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.533 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and spliced with other
bones of the facial skull.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.285 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The act of chewing involves
not only the muscles,

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but its mandibular joints,
which they don't have.

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.792 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Apparently, they were
not able to chew.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:18.626 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
[DR. KOROTKOV] 
With these creatures,

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
we have several samples now. 
And we know that there are more.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.134 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
So it is clear that
it was some line.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:32.598 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
So at the moment, we understand
that those subjects

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:35.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which was found,
which was analyzed--

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.855 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
those are absolutely
unique subjects.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:43.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They present two different
lines of creatures.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:47.029 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
human-like, not human-like.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:53.161 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
At the moment, we have no idea
what was their genetic line.

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:56.956 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And it would need much more
research, much more study.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
But finally, we'll
get this results.

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[NARRATOR] The team took the
opportunity to compare Victoria,

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:06.841 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
who was found in a seated
position, to Alberto,

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.509 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
who was in a standing position.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:13.472 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
We can see clearly that
we have a small chest cavity,

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:14.515 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
small chest cavity.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We have a little bit of
a seemingly or relatively

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:24.442 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
elongated neck
region here and here.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
That's pretty similar.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:31.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then again, with this,
we have three digits.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:35.703 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That's also kind of
a uniform finding

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.413 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that we're seeing
across the board here.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:41.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Yeah, when you look at
what's striking about these,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
what seems atypical, that chest
cavity again very, very small.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.968 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I think if it's smaller,
maybe in that other specimen.

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But I would say that's
the most striking feature,

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:59.435 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that and that we're getting
the three digits again.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:04.607 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So it has enough of
a resemblance where

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:10.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it makes you really
suspect that there's

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
some connection, either if
somebody constructed these,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.453 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that the same person did.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.417 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Or there's some
other relationship.

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.337 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I don't think that that
would be too far of a stretch

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.129 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
to suggest.

00:17:27.129 --> 00:17:28.965 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NARRATOR] Victoria 
was carbon dated

00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:33.052 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
to be from 987 AD 
to 1145 AD.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.471 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
And the team is still
waiting on DNA results.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.517 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Coming up, the team
examines a new body

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
recovered from the tomb.

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:42.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It appears to be a baby,

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and they have named 
this one Wawita,

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.984 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which means baby in the
Quechua language.
