00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Has a new humanoid
species been discovered

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
in the mountains
near Nazca, Peru?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.253 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; We are living in a
very exciting moment.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is pure history
in the making.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Have scientists working
around the world proven that

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the Nazca mummies are genuine?

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; The results strongly supports
that these beings are not

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:34.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
closely related to any
known organism on Earth.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Is there a concerted
effort to discredit and deny

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
the evidence?

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.674 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; The Ministry of
Culture, until last Friday,

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
was interested in participating.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But for unknown reasons,
they've backed down.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.948 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; If it was really an ET mummy,
they should be able to show CAT

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:50.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
scans and X-rays
of the individual.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.286 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; They have done
X-rays on them.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.954 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Is that something the
Ministry of Culture

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.989 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
would be interested in?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.959 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Never-before-seen footage of
the location where the bodies

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:59.826 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
were found.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; It's clear that this
was some hidden place.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.698 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Maybe there are more subject.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; New high-resolution CAT
scans that contain startling

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:08.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
revelations.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Inside, he was able to detect
the feathers of some creature.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It is clear by scientists
that it's something different.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
It is not human.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:24.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; "Unearthing Nazca."

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In 2016, a rare
find was discovered

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in the Palpa region,
south of Peru,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.203 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
very close to the
mythical region of Nazca.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.506 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
A huaquero, or tomb
raider, found a group

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:49.343 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of mummified bodies
with surprising physical

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:50.944 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
characteristics--

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:55.015 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
hands with three fingers
and elongated heads.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:57.217 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
According to his
account, he found them

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:01.888 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in a secret tomb, of which
only he knew the location.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:04.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The subsequent testing
on these bodies

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:08.962 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
revealed extraordinary facts,
such as their ancientness

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and the fact that it was
a biological organism.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.969 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
At the same time, the
tests opened more questions

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.906 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
of what these mummified
beings could be.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The country's government
officials and archaeologists

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:26.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were very adamant about
not being involved.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.817 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Yet, they let the testing
continue privately.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:35.422 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
What did this huaquero
really find that day in 2016?

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And why have the local
authorities not taken part

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.964 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in the research of what could
be an unparalleled discovery

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
in Peru?

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:50.003 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Is this a well-orchestrated
fraud by a tomb raider?

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.839 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Or are we facing
a blatant attempt

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to discredit such an
astonishing finding?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And if so, for what purpose?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.717 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is the story of a group
of scientists and journalists

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
from different countries looking
to gain access to the mummies

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
and discover the
truth, no matter

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.425 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
what the barriers might be.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If you are questioning why a
grave robber should be trusted

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with such a find, we want
to bring to your attention

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that sometimes the most
astonishing finds in history

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.045 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
can be uncovered in the
most unorthodox ways.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:35.715 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We are not condoning the
idea of robbing graves.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.618 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We are simply saying that
throughout history, there

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:42.322 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
have been discoveries found
by such a person that changed

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.825 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the course of history
and what we thought

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.963 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
we knew about ancient cultures,
such as the case of the most

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
ancient biblical texts on
record, the so-called Dead Sea

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.904 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Scrolls, written in
Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.974 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The scrolls were found by
Bedouin shepherds looking

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:05.512 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
for their goats in a cave
of the Qumran region.

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:07.848 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They gathered as much
as they could carry

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and sold some of the scrolls
to the highest bidder

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.088 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and used the rest for
kindling for a fire.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.991 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This find not only
became a source of income

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for the shepherds,
but it provided

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a wealth of comparative material
for New Testament scholars,

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
including many important
parallels between Christianity

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
and Judaism.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
On the other side of the
world, a similar story

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.911 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
took place in Peru in 1987.

00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Authorities became
aware of a magnificent

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
find after a disagreement
between two grave robbers that

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.654 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
led to the discovery of
the Lord of Sipan tomb.

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This discovery was
compared to the excavation

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.492 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of King Tut in Egypt.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:56.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
An almost completely
intact ancient burial,

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.533 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
which is a rare and
dazzling discovery.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It was quite rare
for archaeologists

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:05.005 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to have access to a tomb
which is nearly complete,

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:07.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
like the one they
found with Lord Sipan.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:10.677 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This allowed new discoveries
by archaeologists

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and historians' previous
knowledge of the Mochi culture.

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:18.952 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This story also begins with
a tomb radar, or huaquero,

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:21.454 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
who we will call Mario.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
When entering a secret
tomb, he found something

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.927 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that he had never seen before--

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:30.096 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
several mummies with very
different characteristics

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:34.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to humans, like very strange
heads and hands covered

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
in a white powder.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Without specifying
the exact site,

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:42.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
he said that it was in a
desert between Palpa and Nazca

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in the department of Ica,
an archaeological area

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:49.115 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in which several
remnants have been found.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:53.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
According to those who still
conduct this illicit activity,

00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:56.623 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
it still hides many
more treasures.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.025 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Because of his
expertise, Mario knew

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.462 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that he had found
pieces of great value.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:06.433 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To be absolutely certain,
he contacted Thierry Jamin,

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:09.035 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
director of the
Institute Inkari,

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.738 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a nongovernmental
organization located

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:15.942 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in Cusco dedicated to the study
of the historical Peruvian

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
heritage.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The purpose of showing Thierry
the pieces he had found

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.617 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
was to know if they
were authentic or fake.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.223 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:33.493 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Locals from this region of
Peru, from the countryside,

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.463 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
sometimes come to us with
archaeological samples,

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
ceramics, and other artifacts,
as well as their accounts about

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.703 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
such-and-such a site
they've discovered.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:49.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
In October 2016, we received
one of those visits.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.112 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The group was in possession
of several artifacts--

00:06:52.112 --> 00:06:54.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
little bodies, heads, and hands.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They were looking for
our professional opinion

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:01.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
and support.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
They wanted our help in
disclosing the findings.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.527 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Our first impression was
that they were authentic,

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:12.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
given our expertise in
analyzing mummified objects.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.635 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Immediately, we realized the
significance of the findings

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and thought it was
a breakthrough.

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:22.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We felt we did not have the
right to keep it to ourselves.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:24.944 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; The information was
uploaded to the internet,

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
so it became public knowledge.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.716 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Immediately, people
from all over the world

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:32.619 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
were interested in the
findings and ready to conduct

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.623 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
a deeper investigation of the
pieces shown on the internet.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:41.194 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; In October and November
2016, I saw some videos through

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:45.498 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
internet and YouTube of this
man in Peru presenting little

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
bodies that didn't look human.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
He presented a huge hand.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.906 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
It didn't look human.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:55.408 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
He said that they
were found in a tomb

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:58.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the middle of the
desert near Nazca.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then I didn't pay
attention, because I

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
thought they were fakes.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:03.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
It's a hoax.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
I don't like it.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:09.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I don't feel right when
someone wants to be anonymous.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:15.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
But in March 2017, a biologist
called me and said, Jaime,

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:16.429 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
look at this.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.997 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
This is very interesting.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.633 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Have you talked
to Thierry Jamin?

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
He's a French archaeologist
living in Cusco.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
And I say, no.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He said, don't you
want to interview him?

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:33.213 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And then I interviewed him in
my program in the internet,

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and I thought this
was very serious.

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:36.616 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I thought this was
very important.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:41.087 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I thought this man had my
credibility, Thierry Jamin.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:44.958 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And I said, I have
to go to Peru.

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Jaime Maussan contacted
Gaia to see if they wanted

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.965 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to investigate the bodies
with him and his team.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:58.304 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Our real mission on taking
this lead and following Jaime

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to see these bodies was
just to see what it is.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.412 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We're just literally
there because we're

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
curious of what it might be.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Several crews-- consisting of
camera operators, translators,

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
journalists, and
forensic experts--

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:18.958 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
headed to Cusco, Peru, to see
the pieces for themselves.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Thierry believed
the best thing to do

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.663 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
was to alert the
authorities, as well, so they

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
could join in the discovery.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:31.538 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
On January 11,
2017, Thierry Jamin

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:35.708 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
sent a letter to Dr. Jorge
Nieto Montesinos, director

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
of the Ministry of
Culture in Peru,

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:40.613 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to inform him of the
findings and to request

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.516 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
his participation in
the investigations.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:47.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
However, an official
response was never received.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.828 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; I got in touch with the
Peruvian Ministry of Culture

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.997 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
at the beginning of January
in order to make them aware

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
of the case.

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.901 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
We were worried
for the possibility

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that this archaeological
treasure trove would

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:06.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
be taken out of the country.

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.043 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We acted promptly to try and
make the government intervene

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:13.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
before the pieces disappeared.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
I never received an
official response.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
An archaeologist
named Alberto Jacinto,

00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:22.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
head of the culture
department at Nazca,

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.991 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that got in touch
with me via email

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to let me know that
the minister in Lima

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:32.131 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
had assigned him the case and
ordered him to investigate.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.968 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But I never received a direct
answer from the ministry

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:40.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
through a letter, as I expected,
in reply to our letter.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; The null answer from the
Peruvian government left those

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.947 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
interested with no other
alternative but to become

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the investigators and
researchers themselves,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to try getting to the
bottom of the matter.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.823 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Little by little, an
interdisciplinary group

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of professionals took
shape, with people

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:01.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
from five countries.

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:05.131 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It included scientist
Konstantin Korotkov from Russia;

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
journalists from
Mexico and Peru,

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.204 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as well as the journalistic
team from Gaia in the US;

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:16.609 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
biologists and forensic doctors
from Mexico, the US, and Peru;

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:19.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
as well as archaeologist
Thierry Jamin from France.

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:26.953 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
With their combined efforts
and individual abilities,

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they would try to reach
an objective explanation

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:32.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
to such a discovery.

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:35.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The team knew that despite
the excitement and optimism,

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it would be necessary to
compile evidence that could

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.035 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
prove the discovery to be real.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So they began the trip
to Peru with hopes

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.074 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to meet Mario and gain
access to the bodies that had

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
caused such high expectations.

00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:52.111 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.547 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; We were in contact with
all the players involved

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:55.949 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
in the finding.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
We will start our
research in order

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.954 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to establish the
authenticity of the pieces.

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.323 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; I've only seen the
photographs and the X-rays,

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.991 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
and I'm very impressed with it.

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:09.462 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And I think this could be one of
the most important discoveries

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:12.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
ever in the history of
the human race, actually.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:16.402 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Well, we are ready to start
this important trip to Peru

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:21.007 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
to find out if these bodies are
really not human or if they are

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
just an elaborate hoax.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.678 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The results that we
are going to find

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.882 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
through forensic scientists,
biologists, and investigators

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.485 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
are going to be very important.

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; But things in Peru would
not be so simple for the team.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.192 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Gaining access to
the bodies would

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:43.529 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
be much more complicated than
they had anticipated initially.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:46.532 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The team had to
negotiate in length

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
just to gain access
to the bodies.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:55.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The first palpable evidence
was given to the team in Cusco

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:57.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
at the Institute Inkari.

00:12:57.243 --> 00:13:00.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Its director, Thierry Jamin,
showed several objects

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:04.751 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that Mario agreed
for the group to see.

00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:06.919 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Being face-to-face
with the objects

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:11.557 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
created an atmosphere of
excitement and expectation.

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:15.695 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
At the same time, it required
them to capture as much data

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:20.833 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
from the pieces as possible
without losing objectivity.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
The first pieces
of evidence were

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
two strange elongated heads.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.347 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; In this piece, there
is a very small mandible--

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:36.683 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
very small.

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
In the second piece, we can see
the atlas, or C1, the vertebrae

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
that sits just below the skull.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
We can see some grooves.

00:13:48.628 --> 00:13:50.263 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
There is also what
could be considered

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:56.969 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
a mouth, nasal sinuses, a nose,
and also orbital cavities,

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:59.005 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
very prominent.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:01.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Those cavities are crossed
by grooves in both pieces.

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:07.947 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Both pieces are very similar.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; But were they real?

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
During the first
trip, the team learned

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:16.122 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that someone who had been
associated with Mario

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:20.693 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
showed the Ministry of
Culture a three-fingered hand.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.196 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
The Ministry labeled
it as a fraud.

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.699 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
They declared that the hands
had been intentionally mutilated

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:30.703 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
by removing two fingers and that
smeared plaster was giving them

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.538 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
a mummified appearance.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Additionally, the
Ministry concluded

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:39.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that the transformation was
done in a workshop in Nazca.

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
These assertions would certainly
complicate the investigation.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.986 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Ministry would condition
the Peruvian scientists

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to be incredulous and ready
to discredit any information

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
related to this finding.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:55.328 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Why would the
Ministry of Culture

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
look at this piece
of evidence and not

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the other bodies Thierry
wrote them about?

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.202 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The team continues
to investigate

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:06.005 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
all the findings
to see if there was

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:09.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
evidence of something organic.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
In this first
visit, Thierry Jamin

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:13.913 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
showed the group
a couple of bodies

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
about 60 centimeters
in length, which

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:19.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
had an organic appearance.

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:22.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Furthermore, one of the
bodies had a strange bulge

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:26.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in the belly, much like that
of a gestating organism.

00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:28.628 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:32.698 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; In this being, we find
the joints both in the elbows

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
and lower limbs.

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:37.403 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Also, there are hip joints.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:42.608 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There is a small bulge in
the stomach, near the hips.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.679 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; We need radiographs
or, better yet,

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:52.084 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
CAT scans in order to determine
what this protrusion is.

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:55.454 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; The group moved to a clinic
to perform X-rays and CAT scans

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.991 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
on the bodies and find out if
they actually had an internal

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
bone structure.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The group also
wanted to learn more

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.265 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
about the bulge in the
belly in one of the bodies.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:09.202 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
While performing the
X-rays and CAT scans,

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:13.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
they discovered some interesting
structures inside the body.

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.012 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; This is a very
important image,

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.949 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
as it allows us to
observe the bones--

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:26.552 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
the skull with its bone
consistency, but also the metal

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:29.655 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
within its chest.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:33.993 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
This piece of metal won't allow
us to see the bone underneath.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This metal piece is embedded
in the chest of the object.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.033 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It blocks the view
from the bones behind.

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:44.971 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
However, when we reach the
pelvic cavity or lower stomach,

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:48.841 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we see three structures
with an oval shape.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
These structures do allow
rays to penetrate and show

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the bone structure behind.

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:56.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
&gt;&gt; You can't see
it in radiographs,

00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:02.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but upon physical
examination of the specimen,

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:06.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we noticed a structure
between the legs that could be

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
identified as a birth canal.

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:12.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We can't be sure,
but it is consistent

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:15.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
with similar structures in
species such as reptiles

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that develop and lay eggs.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.511 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; The team was
definitely impressed,

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.948 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and so Mario
promised more bodies.

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
They continued with
the investigation.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The team moved to the
southern part of the country,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
to the Nazca region.

00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:40.293 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This place is known worldwide
because of the lines

00:17:40.293 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and figures carved into the
sandy, desert-like floor that

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
can only be observed
from high altitude.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The structures date
back some 1,700 years,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which coincides with a time
the Nazca culture flourished

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:55.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
in the region.

00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:59.211 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The lines in the Nazca
figures, the geometric shapes

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:03.215 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and the diverse animals, such
as birds, monkeys, spiders,

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:05.551 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
hummingbirds, and
even a whale, are

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:09.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
scattered over an area which
covers several kilometers.

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Each figure varies in size.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:15.661 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They can measure just a
few meters or hundreds.

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
According to some
studies, the figures

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.866 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
could have served as an
astronomical calendar,

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.835 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because several of
them are positioned

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:26.072 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to indicate equinoxes
or solstices,

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:29.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
as well as the movement
of planets and the moon.

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:32.745 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Thanks to the absence
of rainfall in the area

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:35.014 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the mineral
composition of the terrain,

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:38.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the traces remain almost
unchanged to this day.

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Near this area, in
the region of Palpa,

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the team was taken
to a secret place,

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
where Mario promised to have
a big surprise for them.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.834 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
From the beginning,
Mario refused

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to give the exact
location of the tomb.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
However, if an
agreement was reached,

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:03.075 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
he would be willing to show them
a larger, unique mummy, which

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
they had discussed.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
He took the group to the
top floor of his house,

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:10.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
where after more
negotiations, he finally

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
agreed to bring the piece.

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; We have a very important
mission here in Peru.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I came here together
with a group

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:23.629 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of scientists,
professionals, journalists,

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:29.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
because we have
more supposed to see

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:35.641 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
maybe one of the most important
discovery of the 21st century.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.544 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; Mario placed the box
in front of the team.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:41.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Inside was the mummy--

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
life-sized and in
the fetal position.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.086 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It looked almost
human, except for

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:49.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
some remarkable differences.

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:53.959 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The mummy had only three
fingers with four phalanges

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
in its hands and feet.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:59.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The head had an elongated shape.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:02.234 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It was covered with
a white powder.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Unlike the Egyptian mummies,
this was a desiccated body,

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
apparently by natural methods.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:13.946 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It showed no signs of decay
and was in excellent condition.

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:17.616 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:21.821 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; We have before us a body
of anthropomorphic structure.

00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:26.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It has a head, neck,
thoracic cage, pelvis,

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:28.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and upper and lower limbs.

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:33.632 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Specifically, in the head, we
notice a well-articulated jaw

00:20:33.632 --> 00:20:34.333 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
bone.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:38.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
No oracles, but auditory
canals on both sides.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:44.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; It can change the
consciousness of humanity

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:46.846 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
as a whole.

00:20:46.846 --> 00:20:50.749 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And all our concepts about
history, about development,

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
those are just concepts.

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:56.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this opens up absolutely
a new page of history.

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:01.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
No doubts that it is
tremendous discovery.

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; The piece was named Maria.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.198 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The team took
samples of the body

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:09.735 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to be tested in different
laboratories in Russia,

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:13.305 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the United States,
Canada, and Mexico.

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:17.409 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The X-rays and topographies
that were performed on Maria

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.945 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
showed surprising
results and confirmed

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:24.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that it was an organic
being with a bone structure.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:26.452 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Konstantin showed
some of the scans

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:31.056 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
to the head of image analysis at
a medical institute in Russia.

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:34.827 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:37.263 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; We performed a CAT scan
of a mature individual,

00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:40.833 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
a mummy referred to as Maria.

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:43.969 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It is the skeleton of a
person with an anomaly.

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:46.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
It's three-fingered.

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.874 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
If we consider the
traditional notion,

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.676 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
the mummification
process involves

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:52.945 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
removal of internal organs.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:55.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So technically,
this is not a mummy.

00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:59.718 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But if we consider that the
body was mummified naturally,

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:02.621 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
meaning the organs were
simply not removed,

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.724 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
this is a skeleton that
is very well preserved.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:10.529 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And we were able to clearly see
many details in our CAT scans.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.199 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
All the structures and
bones in the main body

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:17.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
are visible in the
analyzed tomography.

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:20.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; If I understand correctly
that some organs remained,

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:22.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
does this prove that
it is a real body?

00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:26.946 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; I would say yes, because on
scans of the back of the skull,

00:22:26.946 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
we saw structures that are
less dense than bone structures

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:35.421 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and most likely are hydrated
remnants of the brain.

00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:39.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Gaia also found a radiologist
at a hospital in Denver,

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:42.194 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Colorado, to take a
look at the scans.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.998 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; I am very curious to see
what these images look like.

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:49.301 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I think what I can offer,
looking at the images,

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:53.539 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
looking at bones all day long
and having expertise in bone,

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:57.943 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the bones of any
mammalian skeleton,

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:01.847 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
they are incredibly complex,
which is a good thing for this.

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Because they are going to be
extremely hard to reproduce.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So I think we'll be able
to tell if these are truly

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
authentic bones.

00:23:10.456 --> 00:23:14.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Looking at this
skeleton, obviously we

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:17.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
have a fairly
humanoid-looking bone.

00:23:17.463 --> 00:23:19.965 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We've got the eyes that
are facing forward.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:23.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We've got the mandible
with, you can see,

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
rows of teeth both
above and below.

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:29.008 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The shape of the
skull is interesting.

00:23:29.008 --> 00:23:34.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's very elongated, an atypical
appearance of a human skull

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:36.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
like you and I know.

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:38.817 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Looking at the rest
of the skeleton,

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we have a thoracic spine
that's holding the ribs,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
or your rib cage of the chest.

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
All of that looks very
humanoid, as well.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.963 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Femurs-- we have the
tibia and the fibula.

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:52.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
All of that is pretty typical.

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.533 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And then even in
the forearm here,

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.969 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you have bones called
the radius and the ulna.

00:23:56.969 --> 00:24:00.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now, what's
interesting here is we

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:04.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
see there is a
collection of bones here.

00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:07.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This is called the
carpus of the wrist.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That's a typical appearance,
but as we move outward,

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:17.423 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we're seeing really
three distinct fingers,

00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:19.124 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
which is fascinating.

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:24.129 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The skull-- I don't
see any suture lines.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:26.932 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
There's no bones that are
separate in the skull.

00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:28.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
They all appear fused.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:32.971 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So this appears to
be a solid structure.

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.973 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In the hand, coming
from the carpus,

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:39.945 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
not only do we see three,
and only three, fingers,

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:43.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
but you have enlargement
of the bones, as well.

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:46.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So we're seeing the same
thing happening in the feet.

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:49.755 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The metacarpals and the
phalanges-- metacarpals

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:51.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
are in the palm of the hand.

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Phalanges are the fingers.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So if we look at where
the metacarpals would lie,

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
these are very thick bones.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.035 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
They're much thicker than bones
that you would find in my hand

00:25:03.035 --> 00:25:03.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
or in your hand.

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Same thing with the phalanges,
as well, or the finger bones

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
are very robust.

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:14.446 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; If the CAT scans and X-rays
proved it was organic bone

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and the bones didn't
seem to be altered,

00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:20.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
could this be evidence
of a new species?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The team didn't want
to jump to conclusions.

00:25:22.955 --> 00:25:26.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So they waited for the samples
to give them more evidence.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The first tests done
with the samples

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:32.197 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
was to determine what
the white powder was.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
The white powder
that was coating

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:37.836 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
the bodies, said to be plaster,
was actually a substance

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
called diatomaceous earth.

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:44.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
This diatomaceous earth is a
fossilized microscopic algae

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:48.113 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that formed on the Earth
during the Pleistocene era.

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This powder has desiccant
and absorbent qualities

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.887 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and can also function
as a natural fungicide

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and insecticide, which certainly
helped preserve the body

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.527 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and kept it free of
external pathogens.

00:26:01.527 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Another fact is that there
are deposits of this substance

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.965 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
very close to the Nazca area.

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:10.836 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And also, this substance
naturally occurs in some caves.

00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:13.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But what does it
mean that the bodies

00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.307 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
are covered with this powder?

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:18.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Could the bodies have
been placed in these caves

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
with diatomaceous earth?

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.547 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Or could this
substance have been

00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:26.318 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
placed on the body
in an unknown ritual?

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:28.454 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
At this point in
the investigation,

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:32.224 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the team was informed of the
discovery of two more bodies.

00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:36.295 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It was a headless body, about
60 centimeters in length,

00:26:36.295 --> 00:26:40.966 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and the body of a baby with the
same characteristics as Maria.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Both were covered
with a white powder.

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:45.737 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
According to Mario,
these two bodies

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:48.207 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
were found in the
same tomb where

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:49.942 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the others were discovered.

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:53.345 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The baby's body was
named Wawita, which means

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
baby in the Quechua dialect.

00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:58.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The headless body
in a seated position

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:00.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
was given the name Victoria.

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The Wawita topography
showed the mummy of a child

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
with a formed skeleton
in the fetal position.

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:09.962 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Both hands had
three fingers each.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But there were signs
of finger removal.

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:16.401 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The right hand had four visible
bones of the metacarpus.

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:20.072 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The left had three bones
of the metacarpus and signs

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of bone removal.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Was this body tampered
with by Mario and his team?

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.881 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Or could the body have been
modified hundreds of years ago?

00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:32.818 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And if this was the case,
what was the reason?

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:35.954 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The team decided to focus on
the other bodies, of which they

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:39.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
could not find evidence of
bone removal or tampering,

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:42.628 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because test results
were still coming in.

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:46.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
By now, the results of
the carbon-14 dating study

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:50.035 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
conducted on Maria by the
laboratory of the Universidad

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:53.205 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Nacional Autonoma de
Mexico were received.

00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The results dated the mummy
to be 1,770 years old.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.747 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
This placed it in the
period of the Nazca culture

00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:06.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
flourishing, thus proving
that the mummy was not modern.

00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:10.889 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Gaia also did their own testing
at a facility in the United

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:12.624 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
States called Beta.

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And the numbers came out
to be the same for Maria--

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:19.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
approximately 1,700 years old.

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:25.203 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The smaller body, Victoria,
was dated around 800 AD.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:27.639 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
But there was still
more testing to do

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:31.076 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
on the bodies that would
prove or disprove what

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
these bodies might be made of.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:37.683 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Samples were taken again from
the bodies for DNA testing.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:40.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The team was hoping to
see if the DNA matched

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:45.624 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
any modern human species or any
other known biological species

00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:47.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
on the planet.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.996 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This result could help decide
if there was a serious case

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:53.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to keep investigating.

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:57.135 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Meanwhile, the null answer
given by the Ministry of Culture

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:00.505 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and the constant attacks
by Peruvian anthropologists

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:04.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and archaeologists were
discouraging for the team.

00:29:04.276 --> 00:29:08.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
This adverse climate
hindered investigations.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.516 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Members of the team reached
out to archaeologists

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to come look at the bodies
and decide for themselves,

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.955 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
but they refused.

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Instead, many attempts
by these parties

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:22.628 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
were made to discredit
any information surfacing

00:29:22.628 --> 00:29:24.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
about the mummies.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.699 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In tests and research
carried out by the team,

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the participation of Ministry
scientists still, to this day,

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
has been non-existent.

00:29:34.473 --> 00:29:36.942 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Journalist Jaime
Maussan sent a letter

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:39.044 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to the Peruvian
Minister of Culture

00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to request a meeting in which
he could talk about the findings

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and results of the
investigations carried out

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.818 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
thus far.

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
He hoped that the
ministry would join

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.555 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
in the research
of something that

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:54.693 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
could be a great archaeological
discovery and to allow

00:29:54.693 --> 00:29:57.429 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
them to revise the
evidence firsthand.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But the result was
not what he expected.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:03.301 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Very disappointed.

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:07.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We expected to be treated
by the Minister of Culture

00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:09.641 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
here in Peru.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Unfortunately, they sent someone
from second or third level

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:17.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to tell us that we should
send an email requesting

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:20.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for something like this.

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
It's very unfortunate.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I think they don't
have any interest

00:30:24.623 --> 00:30:27.993 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to cooperate and to do
any kind of investigation

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:30.662 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
around this case.

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:35.967 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It's very unfortunate to
find the truth for everyone--

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:40.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
not just here in Peru,
but around the world.

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:43.875 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; But the team carried on
to find some kind of truth.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.044 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The samples that were
taken by Konstantin

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:50.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Korotkov on the last visit
were tested in Russia.

00:30:50.082 --> 00:30:53.285 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The first DNA analysis
performed in Russia

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
by the Institute of
Analytical Chemistry

00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:57.956 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
at the University
of Saint Petersburg

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:59.891 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
took just over a month.

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:03.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Dr. Mikhail Aseev oversaw
the DNA extraction,

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:07.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and the results showed that it
was an organic specimen that

00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:12.137 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
once had life, specifically
of a female creature,

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:16.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because the DNA included
the X chromosome.

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:19.878 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; When our scientists
in Saint Petersburg,

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:25.951 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
in one of the top laboratories,
was able to make DNA testing

00:31:25.951 --> 00:31:27.819 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
of this big body.

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:32.758 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And this DNA have
only X chromosomes.

00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:34.659 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
It means that this is a lady.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.129 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
This is a female.

00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:39.631 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Now, of course, they
need to make next level

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:42.634 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
of, next stage of research.

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:46.037 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They need to make
sequencing of this DNA.

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:51.076 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It means to define genome
and define all genes

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:55.947 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and compare those genes with
existing libraries of genes.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:59.818 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; From the first results of
the DNA test practiced on Maria,

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
new questions arose.

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:06.625 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Although it was an organic
body more than 1,700 years old,

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the three-fingered
hands and feet

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
still needed to
be tested to prove

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:13.532 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that they were real, as well.

00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:17.035 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Besides, more samples needed to
be taken off of the other three

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:19.971 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
bodies and from Wawita.

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:23.041 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
It would be necessary to remove
tissues from the mummy's feet,

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:26.945 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
hands, and body again to
check to see if they, indeed,

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:29.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
belonged to the same individual.

00:32:29.014 --> 00:32:32.918 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
But convincing Mario to
allow taking new samples

00:32:32.918 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
would not be so easy.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
At first, the fear
that the bodies

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:41.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
could be severely damaged made
him profoundly refuse any more

00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:43.762 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
sample extractions.

00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The team explained
the need to take

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.667 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
those samples to verify
that all parts of the body

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:51.203 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
belong to the same subject.

00:32:51.203 --> 00:32:54.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
An arduous negotiation was
necessary to convince him

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:56.641 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of the new collection
of samples,

00:32:56.641 --> 00:33:01.947 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
but he finally agreed, only for
the bodies of Maria, Wawita,

00:33:01.947 --> 00:33:03.415 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
and Victoria.

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:08.553 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Josephina and Alberto
were off limits.

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.956 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
According to Mario,
three more bodies

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:13.758 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with similar characteristics
to the previous ones

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.827 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
were discovered
in a nearby cave.

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:19.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
These three bodies, close
to 60 centimeters in length,

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:22.534 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
also had three-fingered
hands and feet

00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:24.202 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
with an elongated skulls.

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The three bodies were
given a nickname--

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.973 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
The Family.

00:33:27.973 --> 00:33:30.842 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
They were covered with
the same white powder

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
as the previous ones--

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.679 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
diatomaceous earth.

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
But where was this tomb?

00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:40.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The team wondered if they were
ever going to see this cave

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:43.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and how many bodies actually
existed in what Mario

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:46.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
referred to as a large tomb.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:50.695 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
They, just like the
archaeological experts in Peru,

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:53.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
wanted to know that an actual
tomb or location of the bodies

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:54.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
existed.

00:33:57.969 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
To summarize, with these
additional three mummies,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.075 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
six bodies thus far
had been presented

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:08.046 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that were approximately
60 centimeters in length.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.282 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
Three of them had
been given names.

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
They were Alberto,
Josephina, and Victoria.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.956 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Two of the mummies had
human characteristics--

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:22.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a life size known as Maria and
the baby they called Wawita.

00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:26.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Also discovered were
three three-fingered hands

00:34:26.665 --> 00:34:27.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
and two heads.

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:30.535 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It is not certain that these
are all the pieces that

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:34.839 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
exist because of Mario's
inconsistent accounts.

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
He sometimes did mention that
there could be many more.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:42.047 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Even Thierry Jamin suspects
that some of those pieces

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:45.216 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
may be moved out of Peru.

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:47.419 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.323 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Mario got in touch
with me in January,

00:34:51.323 --> 00:34:54.993 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and we met in Bolivia in the
city of La Paz with a lot

00:34:54.993 --> 00:35:00.298 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
of secrecy, because he is
a very mistrusting person.

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We sat down, and I tried
to convince him not

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:06.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to sell any of the
artifacts, telling him

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:10.742 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that his name would go down
in history as the man who

00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
made the great discovery.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
But he would not listen.

00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:16.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
He only cares about the money.

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:20.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Mario is a huaquero, a
professional tomb robber

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:24.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
for over 25 years with
high-level contacts

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:28.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from Brazilian politicians
to Peruvian heads of state

00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:31.997 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and renowned archaeologists
here in Peru.

00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; Could Mario have been
selling to the highest bidder?

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And if this were true, how was
this jeopardizing the case?

00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:43.241 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Could the stalling by the
Peruvian government or negative

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.076 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
press provided by
people convinced

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:49.514 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it was a hoax actually have
aided in a more sinister plan

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to cover it up?

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The team could only suspect
these things without proof.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.958 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
In the meantime, they need
to continue gathering data.

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:03.528 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Samples taken from the
different areas of Maria's body,

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:07.432 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
especially the feet, hands,
pelvis, and under the arm,

00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:10.335 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were analyzed by DNA
tests at the University

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of Saint Petersburg.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The tests connected the
tissues from all these areas

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.975 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
to the same body.

00:36:16.975 --> 00:36:20.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It disproved the theory of
some Peruvian archaeologists

00:36:20.078 --> 00:36:24.015 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that it was a body built with
parts of different creatures.

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:29.988 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The test also revealed
something very interesting.

00:36:29.988 --> 00:36:33.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Please tell me, what progress
have you made to analyze

00:36:33.258 --> 00:36:34.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
our specimens?

00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:37.429 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; We've carried out an
elemental analysis of these

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:38.463 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:25%
specimens.

00:36:38.463 --> 00:36:41.833 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And generally speaking,
the data that we received

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.636 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
allows us to make a
conclusion that it

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:48.406 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is an ordinary set of
elements, except for cadmium.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:50.942 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
We have found cadmium
chloride on the surface

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:52.343 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of these specimens.

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:54.846 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Actually, the specimens
were obviously

00:36:54.846 --> 00:36:59.617 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
covered with cadmium chloride
and diatomaceous earth.

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:03.088 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; As far as I understand,
cadmium chloride is not found

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:04.489 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
at all in nature.

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; It needs to be
acidized, extracted,

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:12.697 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
then transformed into a soluble
form, into cadmium chloride.

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:15.633 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
It also needs to be
purified, for sure.

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It is a complicated procedure.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.507 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; So it is unobtainable or
impossible for the primitive

00:37:22.507 --> 00:37:23.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
civilizations?

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:26.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Is this correct?

00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:29.247 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; If they do not have
concentrated acids and simple

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:32.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
chemical reactors, then
it is really impossible.

00:37:32.984 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; It is clear that
all the subjects,

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.624 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
they were processed
with cadmium chloride.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:42.827 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
And those elements
may be created only

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:45.196 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
by highly developed
civilization.

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:51.236 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's not simple people living
in Nazca area, different tribes,

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:54.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
who was able to make
this chemical process.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.841 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Our European civilization
came to this process

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.010 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
only in the mid-19th century.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.079 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Now we use a lot
of cadmium chloride

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:05.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
in our civilisation to
preserve different subjects,

00:38:05.817 --> 00:38:09.454 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
because this is the
best preserver that

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:13.958 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
kills all bacteria, all
contaminations and viruses.

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:20.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So we use it in our modern life,
but it doesn't exist in nature.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:25.203 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; Unusual discovery,
but what did it mean?

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:28.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
As the team waited for
more specific DNA results,

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:32.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Mario agreed to take
some people to the cave.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.749 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
He invited Peruvian journalists
Jois Mantilla, Thierry Jamin,

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:42.654 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
his team, and Dr. Konstantin
Korotkov to show them the site.

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:44.822 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
They departed from
Palpa and entered

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:49.627 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
an area of arid mountains, where
it would be easy to get lost.

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:53.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
After a few kilometers, they
descended from Mario's old car

00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:57.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and began a hike
along the rocky path.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:59.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Later, the trail
disappeared, and the group

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:04.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
had to climb, making their
way between the rocks.

00:39:04.042 --> 00:39:07.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
An hour later, they
arrived at the cave.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.847 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The entrance was
covered by stones,

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:14.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which helped it go unnoticed,
except to Mario's expert eyes.

00:39:14.953 --> 00:39:17.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
After visiting the
cave, it was clear

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:21.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that this cave was covered
in diatomaceous earth.

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:25.129 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But could this be
the actual cave?

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:29.867 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; In those mountains, there
are no grass, no vegetation,

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.402 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:35%
nothing alive.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
So they're totally dead.

00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:34.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
And it's a big contrast.

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:36.975 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
You look there, you
see beautiful place

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:38.943 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with a lot of trees
and everything.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:42.747 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You look here, you
see only rocks.

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:46.618 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
When we came to the cave, the
cave itself, it's not so big.

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But it's not like
a cave which had

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
been used by ancient people,
where they can make fire,

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:53.558 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
where you can sit together.

00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:54.292 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:8%
No.

00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:55.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
It's just a little cave.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
All this cave was
covered with this dust.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It was not only on the
floor, but all around,

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:05.236 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so it was, again, clear
that it's natural material.

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:08.706 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
First of all, I don't believe
in anything Mario tells.

00:40:08.706 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's clear for me, clear,
that the cave we were taken,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.512 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
it's not the only cave.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.847 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; There was a lot of
controversy surrounding

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
the location of the site
as different groups of tomb

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.989 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
raiders pointed to
different locations,

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:28.826 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
none of which corresponded
to what had been described.

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:34.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Mario finally decided to contact
us and show us the place.

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.334 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Getting there was
very difficult.

00:40:36.334 --> 00:40:37.969 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Only someone with
local knowledge

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.639 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
would be able to find it,
because to the untrained eye,

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:44.409 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
there was no way of telling
the entrance to the cave,

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:48.012 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
as it was covered
by small stones.

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:51.082 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When we got to the place,
we did not believe it,

00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:53.951 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
because we had been told
it was a citadel with walls

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:56.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and a gate, many chambers
with inscriptions,

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.455 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and there was none of that.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:04.696 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We were disappointed, because it
was not the story we had heard.

00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:08.633 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I was upset, confused, and
disappointed all at once,

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:11.002 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
because Mario is the
sole source of the story.

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:16.307 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
In journalists work,
you cross-reference

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
several accounts to find
the truth on a story.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.713 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
But when you have
only one source,

00:41:21.713 --> 00:41:24.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
only one person to
tell you that story,

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:26.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you either believe
them or you don't.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.221 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If the bodies are real,
the story can be real.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.625 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But in this case, his
original story did not match.

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:38.029 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Having said that, several
features did match.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:41.766 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
The smell on the cave was
similar to that of the mummies.

00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:43.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The space distribution
also matched.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:48.306 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
We saw the exact location where
Wawita, Maria, and the family

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:51.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of two-foot beings were found.

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:53.077 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Those calculations
make it likely

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:56.848 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that this was the place
where the mummies were found.

00:41:56.848 --> 00:42:02.253 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But there were definitely
no ruins or ancient citadel.

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:05.323 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; This fact was a
disappointment for the team.

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:10.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The tomb, so frequently referred
to, did not exist as such.

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:13.698 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
However, the cave shown
coincided in many ways

00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:16.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with some of the characteristics
found in the bodies.

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Therefore, despite
the disappointment,

00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:21.239 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
it was plausible that
the mummies could

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:22.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
have come from that place.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.513 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
More genetic results
came trickling in.

00:42:28.513 --> 00:42:32.984 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There were DNA results from
Mexico and from Russia.

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:36.821 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; The sequencing process
itself is run on a device called

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:38.222 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
the genome sequencer.

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:40.958 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
In our case, we use
two sequencers--

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.529 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
one for the primary
analysis, MiSeq sequencer

00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:47.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and HiSeq sequencer--
for comparative analysis

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.967 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of the genomic DNA.

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A great amount of data is
generated after sequencing.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:57.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
This data is generated
in the machine.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.343 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
After this data
has been generated,

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they are transferred
to a computer.

00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:04.849 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And then our colleague,
Alexei, a bioinformatician,

00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:07.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
used them to analyze the data.

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:11.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
He found out that there were
actually ancient samples,

00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:13.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and we could yield the
ancient DNA, and we have it.

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.927 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The fact that this
ancient DNA has

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:18.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a lot of variations that are
alternative to the standard

00:43:18.496 --> 00:43:20.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
genome is quite interesting.

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In other words, it tells
us that we actually

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.469 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
have unique and new data.

from Maria and Wawita.

approximately 23.8%

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:09.547 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
could explain these
strange bodies.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:11.949 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That possibility was
explored, and the results

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were around a 10% match
in strict conditions.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.755 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And even relaxing some
of the parameters,

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:22.193 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we could not get a 100%
match with human DNA.

00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:25.863 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The analysis included a
vast array of species.

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.632 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
One of the software
programs we used,

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:30.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
in particular,
performs comparisons

00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:32.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
with more than a
million species,

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which allows us to approximate
as much as possible the sample

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
with the DNA of all
currently known species.

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:42.947 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Some species were
a higher match,

00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:46.651 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
some plants and bovine DNA, but
still in very small portions.

00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:52.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I have to say that this
sample contains DNA

00:44:52.924 --> 00:44:54.959 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that we currently don't know.

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:58.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It could be from an organism
that has not been studied.

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:01.632 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Perhaps there was some
microbiological contamination

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:02.967 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
of the samples.

00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:06.837 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But it could also be original
DNA from these bodies.

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:09.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
That means that these bodies
could belong to a previously

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:12.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
unknown species.

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:16.013 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; The genetic results were
also showed to William Brown,

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:18.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a biophysicist from
Southern California,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:24.221 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and his take on the tests
were very interesting.

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:32.964 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; Of the DNA that was isolated,
only 25% of the total matched

00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:36.867 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
any known human gene.

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:41.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So that means that
75% of this DNA

00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:47.612 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is not matching any known
human reference sequence.

00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:54.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And this is pretty rigorous,
because there's, like,

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:57.421 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the Thousand Human
Genome Project, where

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:01.058 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
they have done whole genome
sequencing of over 2,000

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:04.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
individuals from every
continent on Earth

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:10.501 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and compiled kind of like a
average human reference genome.

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:14.905 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And so you take these sequences
isolated from the sample

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:18.943 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
with this being and you
go going you compare them

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:21.512 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to that human
reference genome data.

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:25.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
And only 25% match up.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:28.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
75% don't.

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; DNA sequencing can
take months or even years,

00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:34.759 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
depending on the
questions asked.

00:46:34.759 --> 00:46:37.028 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Given the small
samples the team had,

00:46:37.028 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
they wanted to ask
the first question--

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:44.402 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
could this DNA match
any known modern DNA?

00:46:44.402 --> 00:46:47.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that answer came
out as no from the lab

00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:52.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the Mexico team used in Canada
and also the team in Russia.

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:56.881 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Is it normal for all labs
in different countries

00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:58.549 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
to come up with
the same results?

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:02.219 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
&gt;&gt; I'm Dr. Doug Taylor.

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:06.057 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
I'm a professor of biotechnology
here at Harrisburg University.

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
My background is I have a PhD
in biochemistry and molecular

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
biology.

00:47:10.528 --> 00:47:13.197 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
When you think about
any parameters that

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
are associated with
or methodologies

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.970 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for sequencing DNA, how is
it different from one place

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.905 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
versus another?

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:24.742 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; I thought that there just
was a set DNA sequencing process

00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:26.911 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
across every country,
across every lab.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But you're saying
that's not the case.

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:31.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If you could explain DNA
sequencing differences

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:32.516 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
in other countries.

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:35.219 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; Start with DNA
sequencing, it's evolving.

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
What is the question
you're trying to ask?

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:41.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
That'll determine how do
I go about isolating this.

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:44.962 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And it can vary from lab to
lab or country to country.

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:50.701 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
But also comes a next question,
is what am I trying to answer?

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.304 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And what specific
population of DNA

00:47:53.304 --> 00:47:55.005 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
am I trying to look
at where I think is

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.841 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
going to give me that answer?

00:47:56.841 --> 00:47:59.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And that may
determine, OK, well,

00:47:59.009 --> 00:48:01.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I need to put in this
intermediate step, which

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:04.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
is going to enhance that
population of DNA, which

00:48:04.415 --> 00:48:06.016 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
is going to make it
more likely that I'm

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.252 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
going to get an answer.

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:11.956 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This is an incredibly
interesting find.

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:15.693 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And it really needs
to be looked into.

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.195 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I think it's kind
of an exciting time,

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:21.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that different groups can
apply different expertise.

00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:25.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We're no longer these little
individual groups anymore.

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You have a global community.

00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:30.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We can bring everyone
together on the global scale

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.943 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to look and provide different
expertise in order to answer

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
some of these questions.

00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:36.847 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Is it human, yes or no?

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:41.619 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But beyond that, what does
it mean for humans as a race?

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:44.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; The DNA samples were
also taken from Victoria,

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:48.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one of the smaller bodies,
and the results were also very

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
surprising.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.329 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; Of course, it was very
important for us to make DNA

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:54.431 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
test of little creatures.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:59.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And we didn't want to
disturb big little ones,

00:48:59.637 --> 00:49:03.407 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
because they are so
tiny that, of course,

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:07.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
it should be done only in very
special conditions, in very

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:09.947 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
sterile room, in
special atmosphere.

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:15.953 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So we didn't want to make
it just in simple room.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
That's why we had only
access to headless one,

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where it was possible to
get samples from the neck.

00:49:23.661 --> 00:49:27.865 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
First conclusions, both
in Russia and in Mexico,

00:49:27.865 --> 00:49:29.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
was it is not human.

00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:35.339 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So of all known to us
DNA of organic life--

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:42.112 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I mean human, animals,
plants, bacterias, microbes--

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:46.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
there are no correlation
with DNA of Victoria.

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:49.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
No match at all.

00:49:49.954 --> 00:49:53.557 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So that's why it is clear
conclusion by scientists

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that it's something different.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
&gt;&gt; For the experts
involved in this case,

00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:03.300 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it's clear that this is
something amazing and never

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
before seen.

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:08.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But there was still
more data to gather,

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.641 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
data that would
compare their DNA

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:14.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
sample to other human
species on the planet,

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:18.682 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
such as Neanderthal
or Denisovan.

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
To take more samples
of the bodies

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.953 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and to compare the
DNA of these creatures

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:28.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to other human species, the
Gaia team traveled back to Peru.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:33.297 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This time, they were accompanied
by scientist William Brown, who

00:50:33.297 --> 00:50:35.132 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
had a special
interest in getting

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:38.402 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the samples into a specific
lab in the United States.

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:40.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; And what are you possibly
going to be doing with

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:41.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
the samples on your end?

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:47.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; So if we are successful
in retrieving samples,

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:56.253 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I have labs that I work with
where we can do a very thorough

00:50:56.253 --> 00:51:00.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
cleaning of the sample
to reduce contamination.

00:51:00.124 --> 00:51:04.628 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And we can do the kind of
DNA sequencing and analysis

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:09.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that will definitively
show the nature

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:13.704 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
or origins of the bodies.

00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:18.242 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Another scientist and PhD
from Russia, Dmitry Galetsky,

00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:20.945 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
accompanied Konstantin
Korotkov to gather data

00:51:20.945 --> 00:51:24.214 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
for their ongoing study they
had going in their labs.

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.951 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; How do you feel that your
expertise is going to forward

00:51:26.951 --> 00:51:28.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
this case?

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:29.553 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:32.556 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; This is such an
interesting moment in terms

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:35.626 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
of the anatomical
analysis of the CT scans.

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:37.962 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And of course, what
I would like to see

00:51:37.962 --> 00:51:40.931 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
are the tissues, the
composition of the tissues.

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.300 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
&gt;&gt; Do you feel that the small
bodies are more interesting

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
than Maria and Wawita?

00:51:45.336 --> 00:51:46.971 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
&gt;&gt; The little ones
are very interesting.

00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:48.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
First of all,
there's more of them.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:51.608 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
There is Josephina,
Alberto, and the rest.

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:53.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And their skulls have
variance that can be analyzed.

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:56.847 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Their anatomy is
absolutely amazing.

00:51:56.847 --> 00:52:00.317 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; On the trip, Gaia journalist
Melissa Tittl managed to get

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Carla Vargas from the
Physical Anthropology Cabinet

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.890 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of the Ministry of Culture
of Cusco to talk to her about

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.827 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the strange bodies
found in Nazca.

00:52:09.827 --> 00:52:11.962 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Melissa wanted to
find out why they

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:15.532 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
were reluctant to join the
investigation of this finding

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:17.968 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and what their
impressions of it were.

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:21.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
&gt;&gt; What do you think of the
Nazca mummy that came out that

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:22.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
people are saying is a hoax?

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.541 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:28.946 align:middle line:10% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Well, apparently, based on
the information that we've seen

00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
on the internet, in the news,
and so on, it looks like

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:36.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
a mummy that has been altered to
give the impression that it is

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:41.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
not of earthly origin, that it
would be an extraterrestrial

00:52:41.458 --> 00:52:42.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:16%
mummy.

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:45.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
What we have been able to
see, based on the photographs,

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:48.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
is that the hands of the
mummy, it is a real mummy.

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.702 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
But it has been altered
with those purposes.

00:52:51.702 --> 00:52:53.971 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Some phalanges have
been removed, as well

00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:56.240 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
as some other bone
parts, and other parts

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
have been added to it.

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:03.881 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; So it's a real mummy, because
it's positioned that way.

00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:06.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
But you're saying that
the phalanges, the fingers

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:08.952 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and the toes, those
have been altered?

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.954 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; They have been altered, yes.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.492 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
If it was really
an ET mummy, they

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:20.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
should be able to show CAT scans
and X-rays of the individual,

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
but they only
showed a photograph.

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:26.070 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
There are no further studies
that would give credence

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.970 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to their claim.

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:30.974 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
It would be nice
to be able to see

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:34.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
an X-ray from the individual
to be able to determine

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:37.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
if it suffered from a
certain pathology or disease

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
or if it had a condition
that made it different.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.920 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
&gt;&gt; They have done
X-rays on them.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:49.426 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Would you be interested in
seeing the body or the X-rays

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:50.627 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
or any of that kind of stuff?

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:51.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Is that something the
Ministry of Culture

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.097 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
would be interested in?

00:53:53.097 --> 00:53:54.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:57.501 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; In principle, the
Ministry of Culture,

00:53:57.501 --> 00:54:00.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as the official body in charge
of protecting our cultural

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.974 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
heritage, the first
question would be,

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:07.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
where did these
mummies come from?

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Why should we give
a voice to someone

00:54:08.946 --> 00:54:12.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that is destroying our heritage,
someone who is carrying out

00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:15.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
clandestine excavations?

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:19.089 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Then, if the individual is able
to support his or her research

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:23.427 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
or work, I think the Ministry
would be willing to study it,

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:26.763 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
but I don't think
that will happen.

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:29.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
&gt;&gt; After the interview with
the official of the Ministry

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:33.070 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of Culture of Cusco, the team
went to the Inkari Institute

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:37.241 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to grab more samples, where
Thierry Jamin informed them

00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:39.943 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
that the bodies
have disappeared,

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.945 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and he doesn't know
where they are.

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.614 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
&gt;&gt; So everyone knew
we were coming,

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:45.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
but then they just
took the bodies.

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:47.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And now we're just sitting here.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:50.254 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
&gt;&gt; Well, we don't know
that they took no bodies.

00:54:50.254 --> 00:54:52.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
&gt;&gt; But he's put them in a place.

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.123 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; A month ago.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.224 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
&gt;&gt; A month ago?

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:15.712 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; They've changed places--

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:19.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
they've changed mummies from
place more than three times

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:21.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to guarantee the
security of the mummies.

00:55:21.952 --> 00:55:24.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
&gt;&gt; Without more DNA tests, they
could not ask more questions.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:31.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
For everyone involved
in this case,

00:55:31.962 --> 00:55:35.465 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
they felt that they had
interesting information,

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.968 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
but at every turn,
there was a block

00:55:37.968 --> 00:55:40.904 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in completing the
investigation, whether it

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:47.711 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
was from the government, Mario,
or several members of the team.

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:51.949 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But then, something
interesting happened.

00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:57.221 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
On August 18, 2013, the
team, including Konstantin

00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:00.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and Dmitry, were able to
get access to the bodies

00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:05.929 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
to do one final tomography that
was of the highest quality.

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:09.333 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
These CT tomographies
used a special program

00:56:09.333 --> 00:56:11.401 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
that allowed a more
detailed examination

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:15.005 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of each layer of the bodies
in a precise way that

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:20.444 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
would be able to isolate certain
areas for better examination.

00:56:20.444 --> 00:56:23.880 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
&gt;&gt; After we received these
high-resolution images,

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.951 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Professor Galetsky was able
to make very detailed analysis

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:32.756 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of both Maria, big one, and
very important, Josephina,

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:33.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
little creature.

00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:36.827 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
If we talk about Maria,
she's human-like.

00:56:36.827 --> 00:56:41.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
First of all, details of her
skull, anatomy of the skull.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Second, of course,
fingers and toes.

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:49.006 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
So if we go step by step, then,
of course, first the skull.

00:56:49.006 --> 00:56:54.878 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
On the skull, we see
that she has no ears.

00:56:54.878 --> 00:57:00.751 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And construction of her ear
bone's different from us.

00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:04.087 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
This is the first
main conclusion.

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:07.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Then, construction
of skull itself

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
is a little bit different.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
Of course, it is
elongated skull.

00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Maybe not as elongated
as we can see in Paracas,

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:17.968 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
but still, it is elongated.

00:57:17.968 --> 00:57:24.975 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
It is more elongated compared
with our rounded skull.

00:57:24.975 --> 00:57:30.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Second, different
construction of bones of nose.

00:57:30.681 --> 00:57:34.418 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But all other topics of
the skull are very similar.

00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:39.623 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
We don't have a lower
part of the body.

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:46.029 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So neither organs of
reproduction nor liver,

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.964 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
no kidneys.

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:53.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It's strange, but this
came to some conclusions

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:58.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
that maybe she was
attacked by some animal.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:01.945 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And Professor Galetsky
was able to find tracks

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:05.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of claws, fangs on her body.

00:58:05.716 --> 00:58:11.088 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And all this lower part of
the body is just taken away.

00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:15.192 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then we see some
parts of particle

00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:17.828 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
that may be related to blood.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:28.338 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The most interesting
for all of us

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.308 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
was analysis of small bodies.

00:58:31.308 --> 00:58:37.614 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And we had CT scans
of two bodies.

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:41.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And now we know that
there's a male and female.

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:45.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And we had high-resolution
analysis of one of them.

00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:50.127 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Their anatomy construction is
totally different from ours.

00:58:50.127 --> 00:58:56.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
No human beings, no animals have
type of bones that they have.

00:58:56.967 --> 00:59:00.070 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All living creatures,
we have joints.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.239 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
For little creatures,
it's not so.

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:04.741 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's some very
strange construction,

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:09.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
like some balls
of tissues inside.

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:12.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
This allowed them to
have some movements,

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.951 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
but not like ourself.

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:19.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So they were unable to make
like this, but only like this.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
And same as like this.

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:25.629 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So it's clear that their
movement was quite limited.

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:30.634 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Then, construction of their ribs
is, again, totally different

00:59:30.634 --> 00:59:32.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
from any living creatures.

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.471 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Because for all
living creatures,

00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:36.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
we have this central bone.

00:59:36.473 --> 00:59:42.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Their hips are rounded, and
they have no this internal part.

00:59:42.846 --> 00:59:45.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Absolutely different
construction of skull.

00:59:45.849 --> 00:59:48.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And of course, fingers and toes.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:51.721 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
They don't have
mouths, as we do.

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:55.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it's clear that they were
unable to eat hard food.

00:59:55.425 --> 01:00:00.964 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Then, totally different
construction of ears.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:06.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They had ears, but no ears
like we do-- just holes.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:09.206 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And different type of
bones inside the ear.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:10.474 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
There are some bones.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:13.944 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It is-- they are the
same, but different.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:21.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then, they had some
holes on their skull

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:24.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that no living creatures have.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:26.923 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And of course,
it's unclear why do

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they have these type of holes.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:32.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So what was the reason for
nature to have this hole?

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:37.067 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And of course, detailed
analysis in tomography

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.736 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
allowed to see that
it's not construction,

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that it's one subject.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:46.710 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Because when they make
analysis on tomography,

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:51.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
they can make it slide by
slide and see tiny details

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.250 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
on high resolution.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So it's clear that it's not
composed of different parts.

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's one and the same subject.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
From the very beginning,
from the first X-ray,

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:06.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we've seen some rounded subjects
in the belly of Josephina.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:12.002 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But when we had this
detailed CT scan,

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.204 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Professor Galetsky
he was able to make

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:19.209 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
like a slice on the
image of those eggs.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:23.747 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And he demonstrated those
are real eggs, because they

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:27.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have some cover, like any egg.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They have some inside content.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:32.489 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And inside, he
was able to detect

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:35.959 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
the fetus of some creature.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So from one side, it
is Josephina fetus.

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:44.134 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
From outside, it is fetus
of some living creature.

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:47.404 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
&gt;&gt; With all this
evidence and detail,

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
could there be something
in this that suggests,

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:55.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at the very least, a new
species on this planet?

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:06.823 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Finally, on the morning
of November 19, 2018,

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:10.460 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Cusco congressman Armando
Villanueva Mercado

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.430 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
presided over a hearing
about the mummies.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.966 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Scientists whom had
participated in the study

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of the Peruvian mummies
from different countries

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.970 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
were invited.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:24.074 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Every scientist had 15
minutes to present their data.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Several groups presented
tomography analysis

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:30.080 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
describing their
anatomical structure.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.083 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
Three groups presented
results of DNA studies

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.085 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
of different samples.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.420 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All of these groups
worked independently.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.194 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.017 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Focusing on the analysis of
the characteristics of the body

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:11.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
structure not noted by other
researchers, in general,

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.991 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
all came to the conclusion
that the anatomical structure

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:18.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
of all mummies is
different from humans.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:23.333 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Mummies are so complex that any
possibility of counterfeiting

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
is eliminated.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:29.973 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Biologist Ricardo Ringo of
the Mexican company Abraxas

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:33.943 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Biosystems presented the
results of the DNA analysis

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.713 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
of the small mummy, Victoria.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:40.216 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
CEN4GEN Labs from Canada
performed a sample

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
processing and sequencing.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.422 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The fact that it was
possible to extract DNA

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:47.624 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
clearly indicated
that the sample

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:49.959 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
was from biological tissue.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.962 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The same conclusion was made
in the Russian laboratory

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of VS Boronov.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:58.902 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The Canadian laboratory had
a greater amount of material,

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so that they were able
to do better sequencing.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The computerized
analysis of the data

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:09.279 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
showed that this DNA does not
coincide with any human being

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:11.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
or living organisms.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:15.952 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Comparisons were facilitated
with microorganisms, bacteria,

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:20.824 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and animals, such as primates,
crocodiles, and turtles.

01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:23.193 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The conclusion was
that the specimens

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:27.330 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
were an unknown species
of living beings.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.266 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Therefore, the data
from genetic studies,

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the tomography analysis, and
the elementary composition

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:38.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of bodies clearly demonstrated
that the mummies were genuine

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:41.411 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and required more
serious research.

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.913 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
All the groups
worked independently,

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.950 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
using their own
resources and finances.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.819 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The main objective
of this presentations

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:52.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
was to attract the attention
of the Peruvian scientific

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:56.192 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
community and to transfer
the investigation

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:58.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to the official level.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
After the scientific
presentations,

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:04.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
a Peruvian archaeologist
was given the floor.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.470 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
He stated that all
the data presented

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:10.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
was absolutely unacceptable.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
No one knows where
these mummies were found

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and how they were extracted.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
No archaeologist was involved.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.117 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
There was no official
authorization.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:25.755 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
And it is unclear on what
basis all the studies presented

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:26.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
were made.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:31.661 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Who authorized it, and where
were the samples obtained?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
He didn't even want to
consider the results

01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:37.033 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
or that his own
organization wanted nothing

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:42.238 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
to do with the find
from the beginning.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:45.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Other official representatives
of Peruvian science

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.912 align:middle line:85% position:56% size:78%
were not so blatantly negative.

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:52.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The Peruvian archaeologists'
speeches were more neutral,

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:55.051 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but none of them
supported the continuation

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:58.621 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of the investigation
at any level.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.259 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
&gt;&gt; The Ministry of
Culture, until last Friday,

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:06.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
was interested in participating.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.832 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
I went there personally to
talk to the Ministry of Culture

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.633 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:18%
myself.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:14.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But for unknown reasons, they've
backed down from participating.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.340 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
&gt;&gt; After all the
findings were presented,

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.944 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the Peruvian
government went dark.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:23.880 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
There was no verdict
by the government.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Was the evidence too convincing?

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:29.252 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Was there not enough?

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
But then, something
unexpected happened.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:39.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Despite all the backlash
from the anthropologists

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:43.967 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and archaeologists, a university
took interest in the bodies.

01:06:43.967 --> 01:06:48.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
About 190 miles south of
Lima, in the Nazca region,

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:52.876 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
sits the Universidad San Luis
Gonzaga, in the town of Ica.

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:54.744 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
This university
is well known for

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:58.615 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
scientific and technological
studies that will help forward

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:01.651 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the world in changing
times, specifically

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:02.819 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
in the country of Peru.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.557 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Is it possible that
from the research

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:10.994 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
gathered thus far, that the
university saw potential

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:12.962 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to dive deeper?

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:15.031 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The research facility
has all the bodies

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:19.903 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but Josephina, which is
being held back by Mario.

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:22.305 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Mario believes it
has great value

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:25.942 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and refuses to give
it to the universe.

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:31.614 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so the investigation
continues, but in their hands.

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:34.317 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It seems that the evidence
offered by scientists

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:37.620 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
around the world and the
persistence of the crew

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.323 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
sparked an interest with some
of the academic communities

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:43.426 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in Peru that could
not be denied.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.930 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Perhaps it is the
discovery of a new species,

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:49.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
a parting of waters in
the knowledge of what

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
we have of the human race.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:55.972 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Or maybe is it something
completely different?

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:59.008 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The only people that have
tried to find answers

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:02.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
are a group of people committed,
first and foremost, to finding

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:04.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
what might be the truth.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.819 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The journey started with
a quest to give the truth

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:13.289 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to the authorities, and it
ended with the bodies being

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:17.260 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
transferred into a safe and
reliable research facility

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.963 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
for a deeper investigation.

01:08:19.963 --> 01:08:23.633 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
As the university unravels the
truth using high-tech equipment

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:30.740 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and more DNA studies, the world
waits for an official answer.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.912 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
What did Mario really find
in the mountains of Nazca?

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:40.416 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And how has this find
sparked a debate that

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:44.287 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
still refuses to be buried?

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:47.724 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
