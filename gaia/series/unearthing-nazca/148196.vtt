00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:02.211 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
[MELISSA] Today, a new body
has been discovered,

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:05.422 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and so we are going to give
it a CAT scan, X-rayed,

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:06.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and samples taken.

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:10.344 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We're also bringing Maria
back to get another sample,

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:12.304 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and with us today,
is DR. KOROTKOV,

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:13.889 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:33%
the biologist
from Mexico,

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.724 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the forensic scientist 
from Mexico,

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.394 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and also, the rest of our team,
Jaime, and our crew here

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.646 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
from the United States.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.946 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[NARRATOR] Recently, Jaime
Maussan scheduled an appointment

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.824 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with Peru's Ministry of Culture
to request their participation

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.369 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
regarding further investigation
into the mummies

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.411 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
that were discovered.

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:38.664 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
He was met with disappointment.

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Very disappointed.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.675 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
We expected to be treated
by the Ministry of Culture

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
here in Peru.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Unfortunately, they sent someone
from the second or third level

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:59.059 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to tell us that we should
send an email requesting

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
for something like this.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.688 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
They don't have any
interest to cooperate

00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.275 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and to do any kind of
investigation around this case.

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, 
back in Cusco,

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.862 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the team reunites 
with Maria.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.784 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
You see, last time when they
took samples from Maria's body,

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.662 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I would think that it
would be the proof,

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:22.791 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
but first objection that came
to us from other scientists,

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.252 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
other people, 
is it a real body?

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.422 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Okay, no doubts now, real body.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
But then somehow, they attached
three toes and three fingers.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.098 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
They could have taken it from
some bird or from somewhere,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and they just attached it.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That is why I am really happy.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:49.735 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This time, we were able to take
samples directly from finger.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:54.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
From finger, it was possible
to take it from inside

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.491 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
so we didn't damage the body.

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:01.621 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And you can see this because
it's from inside so no doubt,

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.789 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
this is a finger.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now, next step, we make an
analysis of these tissues.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Carbon data.

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:11.548 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
DNA analysis.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:17.054 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And if it matched with analysis
of the body, then it is done.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Then we have it.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:23.268 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
If it's different, then
all the story fell apart.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Was it same DNA trend 
as we have,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and only a little mutation
because the first objection,

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
oh, it's just a mutation?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Or it is different.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.324 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It is different subject,
different species,

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
different creature.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then, of course,
depending on what we have,

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we present in a different way.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:49.002 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So now we are filming how
I extracted the samples.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.506 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So it's no doubt that they are
taken from the different parts.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.134 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
[NARRATOR] Wawita is the most
recent mummy recovered,

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:59.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the team felt that it looked
like a baby version of Maria.

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
First of all, 
we see that this

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.437 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
looked like the same species.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
Looked like.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:14.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Of course, now it's a
preliminary conclusion only.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.198 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And again, we see that
this was some

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.617 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
how prepared specially.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I believe same way as was Maria.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:29.334 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And what's interesting that we
found that to support the head,

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.377 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
they put some wool.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.754 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Absolutely, no doubt.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
You see, they put it--

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.808 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
so it doesn't
belong to the body,

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
but still I will
get this sample.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So just for me, 
it was very strange.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
What it is, it's just
protection for the body.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[JAIME] They did it?

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:56.903 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
[DR. KOROTKOV] Yes, they did it
of course in ancient times.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.867 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
But it has nothing to
do with human tissue.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.786 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
For us, it was very in sync
and important to find out,

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:08.957 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
was it same dating of
the wool as the baby?

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.709 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Or is it different?

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.545 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I don't want to take
samples from the back

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.005 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
because it would damage it.

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
Maybe from the bottom.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You can keep it in your hands.

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Upside down. Be careful.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.375 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
That's important that I
was able to take a sample

00:04:52.375 --> 00:05:00.258 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
from the baby because 
it was bone, little bone.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:04.054 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Because it's a solid bone
and it is much easier

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to make analysis 
of solid bone compared

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
with just soft tissues.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.394 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then, again, it gives
us a very clear answer,

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:15.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
what is the dating
of this sample?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.318 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
What is the DNA analysis 
of this sample

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
because I have no doubt it is
part of being, a little being.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:29.871 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And then, again, was it 
matched with Maria?

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Or is it different?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Even if it's different,
then it's understandable.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.755 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But then, again, the question
was it, male or female?

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
What's the construction of the--

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:41.841 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
what's the genes?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.094 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
What's the DNA construction,
the genome?

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So it will give us 
a lot of information.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[NARRATOR] Next, the team 
brings Wawita for X-ray imaging.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It was in the face down, 
fetal position

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.612 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
so the team discusses
the best angle

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to image the body with X-rays.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.121 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The team focused on comparing
this X-ray to Maria's.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.331 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Because the body
was so compressed,

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:16.084 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
it was difficult to
examine the details

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.836 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
so they focused on the hands.

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:20.505 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
More or less, it's
the same pattern.

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.799 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Obviously here, 
with a greater separation,

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.634 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
being that it is an infant.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.345 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
There is a bigger separation.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:31.266 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The bones are shorter, but
it meets the pattern of five

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:34.978 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
in the palm, in the carpal, and
it divides to three fingers.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:43.778 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
In doing a comparative analysis
with a normal human being,

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.239 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
does it match the
same bones of carpal?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
No, these are too cylindrical.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It has three fingers, 
but with five metacarpals.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.125 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
[DR. KOROTKOV] From my glance, 
of course I'm not a professional

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.169 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
so I don't want to make any
professional conclusions,

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:03.048 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
but from the first glance,
they were the same construction

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.466 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:33%
as our bones.

00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:09.262 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The same two bones in
every part of the body.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.265 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So that's why it would
be confirmation

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
that it's the same
species of Maria.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.065 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
[NARRATOR] Coming up, 
further examination of Wawita.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
[DR. KOROTKOV] I am looking
forward more to CAT scan.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Because from CAT scan, we've
seen construction of bones.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.698 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[NARRATOR] Plus, updates 
from the samples taken.
