had some kind of power tools

and engineering capabilities
much like we have today.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the machining of
these perfectly spherical stone

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%

difficult it could really only

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
be done with power tools.

these megalithic stone

purpose was of these balls

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%

were constructed.

It probably weighs several tons,
possibly even up to 10 tons.

It's been carved out
of a very hard granite.

But once again, the
purpose of these balls

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and even how they were
made remains a mystery

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
to archeologists.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
One of the theories
on Atlantis is

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was, around 10,000
BC, a worldwide civilization,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
a maritime civilization.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
They left their capital city
of Atlantis, and in the ships,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
went all over the world,
going to the Americas,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to Africa, to Europe,
and to all continents.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
mysteries of Atlantis

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:90%
is these giant stone balls.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
These giant granite
balls are often

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
associated with the Atlanteans.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
They're found on
many continents,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
especially here in
Central America.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
But these giant stone balls
have been found in Malta.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
They've been found on remote
islands such as Easter Island.

round stone balls like this.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Another big question with
these giant stone balls

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
is what they were for.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's baffling to archeologists.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Why anyone would go through
considerable effort,

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
even if they had power tools,
to make these giant stone balls.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean what is the point?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Today, mainstream
archeologists are just

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
grasping at straws for
some kind of explanation.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Their main explanation
right now is

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that these giant stone
balls-- and some of them

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
are relatively small, only
the size of a basketball

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit bigger.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.776 align:middle line:84%
While others are five,
six feet in diameter--

00:06:32.776 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
that they are some kind
of ceremonial object.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have found some
of the smaller stone balls

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:90%
in tombs in Costa Rica.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's like important chiefs,
or kings, or shamans were

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:90%
buried with these stone balls--

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
generally the small ones.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But still, it doesn't
really explain what

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.165 align:middle line:90%
these stone balls were for.

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's my theory that
these stone balls

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that are found in the
tombs and burials of some

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
of these important people
in ancient Costa Rica,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't know what
these balls were for either.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And that these balls are many,
many thousands of years old.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
They apparently washed up
like by some tidal wave

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that hit the southwest
coast of Costa Rica.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
washed these balls up

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
into mountain jungle areas,
onto one of the islands that's

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.392 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of Costa Rica.

00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The ancient people
of Costa Rica,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
who are then using
these balls as some kind

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of ceremonial object,
didn't actually

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
build them or
machine these balls.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
They're finding them
in the jungle thinking

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
they are some kind
of eggs of the gods

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
or giant stone
balls of the gods.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the small ones,
just because they're

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
some oddball important object,
are buried with these chiefs.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
make these balls.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:90%
They were already there.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask yourself,
who made these balls,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:90%
and what was their function?

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
This is something that we
really haven't figured out.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%

from many thousands of years

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and other megalith areas
of Peru and Bolivia,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
were a similar people as to
those in Central America,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
including perhaps
the Olmecs, who

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
were building the
colossal basalt

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.340 align:middle line:84%
heads and other giant
megalithic artifacts

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:90%
that we can find there.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And they, with their
machine tools--

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and I believe the Olmecs
had machining tools,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
as were used in Egypt, as were
used in Peru, and Bolivia,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and other areas of the world.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
this that they were

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:90%
making these giant stone balls.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We still don't know
exactly what they're for.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Theories say that they were
possibly used by navigators.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that by placing these stone
balls in positions together,

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
were showing where
islands were for people

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:84%
who were crossing the Pacific,
or crossing the Atlantic,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and in transoceanic
trading expeditions,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's one idea, that these
huge stone balls were all part

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:90%
of an elaborate map system.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps too, they
were showing where

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
stars were and constellations.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, that's a
pretty interesting theory.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
However, I don't think it
explains the really, really

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
large stone balls very
well, because they

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:90%
are so huge and so heavy.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been so
difficult to make those.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it would have
been a lot of extra effort

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that would be quite
unnecessary if you're just

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to create star
maps and navigation

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:90%
maps of islands and things.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't need a giant stone
balls for that in my mind.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Today, these balls from the
swamps of southwestern Costa

One of the problems with the

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%

we're in a very

One of the other

that we discovered in
Costa Rica is their use

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:90%
of tattooing and stamps.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the various
Indians in Costa Rica

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
had all sorts of fancy
textiles and body painting,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.140 align:middle line:84%
as well as tattooing
with charcoal and parts

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:90%
of their own blood.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
This was used, of course,
in all the Pacific Islands.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It was also used
in Southeast Asia,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and in Arabia, and
among the Egyptians.

De Oviedo, they

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.380 align:middle line:84%
talk about the type
of tattooing that they

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
were doing in Costa Rica.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
have their arms painted

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%

On page 94, they show a gold
pendant found in Panama.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It's thought to be several
thousand years old.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And it has a gem inlaid in it.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It's about 4 and
1/2 inches long.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be a
zoomorphic pendant of some kind

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:90%
of heavy machinery.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it, it has what
looks like a backhoe coming out

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of the back.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:90%
It's got blades in the back.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
In the front it has a skid
plate and other things.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be really
a monster that was really

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:90%
some kind of heavy machinery.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
to have electricity,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
to have iron and other
very strong metals,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:84%
this would naturally
lead to power tools,

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to heavy machinery, and
ultimately, even in a sense,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
to flight.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
With this pendant being made
out of gold and an unknown gem

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in the center of it, is
that gold is indestructible.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
All the gold that exists
from ancient times

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
still exists today in
the form of jewelry,

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%
in ingots, in coins of gold.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Gold itself was very
valuable to the ancients.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:90%
And it can't be destroyed.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't rust and
oxidize like other metals.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:90%
But there's a problem with gold.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Gold is really too soft to
work in machines and things.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Gold can be used in
electrical devices.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise it's best
used just as jewelry.

You know, there's a lot that
you don't know about the banana.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The banana is, in
fact, a seedless fruit,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
a fruit that seems to be
genetically engineered

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
in remote antiquity to
be a seedless plant,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
like a seedless grape
or a seedless orange.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Bananas exist all over the
world, even on remote islands.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Bananas are one
of the few fruits

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that you can live
completely on, with protein,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and carbohydrates, and
vitamins, and other minerals.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Bananas are the
world's tallest grass.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But grass is normally
reproduced by seeds

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and by tubers in their roots.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The banana, however, is unusual
in that the banana is only

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
able to reproduce
through its roots

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and through shoots and tubers,
not through the actual fruit

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there's an
indication that some time

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
in remote antiquity, the banana
was genetically engineered

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:90%
to be a seedless fruit.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.494 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was engineered in
what we like to call Atlantis.

in that country.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And on that island
have been found

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
dozens of strange
megalithic statues

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%

Lake Nicaragua is a huge
lake the size of Puerto Rico.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, early
Spanish explorers,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
when they first
arrived in Nicaragua,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:84%
thought that Lake Nicaragua
was part of the ocean.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Lake
Nicaragua was probably

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:90%
part of the ocean at one time.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And that lake has the
only freshwater sharks

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:90%
that are known.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And these sharks live
in Lake Nicaragua.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, that lake
had to be a saltwater lake that

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:90%
was connected to the ocean.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But over time, it became
a freshwater lake.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sharks, over time,
adapted to the freshwater.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We decided to journey
out to Zapatera Island.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And as we proceeded
from the harbor,

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
we were going through a series
of small little islands.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's 365
of these small islands.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And so we were protected.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But once we got out into the
open water of Lake Nicaragua,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:90%
the weather suddenly turned bad.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:90%
We were pelted by rainstorms.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Big waves came up on the lake.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't realize just
how dangerous this journey

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:90%
was going to be.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, on that very same
day, two American missionaries

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%

in the storms that

unusual head ornament.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And down here near the base
is a very finely carved cross,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
very much thought of
as a European symbol.

kind of serpent, perhaps a sea

head and his ear.

head with the teeth here,

what's called tenons

at the top for other
pillar pieces to fit.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And this piece is
especially unusual

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
because this stone
has a dual purpose.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
One purpose is as a section of
a pillar to hold up a temple.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But it also has a metallic
mold carved into it.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And this mold would have
been used apparently

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
for making ax heads or even
possibly keystone clamps.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:36.060 align:middle line:84%

metals would be poured

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:90%
into these hourglass shapes.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
We see a channel for the
metal to come through and pour

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:48.276 align:middle line:84%
a second ax head,
an hourglass shape.

00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly been used for some
kind of metal manufacturing.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
This itself is curious
because it indicates

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%

was going on here on Lake

were farther north.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.790 align:middle line:84%
In my book, "The
Mystery of the Olmecs,"

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I discuss much of the history
and how many of the giant

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:90%
statues were found.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the most
famous Olmec statues,

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:84%
which was discovered in
1945 at San Lorenzo, which

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:02.970 align:middle line:84%
is near to Veracruz along
the Gulf Coast of Mexico,

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:06.950 align:middle line:84%
this giant basalt
head was completely

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:13.080 align:middle line:84%
buried in the ground, as were
almost all of these huge heads.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And people were walking over it.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And a trail happened
to just pass over

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:22.780 align:middle line:84%
the forehead of this
giant buried head.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
archeologists realized

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, this rock that
was just exposed on this trail

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:37.130 align:middle line:84%
was part of this huge and
beautifully carved Olmec head.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, like many
of the giant Olmec heads,

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:90%
it looks very African.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.240 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
the heads, we see

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that not only are they
colossal, weighing many tons,

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:84%
but the facial
features seem to not

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:57.780 align:middle line:84%
be American Indian
but more African,

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:02.520 align:middle line:84%
with the wide nose,
and the thick lips.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.970 align:middle line:84%
They're wearing some
kind of leather helmet.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They have the stern
expressions of warriors.

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.065 align:middle line:84%
Many Olmec statues have a
trademark frown on their face.

00:50:14.065 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.460 align:middle line:84%
All of these features
puzzle archeologists.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
mysteries of the Olmecs.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.230 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be
Negroes from Africa.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have thick
beards and mustaches

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and appear to be Caucasians
from the eastern Mediterranean.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Other Olmecs seem very Oriental
and Chinese in their look.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that thousands
of years ago in southern Mexico

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and Guatemala and Honduras
that this area was

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:53.960 align:middle line:84%
some kind of trading zone
where ships and seafarers came

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.840 align:middle line:84%
across the Atlantic,
across the Pacific,

00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:90%
meeting in Central America.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And this early culture is
known today as the Olmecs.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.470 align:middle line:84%
With some of these
colossal heads,

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:11.840 align:middle line:84%
they are intricately
carved out of basalt,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.470 align:middle line:90%
which is extremely hard stone.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And carving these basalt heads,
in my mind, would have required

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.740 align:middle line:84%
some pretty advanced technology
and tools, including, I think,

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:90%
power tools.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
the colossal heads

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:39.400 align:middle line:84%
from San Lorenzo was very
interesting and unique because

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:84%
it was a 20-ton basalt
head, but along parts

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of the top of the helmet are
all these strange pockmarks

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and circular grooves in it.

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, archeologists
have wondered

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.190 align:middle line:84%
about these strange
pockmarks on this head

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's like after it had
been carved as a complete stone

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:15.360 align:middle line:84%
head, someone then took
what was a power tool

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and was basically
dishing out parts

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of the head with this power
tool in an effort to deface it.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And this has baffled
archeologists

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:84%
One, they don't know
why someone would

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.360 align:middle line:84%
try to deface this basalt
head with these pockmarks.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And they can't figure
out how these marks would

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
have been made on the head
because, in their mind,

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.210 align:middle line:84%
the Olmecs were
primitive people.

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.590 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
knowledge of the wheel.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they didn't
have power tools.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But how they could have bashed
out these little circular

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.870 align:middle line:84%
pockmarks, they
can't figure out.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they have
all of the indications

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.880 align:middle line:84%
of being some kind
of a power tool

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that was dishing out these
little circular holes

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.250 align:middle line:90%
on this basalt head.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:16.150 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The Olmecs were also known
for cranial deformation.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They were, as I
sometimes call them,

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:40.640 align:middle line:84%
cone heads, like in South
America and other areas

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.950 align:middle line:84%
of the world like Malta, the
Kurds, the [INAUDIBLE] in Egypt

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:50.600 align:middle line:84%
like Akhenaten and Nefertiti,
and their children all

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.580 align:middle line:90%
also had elongated craniums.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:57.520 align:middle line:84%
This was done also,
apparently, in ancient China.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It was done on remote
Pacific Islands like Vanuatu.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.760 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Olmecs are
particularly well known

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.050 align:middle line:84%
for having these
deformed cranium.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:15.480 align:middle line:84%
What the purpose of
that was we don't know.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people had
crania that was twice

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:26.900 align:middle line:90%
the size of our own heads.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:28.600 align:middle line:90%
How were they doing this?

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that,
apparently, they

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.910 align:middle line:84%
did it was they
took a baby's head

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and the plates in your
head haven't fused yet

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:44.640 align:middle line:90%
when you're a small baby.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And by binding the head, you're
able to elongate the skull

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:90%
and essentially deform it.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people had their
heads flattened and very wide.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Others had their heads
extremely elongated

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:09.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they were narrow and
came to a top, as a conehead.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why
people did this.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But it was a practice
used throughout the world

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and is quite unusual.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Just cranial deformation
in itself is, in some way,

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.946 align:middle line:84%
evidence for ocean going
travel, trans-Pacific,

00:55:30.946 --> 00:55:35.230 align:middle line:84%
trans-Atlantic
kind of voyager's.

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The idea that people in Africa,
and the Middle East, and China,

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and remote Pacific
islands, and in Mexico,

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and South America, even
the Chinook Indians

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:84%
all did this separately
and invented it separately,

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:57.530 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't seem right.

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is something that
people had to learn culturally.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is, to say the
least, highly unusual.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Notice here, on
this Olmec statue,

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:15.740 align:middle line:84%
he's wearing a top knot on
his head, which may have

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.550 align:middle line:90%
been the way he wore his hair.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We find this curious
topknot on the head

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:27.580 align:middle line:84%
is also found in the
statues of Easter Island.

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:33.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the really strange
statues in the museum

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:36.670 align:middle line:84%
is the statue that
looks very Egyptian.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Notice that he is
apparently wearing the false

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:42.830 align:middle line:84%
beard that we associate
so much with the pharaohs.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Other parts of his
head, too, seem

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to be Egyptian-type pharaonic
headdress that he's wearing.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:57:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Looking at this
sculpture, you might

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.320 align:middle line:84%
think you were in a
museum in Cairo, Egypt.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Notice here again how his
hands are on his knees.

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.940 align:middle line:84%
This is known as the
[INAUDIBLE] position.

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.110 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing an
unusual headdress

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.740 align:middle line:90%
with the ball in front.

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that there
was a snake here too.

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.910 align:middle line:84%
This altar would have
been very Egyptian.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:28.330 align:middle line:84%
His headdress as well
is very Egyptian.

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fine and
well made statue.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Some Olmec statues are
extremely unusual, even

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:41.210 align:middle line:84%
abstract in their nature,
something you might

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:90%
find in a modern art museum.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:47.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things about the Olmecs

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:52.050 align:middle line:84%
too is that their
core area is known

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:54.600 align:middle line:90%
as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.070 align:middle line:10%
And the isthmus of Tehuantepec
is that narrow part

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:03.220 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico in the very south.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's where Mexico
is at its narrowest,

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:12.450 align:middle line:84%
between the Atlantic Ocean
and the Pacific Ocean.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this is the
core area of the Olmecs.

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Olmecs were
really on both coasts.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:25.840 align:middle line:84%
They were on the Atlantic
Coast and on the Pacific coast.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So the Olmecs could have had
ultimately ports on two oceans.

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:84%
This Isthmus of
Tehuantepec too has

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:41.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot in common with today's
current Panama Canal.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Back in the 1800s, when
the Panama Canal was first

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:48.940 align:middle line:84%
being conceived,
there were three areas

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in Central America that
were being considered

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to try and create a transit
zone between the Atlantic

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and the Pacific.

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Panama was, of course,
being considered

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because it had a series of
lakes and was a narrow area.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Nicaragua was also being
considered for this

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:15.450 align:middle line:84%
because boats could
come from the Atlantic

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:19.420 align:middle line:84%
into Lake Nicaragua and they
could get very, very close

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.470 align:middle line:90%
to the Pacific Ocean.

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:24.840 align:middle line:84%
However, there was still a
narrow but high mountain range

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.370 align:middle line:84%
that's separating Lake
Nicaragua with the Pacific.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.640 align:middle line:84%
The third area
that was considered

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:84%
was the isthmus of
Tehuantepec in Mexico.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And what the Mexican
government ultimately did

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:44.390 align:middle line:84%
was build a railroad between
the Atlantic and the Pacific

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.080 align:middle line:90%
to bridge this narrow area.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of curious
because the Olmecs themselves

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:57.515 align:middle line:84%
had already realized that,
yeah, this area was--

00:59:57.515 --> 01:00:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the Tehuantepec
isthmus in Mexico

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:08.370 align:middle line:84%
was an area where you could
have ports on the Pacific

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.010 align:middle line:90%
and ports on the Atlantic.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And right in the
middle of that area

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
was the early megalithic
cities in Mexico,

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.420 align:middle line:90%
such as Monte Alban and Mitla.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And these areas too were part
of the heartland of the Olmecs

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately became
Mixtec and Zapotec cities.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's another example of
the very unusual Olmec art

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and style.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:38.040 align:middle line:90%
It's very distinct.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But the stylization is so
unique, almost futuristic.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It's thought that the
Olmecs were the mother

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
culture of Mesoamerica.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
As archeologists
studied the Olmecs,

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
they realized that many of the
things that had been previously

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.930 align:middle line:84%
ascribed to the
Mayans having invented

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
had really been invented
by the Olmecs before them.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about the
Mayan calendar, the number

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
system, the hieroglyphic
system, even the building

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of early Mayan pyramids such
as the ones at Uaxactun,

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.410 align:middle line:90%
north of Tikal.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
All of these things really
began with the Olmecs.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Mayans
who essentially inherited

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
all of this scientific
knowledge that ultimately

01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.490 align:middle line:90%
came from the Olmecs.

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Year after year, archeologists
discover new things

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
about the Olmecs, pushing
them farther back in time

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and deeper into the
heart of Mexico.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Only recently archeologists have
discovered the oldest writing

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.330 align:middle line:90%
in the Americas, which is Olmec.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Also they've discovered Olmec
remains near Mexico City.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
What caused the collapse of
this great early civilization?

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.592 align:middle line:84%
We may never know the
secrets of the Olmecs.

Next we'll be continuing
our adventures in Mexico,

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
going to the Great Pyramid
of Cholula in central Mexico

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and to the enigmatic pyramids
of Teotihuacan and Tula.

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And then north over the border
into Arizona and New Mexico

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to look for the lost cities
and ancient mysteries

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.760 align:middle line:90%
of the southwest.
