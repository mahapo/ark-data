00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's theorized,
you know, by some people

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that these scoops were used
in the construction of, like,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
ramming poles and stuff
in here to hold up

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
blocks while they're, you know,
carefully chiselling them out.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet, not all the
blocks have that.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Only some.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And others, rather than having
scoops, have knobs instead.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Like there you can see a
couple of knob up there.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that these scoops
and knobs were somehow used

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:90%
in the handling of the blocks.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But, again, exactly how
they would have done it,

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:90%
it's a mystery.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's thought that
it was just brute force.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange things,
too, with blocks like this

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
is that in the traditional
idea that they're constantly

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
chiseling away to
make it perfect,

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
but that meant moving the
blocks away, chiseling

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
it a little bit, putting
it back, seeing how it fit,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
moving it again, chipping
it more, putting it back.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And this constant
trial and error

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.224 align:middle line:84%
of trying to get the
blocks to fit right.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really one
of the great mysteries

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of how they were such
incredible stonemasons that they

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
would just make all of
the blocks fit perfectly.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was definitely
part of their technique

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.836 align:middle line:84%
that this perfect fitting
was very much their style,

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and they just weren't going
to do it any other way.

In fact, they came
from this mountain

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
river that's many miles away.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The quarry on this
mountain up here

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
is massive blocks
of granite that

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
have come down from
the mountain almost

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
like they have been blasted
off of this granite mountain.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are squared
higher up in the mountain,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.815 align:middle line:84%
and then brought by trails
down for many miles.

00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
to cross the river,

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:84%
then come back up
this mountain here

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
at The Sun Temple
of Ollantaytambo,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.771 align:middle line:90%
and then are put into place.

00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
This is an engineering
feat that is perhaps

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:90%
unequaled in mankind--

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:84%
bringing massive blocks
of granite many miles

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and across a river,
up another mountain,

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and then perfectly placed
where we see them today.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It's almost a superhuman effort.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:84%
This block is
particularly interesting

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
because it has what we
call keystone cuts on it.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Keystone cuts are these
T-shaped cuts in the stone.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then another stone
is fitted against this

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:84%
with a corresponding
T-shaped cut.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And then a copper clamp,
or some other metal,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is poured into these
grooves forming

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:90%
what's called a keystone cut.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We find these unusual
keystone cuts also

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
at Tiahuanaco in Bolivia, which
is an, admittedly, pre-Inca

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We also find keystone cuts
like this in ancient Egypt,

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Turkey,
in ancient Greece,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.120 align:middle line:90%
and in other parts of the world.

>>But when you're talking
about a later culture

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
coming in and working
with these blocks,

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:90%
that's the technology they had.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Very, very small elements.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.929 align:middle line:90%
Easy to handle.

00:24:40.929 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you see it today.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
build their houses.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>That's right.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, that's
part of the point

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:84%
here is that someone
was able to build

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.456 align:middle line:90%
with giant blocks of stone.

wasn't hard for them.

the Incas doing that.

if the lower part is Inca,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%

was originally

we really have no idea.

that's been cut into this block.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, naturally,
another giant block

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
would have been
fitted against it

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.107 align:middle line:84%
with a corresponding
keystone cut on this side.

00:26:13.107 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
This wall right here at The
Sun Temple of Ollantaytambo

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:90%
is actually extremely important.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You see these quite large
blocks of andesite here.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
You see the poor construction
of filler right here.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the Inca construction.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, we
see this keystone cut here

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:90%
on this block.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We only have one half
of a keystone cut.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is extremely
important, because there's

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
no way that the original
builders of this wall

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.180 align:middle line:84%
would ever have cut
a keystone cut here

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and not have another
wall attached

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to it with a corresponding
keystone cut.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this block had
to have originally have been

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
horizontal, because a
keystone cut cannot be poured

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
on a vertical block like this.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely clear to
me that this wall itself

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
has been destroyed
and reconstructed, all

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
in prehistory
before the Spanish.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Probably, the builders who
reconstructed this wall

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:90%
were even pre-Inca themselves.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And later, the Incas
came in and filled

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.821 align:middle line:84%
in with this mud, mortar
construction we see here.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this wall right here is
one of the most perfect walls.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.965 align:middle line:84%
It's very famous here
at Ollantaytambo.

00:28:05.965 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of the
polygonal jigsaw cutting

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.651 align:middle line:90%
and fitting of the blocks.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
for this is it

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
provides more surface area for
the blocks to lock in together

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and creates a great
deal more stability

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
for these gigantic walls.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to wonder, too,
why they wanted this.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:36.625 align:middle line:84%
They clearly, as they
built such walls like this,

00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
this was important
to them that they

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:84%
had these little
notches and corners that

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:90%
were fitting in together.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It was to keep them
from being uniform,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and by providing
extra surface area,

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
the blocks held
together better during

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.015 align:middle line:84%
the many Andean earthquakes
that are so severe.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
This great doorway here
is also quite interesting.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It's built out of quite
large blocks of granite

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:90%
weighing many tens of tons.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then here you
see the articulation

of the blocks coming in,
very uniform, coming down

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:90%

Well, to get a corner
radius like this,

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you would have to use a tool has
a dimension of 5/8 of an inch,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.460 align:middle line:84%
because what we have
is a 5/16s radius.

were working with stone

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:84%
to create these artifacts,
the work that it would take

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to actually go from a larger
radius, which obviously you

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
would have to use a
larger tool to start with

this smaller radius,

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:84%

It's one of the smaller

but it still weighs many tons.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have to wonder
why would the Incas,

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:84%
or even the pre-Inca,
a stonemasons,

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:84%
want to come up here
on top of this mountain

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and then quarry these
hundred-ton, 200-ton, 500-ton

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:28.650 align:middle line:84%
blocks of granite, and then

drag them miles down this
mountain across a river

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.044 align:middle line:84%
and then up the mountain on the
other side to The Sun Temple?

00:37:38.044 --> 00:37:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it makes
you think, could it

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:84%
have been actually easy
for them to do this rather

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%

They're trying to separate
this part of the rock.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:84%
This giant block right here has

why would they go

through such difficult process?

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:84%

Some archaeologists
actually believe

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that the Incas never really
knew about Machu Picchu either,

Machu Picchu is pre-Inca.

two different styles

That's for sure.

wanted to show you is that,

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:22.190 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's definitely
a pre-Inca, megalithic,

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:84%
perfect-fitting type
construction and then a later

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.755 align:middle line:90%
construction that's--

00:50:26.755 --> 00:50:27.605 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:50:27.605 --> 00:50:33.650 align:middle line:84%

in construction, really.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.330 align:middle line:84%

example of different levels

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Here you see an earlier level
of megalithic construction.

as some of the other things.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.106 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is
then the second level

00:50:48.106 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:90%

But once you get
up to this level

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.340 align:middle line:84%
here and right above
the door, you're

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.660 align:middle line:84%

poor construction.

Inca construction up here.

pre-Inca construction.

even pretend to get that flat.

it's just not flat.

This could have easily
been made by the Incas,

although it's a pretty
impressive bit of engineering.

Now, if you'll look at the
buildings in this royal section

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of Pisac, you'll notice
that the stonework

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:36.510 align:middle line:90%
is very good stonework.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
this one building

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that is here kind of in the
middle which is obviously

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.940 align:middle line:90%
of inferior stonework.

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, mainstream
archaeologists are

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:51.500 align:middle line:84%
saying that this inferior
building is the oldest

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.510 align:middle line:90%
building within this complex.

00:59:54.510 --> 01:00:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And, naturally then, the fine
stonework building came later.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is
exactly the opposite.

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That building with
the inferior stonework

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.400 align:middle line:84%
is clearly the latest
building in this complex.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It was built by the Incas,
while the other finer

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.710 align:middle line:90%
stonework is much older.

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:18.440 align:middle line:90%
And is, in fact, pre-Inca.

The walls here at Pisac

Notice the large lichen
patches that we see.

possibly even in pre-Inca times.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
These wells here are also
extremely well-made, fitted

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.150 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:09.519 align:middle line:90%

this building here,

you can clearly see that it's
of inferior stone masonry.

Most archaeologists
today are saying

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.935 align:middle line:84%
that this is the oldest
building at Pisac

01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%

fine megalithic stones what

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.440 align:middle line:90%

In my mind, this
theory is wrong.

this building here

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
with the inferior stonework
is the latest building here

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
at Pisac, and it was
probably built by the Incas.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.010 align:middle line:90%
looked in ancient times.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%

This megalithic tower is

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Some think that it was
used as a burial tower.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Others think that it
was an acoustic machine

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and that wind blowing across
the tops of these towers

01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
created a constant

This rather unique stone

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
for archaeoastronomical nominal

other walls were somehow
connected to this.

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that giant

into this giant door.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.460 align:middle line:90%
But we really don't know.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things about this door,

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
too, is that it's
essentially a false door,

What Jose is saying is
that the different legends

are one is that
this is a star gate,

01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
a gate to other dimensions.

is that this is

and to the right of it is
the Island of the Moon.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
According to
ancient Inca legend,

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:15.190 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
first Incas appeared.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%

and also other brothers
and sisters of them,

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
they magically appeared
on the Island of the Sun,

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
allegedly coming through
tunnels underneath the lake.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, legend
says that there

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was a tunnel beneath
the lake that

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
connects the Island of the Sun
and the Island of the Moon.

So after being Incas
had first appeared

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
on the Island of the Sun
and the Island of the Moon,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
they then came ashore
here on Lake Titicaca

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to tell the people
who lived around

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
here the Aymaras, the Coyas, the
Wari, that they had been sent

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
from the Sun God to civilize
them, to build Cusco,

01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and to build a great
Empire of the Sun.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the mysteries
of the Incas

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the time period
of them is actually

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%
very near to the conquest.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
When the first
Inca, Manco Capac,

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
allegedly appeared on
the Island of the Sun,

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.830 align:middle line:90%
the year only about 1100 AD.

01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
In the next 400 years, suddenly
the great Inca Empire appeared,

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and many archaeologists say
that Cusco and Sacsaywaman,

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Ollantaytambo, Machu
Picchu, and other areas

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.170 align:middle line:84%
were all built during
this period of time.

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's a mystery
here, because all

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
around Lake Titicaca are
pre-Inca such as Tiahuanaco.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
These buildings were
megalithic in scope.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.620 align:middle line:90%
They had keystone cuts.

They were giant granite
buildings and pyramids.

a lot of the surface

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.340 align:middle line:90%
that we see on the stone.

01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.760 align:middle line:84%
What I see indicates to me that
this was cut with a machine,

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and the tool just plowed
through the material.

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't need
to be polished,

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
but it is certainly
very precise.

01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:19.420 align:middle line:90%


01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've taken measurements
between the holes

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to the edge of the stone to
see what the distance is.

01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken a measurement
between each hole

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
where I've been able to-
some areas have been broken.

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I've been unable to measure.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But essentially it's running
between 2.605 two 2.616.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So considering that I'm really
measuring the start of a groove

01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to an edge that is
kind of broke in a way,

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that's within
ten-thousandths of an inch.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I should imagine
that statistically

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.103 align:middle line:84%
that would be perfectly
straight with that edge.

speaks of a high technology.

>>Yeah.

01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think we've found
the holy grail here.

01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
What this indicates to
me is that this piece

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:13.210 align:middle line:90%
was put on a machine.

01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It was planed on one side.

01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And using this surface
as a reference,

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
this groove was cut at a precise
dimension from this surface.

01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
There is no way that this groove
could have been created just

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
by chiseling it out, or
even rubbing it out using

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
a piece of bone or sand.

01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to do that and
achieve the characteristics

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have,
because what we would

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
find, if this was done by
hand and painstakingly slow

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
using bone and sand, you would
find a very smooth surface

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.890 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the groove.

01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But we don't find
a smooth surface

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.420 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the groove.

01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
tool went through that

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and just plowed
through the material.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.745 align:middle line:84%
And the variations
that we see are

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
natural to any
manufacturing process.

>>So are you also saying that
to create a block like this

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
you would have to have

01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
metal tools with diamond
saws and things like that?

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>Yes.

01:30:34.230 --> 01:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
What I think, David,
we have to remember

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
civilization that suffered

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.400 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous cataclysm.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
The whole culture was
totally wiped out.

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And everything that supported
the infrastructure, that

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:55.480 align:middle line:84%
supported the building of
this, disappeared long ago.

01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It could be, actually, under our
feet over there or over there.

01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:02.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's obvious that
this particular site

01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:11.060 align:middle line:84%
has been covered over by
huge mudslides, an uplift

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
of the plates of the earth,
a tremendous cataclysm that

01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the civilisation
that created this.

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.040 align:middle line:90%


01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.256 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your
opinion, do you think

01:31:23.256 --> 01:31:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that the same civilization that
was creating what we see here

01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:34.350 align:middle line:84%
at Tiahuanaco also made what we
saw at Ollantaytambo in Peru?

01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>I strongly believe that, yes.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>So you would say then
that Ollantaytambo was not

01:31:40.150 --> 01:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
built by the Incas, but was
built by the same people who

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:43.840 align:middle line:90%
built Tiahuanaco?
