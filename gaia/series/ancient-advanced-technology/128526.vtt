00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>There are three
cities in Peru that

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
were inhabited in Inca times
that are still inhabited today.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Cusco is one of them.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Another city that was
inhabited in Inca times,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and is still inhabited today,
is a town called Choquechaca,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
which means gold storage.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is a small town
way in the mountains.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
The third town that was
inhabited in Inca times

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and is still inhabited today
is this town, Ollantaytambo.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Ollantaytambo's a
very special town.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a megalithic town.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was built many
thousands of years ago.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It has many great
doorways and super walls.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Follow me, and
we'll explore some

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
of the alleys of Ollantaytambo.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.311 align:middle line:90%

Check out some of these huge
cornerstone blocks here.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Truly megalithic
city, Ollantaytambo.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you see some really well
constructed megalithic doorways

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
here at the village
of Ollantaytambo.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And like in Inca times, water
flowed down the streets just

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:90%
like here.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And every street, in
fact, in Ollantaytambo

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
had man-made
streams flowing down

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
either along the
side of the street

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:90%
or in the middle of the street.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:90%

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We've hiked up the terraces
to nearly the top of the Sun

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Temple here at Ollantaytambo.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's this section
where we start

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to see the awesome megalithic
stones, some of them weighing

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.556 align:middle line:90%
100 tons or more.

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
An earlier episode on ancient
technology in Peru and Bolivia,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we showed how the
builders of Ollantaytambo

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
were the same builders
who built Tiahuanaco.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was because
of the keystone cuts

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that are found both at
Tiahuanaco and Pumapunku

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:90%
and here at Ollantaytambo.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So we've returned here
to Ollantaytambo in Peru

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to look at more evidence
of ancient technology.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So follow me through
this ancient fortress

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.105 align:middle line:84%
to look at the incredible
evidence for ancient machining.

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So here at the top
of the Sun Temple

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:90%
is the famous megalithic wall.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And all around us
are giant blocks

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:90%
of red granite, andesite.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They've been hewn from a quarry
up on this mountain many miles

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
away, and somehow
dragged across the river

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
and then up on top of this hill.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the builders never
finished their construction,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and these giant 100-ton
blocks are still

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
lying here unfinished,
and they haven't been

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:90%
put into their final place.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Something happened here that
stopped their construction,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
some cataclysm, some
end of a civilization

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
where the builders just
abandoned their work.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.264 align:middle line:84%
And what we see left are these
giant stones scattered around

00:06:57.264 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:90%
here at Ollantaytambo.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
As we come around here on the
east side of the Sun Temple,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
again, we see the
large granite blocks.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But then we see the crummy
filler blocks with mud.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Another giant block.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the largest.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It has these unusual
knobs coming out,

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
what that's for.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
This block too is notched here
for another gigantic granite

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
block to be fitted,
but it's not here.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we have these
crummy filler blocks.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
This is really
Inca construction.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And what was meant to be here
originally, and probably was,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
were other big blocks
of perfectly cut granite

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
fitted into this
notch, coming down here

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in a narrow piece of
finely cut granite.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what we see.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we see this crummy
Inca construction filler.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
More of it here and here.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the Inca construction,
but these giant blocks

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
are the pre-Inca, megalithic
builders' construction.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:84%
This is the same people who
built Tiahuanaco and Pumapunku.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
We can really see
here at Ollantaytambo

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
how Machu Picchu and Saqsaywaman
and Cusco are all pre-Inca.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
They're built thousands
of years before the Incas.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Then they were destroyed,
even perhaps several times

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in wars or cataclysmic
Earth changes.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Later, the Incas did
occupy these buildings

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and repaired them
as best they could

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.555 align:middle line:90%
with this kind of construction.

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Here's the most famous
of all here at the Sun

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Temple of Ollantaytambo.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Giant 100-ton blocks of granite.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And what's so unusual are
these thin strips of granite

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that are filling in
between the giant blocks.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
My theory is that at one
time, most of the building

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
had these giant blocks with
thin strips of finely cut

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:90%
granite between them.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But many of these thin
strips have either

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
been pried out by people or
through earthquake activity,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
leaving gaps between the large
blocks, although not here.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they were later filled
in with the crummy small stones

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that we see on many sides
of the Sun Temple here.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Come around to this
side, and we'll

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
see what is a very
unusual keystone cut that

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
is part of the wall here.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's a vertical
keystone cut,

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.285 align:middle line:84%
so it can't be in
its original place.

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a block that must have been
moved and then later filled in.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Follow me.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
This wall was destroyed
at some point,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but then what
happened was it was

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
rebuilt by the megalith
builders themselves.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
They, for instance, put
this large block into place.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And curiously, it has
also a T-shaped keystone

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:90%
cut right here.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
However, this can't have
been the original spot

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
for this stone, or
certainly it wasn't

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
meant to be here, because these
T-shaped keystone cuts would

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
have had to have been
on a flat surface

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
so that the molten
metal would have been

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:90%
poured into the keystone cut.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And there always has to be
a corresponding keystone

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:90%
cut on another block.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that this
building has been rebuilt twice.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Once by the megalith
builders themselves

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
who put this block
in a second place

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
from where it had originally
been, but then later

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the Incas filled in this
space between the large blocks

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.528 align:middle line:84%
with these small crummy stones,
and even mud filling here.

00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
This weighs so much that even
today, a modern construction

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:84%
company in Peru couldn't
really move or build

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
with such giant
blocks like this.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask yourself,
why would the Incas or anyone

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
want to build with
such giant blocks

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
when it would have been
so much easier for them

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to build with these small
blocks like we see here?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:84%
It appears that what would be
so difficult for us was somehow

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%
easy for these builders.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Did they have some
kind of levitation,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
anti-gravity that could

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
vibrate these crystalline
blocks, make them weightless,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
move them around effortlessly?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Even then they would have needed
to probably cut these blocks

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
with giant saws, some
kind of power tools

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:90%
in order to build in this way.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That's how we would build
in a modern situation today.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But yet, the lifting of
giant blocks like this

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
would require huge cranes and
other massive infrastructure.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It really begs the
question, why are

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
they trying to build in
such a difficult way?

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Was it actually easy for them?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's another one of
the giant granite blocks

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:90%
here at Ollantaytambo.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
tell-tale T-shaped cut

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
known as a keystone cut.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we see at
Pumapunku, also at Tiahuanaco.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And we see it here
at Ollantaytambo.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
These unusual cuts are
made in these giant blocks.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And another corresponding T cut
would be on another giant block

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
here, and then molten
metals are poured

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.498 align:middle line:90%
into these keystone cuts.

00:14:22.498 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of unusual
architecture and construction

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that we see all over the world
on certain megalithic blocks,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
not only here in Peru,
but also in Bolivia.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
We see it in Egypt,
in Angkor Wat.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We see it in Com and
My Son in Vietnam.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
We see it in India and
even in Greece and Turkey.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the sign of the
ancient megalithic builders

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:84%
who were building
around the world.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:84%
These are the blocks
here on the lower terrace

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
that have been blown
apart from the walls.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
And look at this.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
T-shaped keystone cut.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't seen this one before.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:90%
It too is on a finely cut block.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So this block, which has
been nicely cut and dressed,

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:90%
very sharp corners, very smooth.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And we see another keystone
cut here at this far edge

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It too would have been,
when originally placed,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
would have been turned so the
keystone cuts would have been

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
on a flat surface,
and then they would

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
have had to have been fitted
to another giant granite block

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
with also a T-shaped
keystone cut on it.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
These blocks themselves are
evidence that the Incas did not

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
build Ollantaytambo, but that
this site was built thousands

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
of years before the
Incas, and the Incas later

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
occupied this site
and rebuilt as best

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:90%
they could some of the walls.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Here behind me on this mountain,
across the Urubamba River that

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
goes down to Machu Picchu,
we see the mountain

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.375 align:middle line:90%
where the quarry is located.

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Several miles away
up here, there

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
are giant squared rectangular
blocks of granite.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They've been cut from
the mountainside.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:90%
They've been hewn.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
There's even evidence of
giant saws being in use.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Many of the blocks
are still up there.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:84%
They were never moved
from the quarry,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:90%
or they weren't moved very far.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Yet hundreds of these
giant granite blocks

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:84%
were dragged from the
top of this mountain,

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
down a series of trails,
across the river,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:84%
through these fields, and then
up on top of this mountain

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to be placed here at the
site of the Sun Temple.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Yet many of these stones
were never put into place,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
or conversely, they were
blasted apart from their walls

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and scattered apart.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Like below me, you can see many
giant squared granite blocks.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
This too in my mind is
evidence of the ancient wars

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of the past, and the cataclysmic
changes that occurred thousands

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Shortly, we'll be
leaving on horseback,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be crossing the river.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:90%
It will take us many hours.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll be following this trail
on the other side of the river,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:90%
along this hillside.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Will be switchbacking
along the trails,

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
high up onto this mountain
where the quarry is

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:90%
located about 1,000 feet up.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There we'll see many
of these huge granite

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.755 align:middle line:84%
blocks, many of them
apparently cut by giant saws.

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There's amazing
acoustics here too,

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
where sound carries
a great deal.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Even it was possible
that sound was

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
used for levitating and
moving some of these blocks.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Some of the finest stone
construction work in the world

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:90%
is seen right here.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:84%
From here, we'll be
taking this Inca trail up

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the
mountain, or near it

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to the great megalithic
quarry here at Ollantaytambo.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It's there that we'll see
evidence of ancient machining,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:84%
including evidence
of a giant saw.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.778 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also see a
huge round stone wheel.

00:20:03.778 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So now we're saddled up, and
we're headed up to Cachicata.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.025 align:middle line:84%
Cachicata is the great
megalithic quarry

00:20:14.025 --> 00:20:14.825 align:middle line:90%
up on the mountain.

00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're here at Cachicata,
the great megalithic quarry

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain
above Ollantaytambo.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see
the giant blocks

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of granite scattered around
on the hillside behind me.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
In a few moments,
we're going to look

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
at some of these giant stones
that have been squared,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
ready to be moved
down the mountain.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of these stones
weigh 100 tons.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The best stones were
already removed from here

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and taken down the mountain,
across the Urubamba River,

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and then up the other
side to the Sun Temple

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:90%
at Ollantaytambo.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
see now is amazing.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We'll see evidence
of giants saws that

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
were cutting the stones.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll see a huge
round stone, proving

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient peoples of
the Andes knew about the wheel,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, made
giant stone wheels.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of enigmas here

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:90%
at the quarry at Ollantaytambo.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
How did they cut the stones?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Were they using power
tools, as we surmise?

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And then after they had squared
off these giant 100-ton stones,

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
how were they able to move
them down the mountain?

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
To us, it seems
incredibly difficult

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:90%
that they did any of this.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we almost
have to look at it

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:84%
as if it was easy
for them, that they

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of levitation,
some sort of anti-gravity

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:84%
means of levitating the
stones, making them weightless,

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and then moving them
down the mountain.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So follow me now as we look at
some of the megalithic stones

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:90%
here at Cachicata.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Here we are at part
of the rock scree

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
at the quarry at Ollantaytambo,
and our guide Wilson

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:58.585 align:middle line:84%
is showing us a cave with
some Inca mummies in it.

00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that there
was an earthquake here

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
about 15 years ago that
caused some of these rocks

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
to come down, and then
this cave was discovered.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The mummies inside are
several hundred years old.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Probably from around the
time of the conquest.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Here, let's have a look.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Here's an unusual stone here
at the quarry at Ollantaytambo.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
This one here, you can
see very smooth here.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
stones that I believe

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
was cut with the giant
saws that they used here

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
at Ollantaytambo.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
There's really no other
way that a stone like this

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
could be sliced so smooth
and such a large piece.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We'll see in a
minute another stone

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
in which the giant saws
were cutting at it,

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:90%
only they stopped.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a piece of granite
that was sliced off just

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.515 align:middle line:84%
like a piece of
bread by a giant saw.

00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Here's another stone that's
been sliced by the giant saw.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
You can see here the
saw was cutting in.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a piece that
broke off, actually.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Had a natural crack in it.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But right here is where the
saw was cutting into it.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
For reasons we don't know,
they never moved these stones.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But of course, many hundreds
of these giant stones

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.606 align:middle line:84%
were moved down the mountain
and across the Urubamba River

00:24:48.606 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to the great fortress
at Ollantaytambo.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural cave
here up at the quarry,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and stones have
been piled here just

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to make a shelter for a
llama or alpaca herder.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But right in this area,
according to our guide Wilson,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
there's a cache
of Inca treasure,

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
some kind of gold
hoard that was buried

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
with one of the Inca royalty,
or something like that.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The Incas would
make gold figurines

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of llamas and peanuts
and even corn,

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and bury it with the
important people.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:47.602 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.602 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And according to
our guide Wilson,

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the stones at the
Sun Temple of Ollantaytambo

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:90%
have come from this quarry.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
special type of stone

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
that's only found here
around this mountain.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not found actually in
the town of Ollantaytambo.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of
crystalline granite.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of granite is
not just very hard and heavy,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's a kind of granite
that would resonate as well.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Tiny quartz crystals
are embedded

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in all of these stones.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that may have
been one of the reasons

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that these stones
were chosen is because

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
of its crystalline quality,
this kind of stone,

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, could be
levitated more easily

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with the anti-gravity
devices that I

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
suspect that they
had in order to move

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.777 align:middle line:90%
the really large stones.

00:27:02.777 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Here at the quarry is one
of the most unusual stones.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to our
guide, this is unique,

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and you do not find a
circular round stone

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
like this down at the Sun
Temple of Ollantaytambo.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:90%
But clearly, this was made here.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It's got a hole in the
middle for an axle.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Almost looks like some
giant Fred Flintstone stone

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:90%
wheel or something.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The front of it
here is very smooth.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like the giant saw blade
just came down and sliced

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:90%
this stone.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:57.731 align:middle line:84%
Then it was machined and
bashed into a circle.

00:27:57.731 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange
things about this stone

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
too is it's said that the
Incas and other ancient peoples

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Andes didn't
know about the wheel.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here at the
quarry at Ollantaytambo,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
they made a giant stone
wheel that weighs many tons.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to wonder what
this stone wheel was for.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Was it actually part of the
way that they moved some

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of the giant 100-ton stones?

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Why the axle in the middle?

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was to be a grinding
stone in a mill, as often used

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:90%
in Europe and other places.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And Wilson here is saying
that this round tubular stone

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:90%
is an axle.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Here, Wilson.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Try and pick this up here.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So was this part of the axle
that was meant for this stone?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps there were two.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
What would this have been
some giant megalithic stone

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.332 align:middle line:90%
cart or something?

00:29:07.332 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It's baffling, really, what
the purpose of this stone was,

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and even how it was made.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Now just right over here, we'll
see the amazing giant stone

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
that still has the saw marks
from the huge circular blade

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that was slicing
these giant granite

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.848 align:middle line:90%
blocks like a loaf of bread.

00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like with the
giant saws here at the quarry,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
they began to square
off this massive piece

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:90%
of 100-ton granite.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Even 200 tons.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They began cutting
the face here.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
They also began squaring
it off this side.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:84%
There's another beginnings
of a saw mark here.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly straight.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Here's the main piece
where they, again,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
began to slice off about
an eight-inch thin piece

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:90%
of granite right here.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can still see the
remains of the saw mark.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Also, the lichen patches
on the stone are huge.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:84%
In my estimation, this
town has been sitting here

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:84%
in a quarry for many
thousands of years.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.785 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen quite a bit
here at the great quarry

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:90%
at Ollantaytambo.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of ancient
machining, giant stones

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that were sliced with
saws and never moved down

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:90%
from the quarry.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It's getting late now, so
we'll have to start down.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Here's even another stone
that was sawn off perhaps

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:90%
from this block.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.752 align:middle line:84%
It too was never
moved from the quarry,

00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
though it was squared
and ready to go.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:84%
At some point, the building
and all of the quarrying

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.270 align:middle line:84%
here just came to a stop
thousands of years ago.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.675 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was the
end of a great war

00:31:35.675 --> 00:31:40.814 align:middle line:84%
or some natural cataclysm that
just stopped all of the work

00:31:40.814 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:90%
here at Ollantaytambo.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.950 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the giant walls

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.635 align:middle line:84%
at Saqsaywaman, the megalithic
fortress above Cusco.

00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The stone used here is limestone
rather than granite, as

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:90%
at Ollantaytambo.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
In some areas like
here, earthquakes

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:84%
have begun to split the
stone open, pulling it apart.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But originally, and
even in most cases,

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:84%
today, the stones are
perfectly fitted together.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Plus they have this
curious pillow shaping.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We see this in other areas
of the world, including

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the underwater stones at
Bimini in the Bahamas,

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
known as the Bimini
Road of Atlantis.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting too to
note here at Saqsaywaman

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
with these massive walls
is how they've done corners

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
with stones that are
coming around the corner,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
still perfectly fitted in these
polygonal jigsaw patterns.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You see here in
some places where

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
some of the megalithic
stones are missing,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and modern Peruvian
archaeologists

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
have had to reconstruct
parts of the wall.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Yet even though
today's archaeologists

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
have at their disposal modern
equipment, cranes, modern power

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
saws, and things like that,
they still use very small stones

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:90%
to build.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Where, in fact, they would be
replacing perhaps one or maybe

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
two giant stones, yet they've
used probably somewhere

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:90%
between 20 and 30 small stones.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So it begs the question, why
were the megalith builders

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
using such large stones
when even today's architects

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and engineers are using very
small stones to replace it?

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why is
building with such large stones

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is extremely difficult,
even for today's engineers

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:90%
and architects.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And so in fact, they're
building, as we would today,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.250 align:middle line:90%
with much smaller stones.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:53.679 align:middle line:84%
It makes me wonder,
was it somehow easy

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.966 align:middle line:84%
for the megalith builders to
build with such large stones?

00:34:57.966 --> 00:35:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It was easy for them
to quarry these stones.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It was easy for them
to cut these stones.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it was easy for
them to move these stones

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and place them in these giant
walls that we see today.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Many archaeologists
think that Saqsaywaman

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:90%
was a pre-Inca building.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And just as today in
Cusco, the modern Spanish

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.230 align:middle line:84%
are inhabiting
buildings that were

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
built a long time before
them, and the Spanish

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:90%
did not build those buildings.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It's also a theory
that the Incas

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:84%
also inhabited buildings
that were already built.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Buildings such as Saqsaywaman.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:49.990 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
famous walls at Saqsaywaman,

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's famous because
carved into the wall

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:90%
appears to be a serpent.

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there
are seven holes here.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:07.210 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's thought by some people
that what this corresponds to

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.780 align:middle line:84%
is the Kundalini
energy that's talked

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:90%
about by the ancient Hindus.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And the Kundalini energy
goes through the spine

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and corresponds to seven
chakras in our body,

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and that this is the serpent
with the chakras carved

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:90%
into this stone.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange
stories about Saqsaywaman

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
is that part of
the lost treasure

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Incas from the
ancient Sun Temple,

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the Coricancha in Cusco, was
taken into a secret tunnel

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
system inside the mountain of
Saqsaywaman where we are now.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this area
is a newly excavated part

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:90%
of Saqsaywaman.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm already underground here.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is apparently
one of the ancient tunnels

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that once riddled the
entire megalithic fortress

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of Saqsaywaman.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So follow me, and we'll
go inside the tunnel

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:84%
system of this ancient
megalithic fortress.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see how this
tunnel here at Saqsaywaman

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:90%
is also lined with stones.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And here, the roof has caved
in, so we can see the sky.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But then as we continue farther,
we have the roof once again.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're clearly inside of
a man-made tunnel system.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.385 align:middle line:90%
You can see blocks of stone.

00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:27.205 align:middle line:84%
You can see stone up here that's
part of the roof of the tunnel.

00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.420 align:middle line:84%
At one time, this
tunnel may have

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:84%
led to the lost
treasure of the Incas,

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
but today, it dead
ends down here

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.115 align:middle line:90%
inside this dark passageway.

00:38:46.115 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Here on this backside of
the Saqsaywaman fortress,

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:13.620 align:middle line:84%
you see also these curious
stones that are carved out.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of, like,
seats are made.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:25.117 align:middle line:84%
It looks almost like a throne
for a giant or something.

00:39:25.117 --> 00:39:26.700 align:middle line:84%
There's other places
around here where

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.600 align:middle line:90%
there's upside down stairways.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It's very well cut,
the stone here.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like someone has
taken a power tool or some kind

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.640 align:middle line:84%
of laser cutter, and
just cut out the stone,

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they
were practicing.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Other areas seem as if they're
for other giant blocks,

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:84%
such as this one, to be placed
into various niches and things

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:84%
like that where part
of some structure

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
would have been originally,
and now has been completely

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:84%
dismantled, possibly in some
kind of cataclysmic Earth

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
changes or even some
catastrophic war.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:37.124 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.124 --> 00:40:41.880 align:middle line:84%
This is another area here
in the back of Saqsaywaman

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:84%
where it appears like an
upside down staircase has

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.915 align:middle line:90%
been cut into this rock.

00:40:48.915 --> 00:40:55.065 align:middle line:84%
This area too, very
straight walls right here.

00:40:55.065 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask yourself,
what were they doing here?

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Why even carve this
rock like this?

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like this rock even was
perhaps not where it is now,

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and has been turned
over in some topsy-turvy

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:21.290 align:middle line:84%
cataclysm or something that's
flipped this rock over.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:90%
We see more of the cuts here.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Down over here
too, it's been cut.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It's really pretty
baffling, really.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask yourself,
why are they doing it?

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And then once again, it looks
as if they're using power tools

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and saws to cut it
at the various angles

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and articulate it so
finely, as we can see.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:42:05.470 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:10.420 align:middle line:84%
This is Cusco, the ancient
capital of the Incas.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Just to the north of Cusco
is the Sacred Valley.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And this has the cities
of Calca, Uki, Urubamba,

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and Ollantaytambo.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Through the Sacred Valley
goes the Urubamba River.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
That river flows farther
down into the high jungle

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to Machu Picchu, also a
megalithic city like Cusco.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:46.500 align:middle line:84%
All around Cusco are many
fascinating megalithic sites.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the great
cities of the world.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And today, it's the
number one tourist

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.760 align:middle line:90%
spot in all of South America.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:09.028 align:middle line:90%

We're here at the main
plaza in Ica, Peru.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And here in this plaza
is the central plaza

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:90%
here in Ica, Peru.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the
strangest museums in the world

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is the Museum of Dr.
Cabrera right here.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.744 align:middle line:90%
Follow me as we go inside.

00:44:39.744 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's closed most of the
time, and it's only open now

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.530 align:middle line:90%
by special appointment.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people here in
Ica have heard of this museum,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.400 align:middle line:90%
but they rarely go inside here.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Follow me into Dr.
Cabrera's cabinet

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:84%
of curiosities, one of the
strangest museums in the world.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Inside these five rooms,
Dr. Cabrera's Museum,

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:84%
are thousands,
tens of thousands,

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:84%
even maybe hundreds
of thousands of rocks,

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:34.470 align:middle line:84%
carved stones,
petrified objects.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And carved onto them are some
of the most bizarre scenes

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.380 align:middle line:90%
imaginable.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Dinosaurs, people doing
surgical operations,

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:84%
people looking in
telescopes, oddball animals,

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and other scenes.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible collection
of weirdness and impossible

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Here's the doctor himself.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
He passed away some
years ago, and now it

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is his wife who still runs this
private museum here in Ica.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera would sit here at
his desk among his many stones.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:84%
He was the ancestor
of one of the founders

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.360 align:middle line:90%
of this city in Peru.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera was a very
well-known citizen here in Ica.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:90%
He was a surgeon.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:90%
He was a wealthy landowner.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was a collector
of the very strange rocks

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:90%
that are found nearby.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.880 align:middle line:84%
These rocks in Ica were actually
found at a nearby town called

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.596 align:middle line:90%
Ocucaje.

00:47:01.596 --> 00:47:05.270 align:middle line:84%
They've come from a
secret underground area,

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.190 align:middle line:90%
according to the doctor.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of the rocks
include bizarre scenes

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:19.340 align:middle line:84%
of prehistoric animals, humans
interacting with animals,

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.650 align:middle line:84%
other scenes of people
with telescopes, performing

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:84%
operations, including heart
surgery and trepanning,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Many of the rocks
are very small.

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Others are medium-sized.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:44.080 align:middle line:84%
While other rocks are huge
boulders like this one.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scenes,
we can't really

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.910 align:middle line:90%
tell what people are doing.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Others, it's quite
clear that they're

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:84%
performing some operation,
looking at the stars,

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.710 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps attacking
what would appear

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.130 align:middle line:90%
to be dinosaurs and things.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this one here.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:84%
What seems to be a brontosaurus
or some other kind of dinosaur,

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
a man with an axe
is battling it.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera himself believed
that many of these stones

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:30.840 align:middle line:84%
were somehow created during
the Mesozoic period, a time

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:84%
60 million years ago when
humans did not exist,

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.810 align:middle line:84%
according to the mainstream,
but dinosaurs did.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Here in Dr. Cabrera's
office, he's

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.630 align:middle line:84%
got many photographs
of his expeditions

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
famous people who've

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:16.330 align:middle line:84%
come here to meet him
and see his museum,

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.010 align:middle line:84%
including Shirley
MacLaine, the actress here.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Photo taken in probably the
late 1970s with Dr. Cabrera.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Here he sits at his desk.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.650 align:middle line:84%
This is only a small portion
of the many thousands

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:90%
of rocks he has.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Here also we see what seems
to be some prehistoric animal.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:50.446 align:middle line:84%
Also another man here riding
on some kind of stegosaurus.

00:49:50.446 --> 00:49:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics have said that
Dr. Cabrera was sincere,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.140 align:middle line:84%
but that he was gullible,
and that local peasants

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.345 align:middle line:84%
in the nearby village of
Ocucaje took advantage of him.

00:50:09.345 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was quite wealthy,
so he would pay them

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.820 align:middle line:84%
a small price for each of
these rocks that they found.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's said that the
local people actually created

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.840 align:middle line:90%
these rocks for the doctor.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:84%
The doctor himself,
though, believed

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that all of these
rocks were genuine,

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:84%
although a few might
have been faked.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It was his belief that these
stones were 60 million or 70

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:43.320 align:middle line:84%
million years old,
and that human beings

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:49.200 align:middle line:84%
had lived at a time of the
dinosaurs that long ago.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Other researchers who
believe that the stones here

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:57.770 align:middle line:84%
in Dr. Cabrera's museum
are authentic, their belief

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is that dinosaurs didn't become
extinct 65 million years ago,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and that dinosaurs somehow
managed to survive down

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.910 align:middle line:84%
through the ages to the
time of human beings,

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and that perhaps these
stones are only 10,000

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.550 align:middle line:90%
years old or 20,000 years old.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And much like the Loch Ness
Monster or the Mokele-mbembe

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Congo, we have
stories of giant saurians

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:84%
living throughout the
ages in small numbers

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.350 align:middle line:90%
and still surviving.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Another curious collection
that is like Dr. Cabrera's is

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:52.550 align:middle line:84%
the strange collection of
ceramics at Acambaro, Mexico.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:58.280 align:middle line:84%
These ceramics also show people
interacting with what would

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.516 align:middle line:90%
seem to be extinct dinosaurs.

00:52:00.516 --> 00:52:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into some of the
other rooms of Dr. Cabrera's

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.875 align:middle line:90%
strange cabinet of curiosities.

00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange stones
seems to show two people inside

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of a wheeled vehicle, and
it's being drawn by a horse.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Horses weren't known
in South America

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.890 align:middle line:84%
until the time of
the Spanish conquest,

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
so perhaps this is an
indication that these stones

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.770 align:middle line:90%
were made more recently.

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stones
are figures at Nazca

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.890 align:middle line:84%
such as the monkey
with the spiral

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:53.910 align:middle line:90%
tail, the spider, the condor.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
familiar figures that we

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:90%
can see from the air at Nazca.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Were the figures at Nazca
also ancient figures

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:09.850 align:middle line:84%
from the time of the dinosaurs,
as Dr. Cabrera believed?

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Or again, perhaps
the dinosaurs lived

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in South America up until
relatively modern times,

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.900 align:middle line:90%
like 10,000 or 20,000 years ago.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Or as many people suggest,
the entire collection

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:30.105 align:middle line:84%
is a fake, a hoax that
was pulled on Dr. Cabrera.

00:53:30.105 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera himself completely
believed that all of this

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.300 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:49.280 align:middle line:84%
All of it was somehow
incredibly ancient.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of Dr. Cabrera's
large stones in this room

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
seem to show the world maps
with different continents.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cabrera believed
that some showed

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.651 align:middle line:84%
where Atlantis had been and
other lost continents and South

00:54:06.651 --> 00:54:07.451 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:54:07.451 --> 00:54:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.240 align:middle line:84%
He had his own interpretation
of many of the stones.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, a lot of them were
very clear of what they showed.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Prehistoric animals,
people interacting

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.220 align:middle line:90%
with them or each other.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Yet some of the stones show
things that were very obscure.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.945 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
their meaning was.

00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the Regional
Museum here in Ica.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Inside are artifacts
from the Paracas

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
culture, the Ica culture,
the Nazca culture,

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:84%
including some of the
most unusual skulls

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.540 align:middle line:84%
of cranial deformation
seen anywhere in the world.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Follow me inside the
Ica Regional Museum.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Here in the Ica
Regional Museum we

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.160 align:middle line:84%
see some unusual skulls,
including red-haired skull

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.630 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Red-haired people being
thought from northern Europe,

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.390 align:middle line:84%
typically, and not
here in South America.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And over here, we have the very
strange cranial deformation

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that we find here all over
South America, especially Peru.

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:44.790 align:middle line:90%


00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You can see the very
elongated, deformed heads,

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.920 align:middle line:84%
some of the most unusual
that we find here

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.548 align:middle line:90%
around Paracas, Nazca, and Ica.

00:55:57.548 --> 00:56:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:04.410 align:middle line:84%
This was done by
taking small babies

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and wrapping their head
before their cranium had fused

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:84%
together, and they create this
elongated head, or sometimes

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.260 align:middle line:90%
a flattened head.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.749 align:middle line:84%
And over here, we
see other craniums

00:56:22.749 --> 00:56:23.790 align:middle line:90%
that have been trepanned.

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:29.750 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Their heads are elongated too
and deformed in many ways,

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:39.650 align:middle line:84%
but then they've had
their skulls cut open

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:90%
while they were alive.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Possibly their skulls had been
damaged in battle by a mace,

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.870 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps it was even some
kind of brain surgery because

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.060 align:middle line:90%
of headaches or something.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And then a gold or silver
plate was put onto their head,

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and then their cranium
and skull was healed over

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and skin formed over
the gold plates.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Cranial deformation is one
of the most common things

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.900 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Ancient peoples
in Malta, Vanuatu,

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:22.130 align:middle line:84%
the Kurds in northern
Iraq, in Egypt,

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:27.550 align:middle line:84%
such as Akhenaten and Nefertiti,
and here in South America.

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Cranial deformation,
creating these cone heads.

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Why was this unusual technique
done around the world?

00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Modern archaeologists
say it's simply

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:48.280 align:middle line:84%
a coincidence, and the fact
that people on Africa and South

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.510 align:middle line:84%
America, even in North America,
in Europe, in the Middle East

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:57.230 align:middle line:84%
all did this
cranial deformation.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there really some connection
between these ancient cultures?

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:84%
This would mean
transoceanic travel

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.620 align:middle line:84%
across the Pacific
and the Atlantic,

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:15.470 align:middle line:84%
bringing this unusual technique
of elongating the heads.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And why did they do it?

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Why was it that
ancient people wanted

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.890 align:middle line:90%
these strange, elongated heads?

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Was it because they were trying
to imitate some ancient people,

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:38.360 align:middle line:84%
even possibly extraterrestrials
who naturally looked like this?

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.170 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, like
we see here, they

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.860 align:middle line:84%
had literally doubled
the cranium capacity,

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.400 align:middle line:84%
thereby allowing their brains
to be twice the size of ours

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.420 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Were they somehow
smarter than we are

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and better psychic abilities?

00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a diorama of
a person being trepanned.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible
that he's a cone

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.700 align:middle line:90%
head with cranial deformation.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason,
his scalp is being cut away,

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and bones in his head
are being cut out.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Like many, he survived
this ancient operation

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and went on to
live for many years

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.790 align:middle line:90%
with a gold plate in his head.

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
rare Inca quipus.

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:40.335 align:middle line:84%
The Incas were said
to not have writing.

00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's also said they didn't
have the wheel either.

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:50.595 align:middle line:84%
What they did have were the
quipu, these knotted ropes.

00:59:50.595 --> 00:59:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And each knot and strand
had a special meaning.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They could use it for
counting, for sending messages,

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.920 align:middle line:84%
communicating through
long distances.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this was the way that
the Incas kept records.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Some quipus are incredibly
large and long because

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:21.140 align:middle line:90%
of the complicated messages.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Hiram Bingham, who
discovered Machu Picchu,

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
writes in his book that there
was a legend that the Incas did

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:33.780 align:middle line:90%
have writing originally.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
there was a plague

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
going throughout
the Inca empire,

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and priests came to
the Inca, the king,

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and they said that the
cause of this plague

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
was writing and the
trafficking of books.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
At that time, according
to Hiram Bingham,

01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
the Incas forbade
any kind of writing

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and then switched to the unusual
quipu system of keeping records

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
on knotted ropes.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Here at the Regional
Museum in Ica

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:18.196 align:middle line:84%
is actually a copy of the
Nazca lines on the Nazca plain.

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:22.205 align:middle line:84%
So you can get kind of a good
perspective on how they look.

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just a copy, but right now,
we're off to the real thing,

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.055 align:middle line:90%
the lines that Nazca.

01:01:29.055 --> 01:01:35.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
We're here now in
the town of Ocucaje,

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:42.200 align:middle line:90%
a small village near to Ica.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
This is where the stones in
Dr. Cabrera's strange museum

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.340 align:middle line:90%
came from.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:55.084 align:middle line:84%
I found these guys here
at the local cantina,

01:01:55.084 --> 01:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and they say they're
going to show

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
us the local house and
museum, they're calling it,

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
where Dr. Cabrera's
stones came from.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%


01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We're walking through the town
of Ocucaje with my friends.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.577 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find the source
of Dr. Cabrera's stones.

01:02:16.577 --> 01:02:17.377 align:middle line:90%
That's our plan.

01:02:17.377 --> 01:02:20.720 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
We're here at a man's
house in Ocucaje,

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
a very small
village near to Ica.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Between Ica and Nazca, actually.

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:39.790 align:middle line:84%
We've just met Arturo who is
the caretaker of this museum,

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and he says he's
going to show us

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the rocks that came
here from this secret place

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
in Ocucaje.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is supposedly the
origin of all the rocks

01:02:53.830 --> 01:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Cabrera has in
his strange museum in Ica.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:06.812 align:middle line:84%
Arturo's going to show us
some of his inner rooms here.

01:03:06.812 --> 01:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:10.914 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>All right.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying is
that there is a mountain

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.045 align:middle line:90%
nearby here, the Cerro--

01:03:21.045 --> 01:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Las Lumadas.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The Cerro Las Lumadas,
the Mountain of Las Lumadas.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And there at that
place are these fossils

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.360 align:middle line:90%
of these prehistoric animals.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying they're
300 million years old.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, continue.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the head of a dinosaur
and part of the vertebrae,

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a baby
dinosaur here with the head

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:52.744 align:middle line:90%
and some vertebrae.

01:03:52.744 --> 01:03:53.544 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

01:03:53.544 --> 01:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Interesante.

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
He found these fossilized
vertebrae and part

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of a chest cavity here
in a different place,

01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:04.300 align:middle line:90%
but also nearby.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying he found
six fossilized dinosaur

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:14.770 align:middle line:84%
eggs, such as this one right
here would be one of them.

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
this stone he found--

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and this is like Dr.
Cabrera's stones in that--

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.210 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It has been engraved
very similar

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Cabrera's stones.

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.908 align:middle line:84%
And it clearly shows
what is some kind

01:04:35.908 --> 01:04:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of long-necked
brontosaurus-type dinosaur.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:46.538 align:middle line:84%
Fire is, like, coming out
of his mouth or something.

01:04:46.538 --> 01:04:50.630 align:middle line:90%


01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
His tail is wrapping
down around this way.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's his body.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It has the same kind of etchings
as Dr. Cabrera's stones.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Here's his head
going out this way.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying also that this
stone is an authentic stone

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that he found.

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
He's saying it's Neolithic.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps he's saying here
that people either witnessed

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
dinosaurs here somehow in
very, very ancient times,

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or somehow perhaps
they saw fossils

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of some of the dinosaurs
and engraved the stone.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So Arturo?

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>Si?

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.040 align:middle line:90%

>>[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:05:47.345 --> 01:06:04.800 align:middle line:90%


01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, OK.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him if he made this
stone, and he's saying no.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
He is saying this is an
authentic, original stone

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
that he has found in this
area like these other fossils.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
So Arturo--

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.480 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:34.072 align:middle line:90%


01:06:34.072 --> 01:06:36.886 align:middle line:90%
>>[SPEAKING SPANISH]

01:06:36.886 --> 01:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%


01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OK, OK.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying that
a man before him

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
was selling these
stones to Dr. Cabrera.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
According to him, he thinks
that many of the stones

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
are authentic, but
perhaps many are fake.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
He's saying he doesn't know
whether all the stones in Dr.

01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:44.776 align:middle line:90%
Cabrera's museum are authentic.

01:07:44.776 --> 01:07:54.810 align:middle line:90%


01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Here's a mummy.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
This mummy also has red hair.

01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.955 align:middle line:90%
He's a red-haired mummy.

01:08:01.955 --> 01:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
This guy has quite the
private collection here.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the last room here
in Arturo's private museum,

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and it also contains
some mummies.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they also
have red hair.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And there are some--

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:28.229 align:middle line:84%
apparently mummies
of llamas and things.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Also, here are some
shuttles for weaving

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and some ropes and /
these would be only, say,

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060 align:middle line:84%
800 years old, or
something like that.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.609 align:middle line:90%
Maybe only 500 or 600.

01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So Arturo's got quite
a collection here.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Some things are
500, 600 years old.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Others he says, are
many, many millions

01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:06.479 align:middle line:84%
of years old, including
the one rock that's

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
very similar to those
in Dr. Cabrera's museum.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:18.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's pretty interesting
and baffling in a way.

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:21.229 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly
a lot of the stuff

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.020 align:middle line:90%
here is clearly authentic.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet you still have to wonder
about Dr. Cabrera's stones

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:33.529 align:middle line:90%
and the stone he showed us.

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Arturo's basically saying
that the dinosaurs around here

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.979 align:middle line:84%
lived 65 million years
ago, but that they

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
survived down to Neolithic
times, say, 20,000 years or so.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And that they got
smaller and smaller,

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
so they weren't the
same giant dinosaurs.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's his theory, which was
different than Dr. Cabrera's,

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that people weren't living
65 million years ago,

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
but rather, dinosaurs somehow
survived in this area,

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and that it would have
been a different climate.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And that people were somehow
witnessing real reptiles.

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:25.860 align:middle line:90%


01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.308 align:middle line:84%
Well, Arturo, muchos
gracias para es.

01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:29.805 align:middle line:90%
Ah, gracias.

01:10:29.805 --> 01:10:54.270 align:middle line:90%


01:10:54.270 --> 01:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This village and the strange
artifacts that are found here

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
are Earth-shatteringly changing
the history of the world,

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.745 align:middle line:84%
and of humanity, and
of Darwin and you

01:11:10.745 --> 01:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
said, Schuler, and many of the
paleontologists' beliefs of man

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and reptiles and
fossilization and extinction,

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and even where man originated.

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
That the secrets of all this can
be found here and around this

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
small village, and that the
evidence that he has found--

01:11:35.530 --> 01:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Cabrera apparently
put some of it in his museum--

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that this really changes our
ideas of where we came from,

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
where man originated.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And what Arturo is
basically saying

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is that humanity has originated
in this area of Peru,

01:11:57.290 --> 01:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and would have been apparently
even millions of years ago.

01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
That this is where human beings
came from and originated.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.920 align:middle line:90%


01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.445 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen the
strange museum here

01:12:17.445 --> 01:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
at Ocucaje, small
village near Ica.

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the village where Dr.
Cabrera's bizarre collection

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.820 align:middle line:90%
originated from.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
He was paying villagers to
collect these stones for him.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stones
apparently are authentic,

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
while others of the stones were
apparently replicas and fakes

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.950 align:middle line:90%
that were sold to Dr. Cabrera.

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We may never really
know the truth

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of the origin of Dr.
Cabrera's strange collection

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and how authentic or
fake it was, and just

01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:56.820 align:middle line:90%
exactly what Dr. Cabrera knew.

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.450 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:02.020 align:middle line:90%
That concludes it for here.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And for now, we'll
get back and head

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.150 align:middle line:90%
on to the Pan-American Highway.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Go further south to Nazca and
the strange figures etched

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:12.710 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:21.980 align:middle line:90%


01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We're here at the
famous Nazca plain.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
This is where the lines
and geoglyphs, trapezoids,

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
other geometric figures
are etched into the desert.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
The Nazca Desert is covered
with small black rocks,

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and it makes it
appear very dark.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The way the ancient peoples
made the lines at Nazca

01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
was by scraping away this
top layer of dark rocks

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and exposing a shallow line
or groove that was very light

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
colored.

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, from the
air, or possibly

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
from a nearby mountain, some
of the lines and geoglyphs

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.560 align:middle line:90%
could be seen.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And they look as light-colored
lines on a dark-colored desert.

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
What is really
mysterious about Nazca

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is not so much how the
lines were made, but why,

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and who did it?

01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange things about
the Nazca lines and geoglyphs

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
is that they're really only
well seen from the air.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, hundreds of tourists
fly around the Nazca plain

01:14:59.450 --> 01:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
every morning and afternoon
to view the incredible lines

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and geoglyphs that are
etched in an area for tens

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.856 align:middle line:90%
of square miles.

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%


01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We're on the observation
tower here at Nazca.

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And behind me, you can see
part of the Nazca plain,

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
including one of the
figures called The Hands.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers think
that it's actually a bat.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But the Nazca plain
goes for miles

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
in many directions between
the towns of Nazca and Palpa.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
idea that these lines

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
here at Nazca and
Palpa were really meant

01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
for people to view from the
air, just like we do today.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Every day, hundreds
of tourists get

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
into airplanes at
the Nazca airport

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
and fly over these lines.

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that in ancient
times, people also had flight?

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It's been speculated here that
the ancient Peruvians actually

01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:13.260 align:middle line:84%
built hot air balloons, and
they flew over the lines

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, many ancient records
show that people had flight.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:34.540 align:middle line:90%


01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of the lines here at Nazca
start from these rocky hills.

01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The lines begin here,
and they go out for miles

01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
out into the desert.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
There they intersect with
other lines and trapezoids.

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They also cross giant figures
of spiders and condors

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and flamingos and
spirals, and other things.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a giant mass of
strange trapezoids, lines,

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:11.570 align:middle line:90%
and geoglyphs.

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And what their purpose
is remains a mystery.

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%


01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
From the top of
some of these hills,

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see parts
of the Nazca lines

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
and some of the geoglyphs.

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But to really appreciate the
vast geometric figures here

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
at Nazca, you've really
got to go up in an airplane

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.675 align:middle line:84%
and view them from 300
or 400 feet in the air.

01:17:52.675 --> 01:18:12.510 align:middle line:90%


01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been able to see
portions of the Nazca lines

01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:20.730 align:middle line:84%
from this hilltop, but now
it's time to go to the airport

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and get into an airplane and
fly above the many figures

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious lines that we
can only see from the air.

01:18:29.010 --> 01:18:37.480 align:middle line:90%


01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The Nazca lines were
first discovered in 1946

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
when an American flyer
named Paul Kosok was doing

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.270 align:middle line:84%
some aerial surveys
here in Peru,

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was he who first
flew over the Nazca plain

01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
here and saw the lines
and geoglyphs that

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:03.360 align:middle line:90%
are so famous today.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Later, the famous German
archaeologist Maria Reiche

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
came here to Nazca and lived
here for over 30 years,

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
studying the Nazca
lines and the geoglyphs,

01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to get some kind of
indication of their purpose

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and meaning.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
She decided, as other
researchers have,

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that at least part
of the Nazca lines

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
astrological symbols.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They believe that certain animal
figures that are on the ground

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
are reflections of
constellations in the sky.

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
The problem here, though,
is that while some of these

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
might be constellations,
it doesn't explain

01:19:57.410 --> 01:20:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the over 10,000 lines that
go through the desert,

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
the trapezoids, things
that look like runways,

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
other spirals and intersecting
lines and geoglyphs.

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.270 align:middle line:90%
What was their purpose?

01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:15.000 align:middle line:90%


01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We're here at the Nazca
airport, and we're

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
going to interview
Eduardo Herron, one

01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of the well-known
pilots here at Nazca.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:28.079 align:middle line:84%
And he's the discoverer
of some of the glyphs.

01:20:28.079 --> 01:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to ask
him what he thinks

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
about the Nazca plain and about
some of his latest discoveries.

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>Welcome to Nazca
in this moment.

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I flew over the
Nazca lines for 31 years.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered in the
last years 354 designs.

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:48.250 align:middle line:10%
My first discovery was in
1991, and the last discovery

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:51.906 align:middle line:10%
is one month ago in Ica.

01:20:51.906 --> 01:20:53.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a big condor.

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.871 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful, beautiful
[SPEAKING SPANISH].

01:20:56.871 --> 01:20:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to my friends
in the Peruvian [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Institute and confirm
this new discovery.

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.680 align:middle line:90%
No, they said, Paracas Cavernas.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all to Paracas Necropolis.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Probably 500 years BC.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice.

01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
All the lines, in my
opinion, is the rituals.

01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:18.850 align:middle line:90%
The people needed water.

01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
These are rituals for the sun,
the moon, the dancing gods,

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and especially the condor.

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The condors announce the
water is coming to the coast.

01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the next spirit for
the [INAUDIBLE] for the life

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.190 align:middle line:90%
need the water.

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Probably these are only
rituals for this purpose.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
No, it's possible
the ancient Nazcas

01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
used the textiles with
feathers for the big kites

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and fly over the lines.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.120 align:middle line:90%
No?

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.130 align:middle line:90%
The scientists said, why not?

01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:56.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:21:56.930 --> 01:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the conference
in Mexico 10 years ago.

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.608 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little--

01:22:04.608 --> 01:22:05.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a kite.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
12 years, I don't remember
exactly [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.450 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE], excuse me.

01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The unseen Nazcas don't
see the lines in this life.

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
The unseen Nazcas die and the
spirit is up and see the lines.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.730 align:middle line:90%
For me, no problem.

01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I can believe it.

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
But this-- why not, you know?

01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>But humans also
have had flight.

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like today we have
airplanes and airships

01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and, of course, big kites.

01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And could humans have
had somehow flight

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%
in ancient times too?

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
For me-- you remember
the legends, you know?

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And the Inca legends too.

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Incas
have the big wings

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.400 align:middle line:90%
and fly over the territories.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, well there are
many, many legends.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.086 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:22:55.086 --> 01:22:56.002 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's possible.

01:22:56.002 --> 01:23:01.420 align:middle line:90%


01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the interesting
things here at Nazca

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:10.225 align:middle line:84%
is the aqueduct system
that's man-made.

01:23:10.225 --> 01:23:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's deep underground.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's made with a bunch
of rocks and lintels

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.166 align:middle line:84%
that are holding in
the aqueduct system.

01:23:21.166 --> 01:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%


01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's got these spiral
wells and paths

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
so that there's access to
this underground system that's

01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
bringing water from the Andes
down into the Nazca valley,

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing the water
out to irrigate the fields.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
This system has been here
for almost 2,000 years,

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.260 align:middle line:90%
it's thought.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And this aqueduct
system plays in one

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.300 align:middle line:84%
of the theories of
the Nazca lines,

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and that theory is that
the many aqueducts that

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
are throughout the Nazca valley
are somehow also marked by some

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.830 align:middle line:90%
of the lines out in the desert.

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%


01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
This theory, however, very, very
partial, and many researchers

01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
discount it altogether.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The aqueduct system
certainly does exist.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But the over 10,000
lines in the desert

01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:37.105 align:middle line:84%
would hardly seem to be marking
some aqueduct system, really.

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:42.200 align:middle line:90%


01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.536 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few different theories
about the Nazca lines.

01:24:46.536 --> 01:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
all have something

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to do with the solution to this
seemingly unsolvable mystery.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We've got the talk of
astronomical alignments

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and geoglyphs that are
constellations on the plain.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
We've also heard theories
of water pathways

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that are going
through the desert,

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps some of
the lines actually

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.176 align:middle line:84%
are marking some
of these aqueducts.

01:25:21.176 --> 01:25:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The lines were for
various rituals

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:30.330 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with the
annual coming of the water.

01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we hear what are really
the more intriguing theories,

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the ideas that the people
here could actually

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
fly in giant man-lifting
kites, perhaps

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.145 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of primitive
balloon technology.

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:53.855 align:middle line:90%


01:25:53.855 --> 01:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Or even the ideas that
somehow extraterrestrials

01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.480 align:middle line:84%
were coming here or that
even ancient man had

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.730 align:middle line:90%
the ability of flight.

01:26:03.730 --> 01:26:05.788 align:middle line:90%
Use of vimanas.

01:26:05.788 --> 01:26:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Eduardo told us about
the many legends

01:26:09.690 --> 01:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
of the birdmen of the Incas
and how they could fly.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the whole
concept of ancient technology

01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
technology of flight.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Nearly everyone agrees that
the geoglyphs and the lines

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and the trapezoids
and the spirals

01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and other strange figures
on the Nazca plain

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.960 align:middle line:84%
were meant to be
seen from the air.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Were they meant to
be seen by vague gods

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in the sky who could
be seen in the stars?

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Or were they flesh-and-blood
gods who had flying machines

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and could fly over the plain?

01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:58.620 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for certain.

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
The Nazca plain is
like a giant canvas

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
in the desert in
which all these lines

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and figures and
geometric trapezoids

01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
are etched onto
this vast landscape.

01:27:16.170 --> 01:27:19.097 align:middle line:84%
The question remains
though, who was it for?

01:27:19.097 --> 01:27:26.090 align:middle line:90%


01:27:26.090 --> 01:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the strange
legends here in Peru

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:31.290 align:middle line:90%
is of an ancient tunnel system.

01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
This tunnel system
is supposed to start

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in Cusco around the
Temple of the Sun there,

01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and it goes to Saqsaywaman
and other areas in the Andes.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:46.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the legends is that the
ancient treasure of the Incas

01:27:46.530 --> 01:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
was removed during the
time of the conquest

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and put into this tunnel
system, at least for a while.

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
There are even stories that this
tunnel system goes for hundreds

01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of miles through the Andes and
down into the deserts of Peru.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:09.780 align:middle line:90%


01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we're on the
Pan-American Highway,

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
going through the
desert towards Ica,

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and we've stopped here at
this roadside attraction

01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:22.500 align:middle line:90%
called Freedom Park.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.378 align:middle line:84%
Freedom Park here
kind of shows you

01:28:24.378 --> 01:28:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that you can have a museum
out here in the desert.

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Just about anywhere
you want, really.

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%


01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:49.016 align:middle line:84%
Mark is saying there's tektites
out here plus moldavite.

01:28:49.016 --> 01:28:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
this whole area got

01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
rained down with some
kind of meteoric shower

01:28:57.390 --> 01:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
of melted stones and
glass and tektites.

01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Kind of makes you wonder if
maybe some ancient atomic war

01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:09.096 align:middle line:90%
was fought around here.

01:29:09.096 --> 01:29:19.520 align:middle line:90%


01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So Mark here is telling me
that he knew Dr. Cabrera who

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
passed away in 2001 in
Ica where we just were

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.740 align:middle line:90%
and visiting his museum.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you think he had his
own ideas and theories that he

01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
wanted to show to
people, so he had

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:49.720 align:middle line:90%
the rocks made to demonstrate?

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
He have to complete the chain
of the story in any way.

01:29:57.910 --> 01:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>So did he believe then
that humans and the dinosaurs

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:05.060 align:middle line:84%
lived together, or
something like that?

01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>Well, I believe
part of the story

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
may be not humans exactly,
but people from outer space

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
had been here a long time ago,
maybe watching the dinosaurs

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.010 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:30:17.010 --> 01:30:19.397 align:middle line:90%
And someone could draw it on.

01:30:19.397 --> 01:30:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's true,
maybe it's fiction.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>But what about his book?

01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:30.270 align:middle line:84%
He wrote also that book,
"Message of the Ica Stones."

01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the book is,
like I told you,

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe in his mind
when he told me,

01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:40.970 align:middle line:84%
this book's going
to be in the movies

01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
someday maybe in the future.

01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:44.472 align:middle line:90%
So I think he had--

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:48.365 align:middle line:84%
>>He wanted his book to
be made into a movie then,

01:30:48.365 --> 01:30:49.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's what he thought.

01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OK.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And he had his own ideas
of flying saucers at Nazca,

01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and things like that, right?

01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:04.620 align:middle line:84%
He have a lot of theories
about the places,

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious places of this
part of the south of Peru,

01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:09.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:31:09.190 --> 01:31:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And he knew about a
lot, really a lot.

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I think he saw in the future
to make us famous maybe

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
on the world with this story.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:22.830 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that.

01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I hope that.

01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>He was from Ica, so he
wanted Ica be famous like that.

01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we have good
history here, really.

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
With stories about
Paracas and Nazca,

01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I think people are going to
be investigating about it

01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and never going
to get the truth.

01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>So you think-- I mean, did he
enjoy fooling a lot of people?

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Or I mean, you know?

01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Maybe he play with
the brain of the people.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, maybe.

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Because he was very
intelligent, so maybe it

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.540 align:middle line:90%
was his comic movie, you know?

01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>His comic movie.

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>He was laughing all the time.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:15.100 align:middle line:90%


01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>So you never really know what
you're going to find out here

01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:23.580 align:middle line:90%
in the deserts of Peru.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.236 align:middle line:84%
We've seen a lot of
strange stuff on this trip.

01:32:26.236 --> 01:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We saw Dr. Cabrera's strange
cabinet of curiosities.

01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:37.970 align:middle line:84%
We saw the weird cone heads
in the Ica Regional Museum.

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we saw the strange
geoglyphs and lines at Nazca.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long,
strange trip, but if you

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
do happen to come
here to Peru, be sure

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.670 align:middle line:84%
you occasionally stop at
some of the strange things

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:56.458 align:middle line:90%
that you find along the highway.

01:32:56.458 --> 01:33:02.548 align:middle line:10%
